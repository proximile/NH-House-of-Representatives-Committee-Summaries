available and affordable child care
 
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.340 align:start position:0%

Hampshire's economy struggling with

finding workers
 
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
majority's concern of providers possibly
 
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
receiving payment when a child is absent
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
as a potential concern for the minority
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
also however the bill charges that the
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
report addressed that possibility
 
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
the report is due on or before September
 
00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:00.539 align:start position:0%
1st 2022 which will give us both the
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
actual absentee rate and leaves time to
 
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
file an LSR in the next term with real
 
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
absentee numbers and other critical data
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
and assuring a solution that works for
 
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker I rise in support of the
 
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
majority recommendation of inexpedient
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
to legislate this bill establishes the
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
child care scholarship pilot program to
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
provide enrollment-based reimbursement
 
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:39.500 align:start position:0%
to child care providers as opposed to
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
attendance-based reimbursement to child
 
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
care providers who accept Child Care
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
scholarships through the child care and
 
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
Development Fund although the committee
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
can agree that finding solutions to the
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
state's Child Care problem is important
 
00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee finds that
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
there are areas of this particular bills
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
tax that are of concern one such area of
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
concern is that the billing is set up so
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
that it should continue unless a child
 
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
exceeds two weeks of consecutive
 
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
absences from the program without
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
notification to the provider regarding
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
circumstances and agreed upon return
 
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
date this framework could allow for a
 
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
child to be absent several times a week
 
00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:17.660 align:start position:0%
and still be enrolled in the program
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
causing unnecessary costs to the program
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
and possibly preventing space for
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
another child who is in need of care
 
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340 align:start position:0%

of that Council supporting this position
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill Builds on the
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
vision builds onto governance work

already happening
 
00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:57.059 align:start position:0%
I'm of the opinion that current system
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
leaves gaps that are devastating to New
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families and children this
 
00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
office will fill those gaps and minimize
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%
if not eliminate these disadvantages
 
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
nothing is more important than early
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
childhood development such an important
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
time for the child should not end up in
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
a bureaucratic mess this office will
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
allow for greater coordination between
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
departments and programs and will

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
I rise in the support of
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
the itl motion to for SB 326 because the
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
governor already put in uh
 
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
an executive order which tasked uh
 
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
board to come up with a plan to make
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
this uh this
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
children uh
 
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.950 align:start position:0%
children uh
uh

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
this uh what was this called uh the
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
office of of the the uh
 
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
early childhood and now they're asking
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
for a bill to do the exact same thing
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
and so this this board already has money
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
and they can already make this uh plan
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
for the office of of early childhood and
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
so this bill is not necessary and I hope
 
00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that every
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
initiative focused on Early Childhood
 
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
will always bring a return on investment
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
benefiting Granite State families
 
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
and if I know that early childhood is a
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
bar bipartisan issue
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
and SB 326 creates a plan with no fiscal
 
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
note that helps execute the governor's
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
executive order directing DHHS and the
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%

Childhood care and education
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%

children is always good for New
 
00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:09.230 align:start position:0%

listening
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
if I know
 
00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
that the governor appointed a multitude
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
of us to the council for thriving
 
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.649 align:start position:0%

and if I know that in doing that his
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
Express purpose was for us to do what
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
host uh what Senate Bill 326 is asking
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
us to do

governmental bureaucracy
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
that would create such redundancy that's
 
00:27:59.570 --> 00:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
not necessary then I would vote using
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:05.700 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:45.539 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
in the very best of circumstances
 
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:51.500 align:start position:0%
parenting children is unique challenging
 
00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
rewarding time consuming and expensive
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
it is life altering and the kids
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
well they didn't have any choice about
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
much of anything in this so in theory we
 
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
all do the best we can with what we've
 
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.190 align:start position:0%
all do the best we can with what we've
got

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
co-parenting Under One Roof is tough
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
because parenting is tough not all
 
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
families live under the same roof though
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
and some of those families live under
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
separate roofs because they have extreme
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
conflict that makes parenting under the
 
00:31:31.009 --> 00:31:31.019 align:start position:0%
same roof unsafe
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
when parents don't live together and
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
share parenting duties the state of New
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire believes the guiding principle
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
in that Arrangement should be what is in
 
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:45.980 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child in SB 431
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
we are concerned with the parenting
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
issue of Child Support which is designed
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
to maintain a child's living standard
 
00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
and ensure that their needs are covered
 
00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:03.539 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 431 does state
 
00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
quote equal or approximately equal
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
parenting residential responsibilities
 
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
in and of itself shall not eliminate the
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
need for child support and shall not by
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
itself constitute grounds for adjustment
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
which translated means if a child lives
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
50 percent of the time with one parent
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
and fifty percent of the time with
 
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
another parent it does not mean that
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
child support is not in order child
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
support sometimes may very well be in
 
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.450 align:start position:0%
support sometimes may very well be in
order

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
also if a custody agreement changes from
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
a 70 30 split or a 60 40 split to 50 of
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
the time with one parent and 50 percent
 
00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
of the time with the other parent that
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
change doesn't automatically trigger an
 
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
elimination of Child Support
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
so when we establish that some children
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
spend equal amounts of time under two
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
different roofs
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
living in poverty in the other

parent's home versus the other
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
what about when they're old enough to

drive who pays for drivers education or

car insurance
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
the answers to those questions are in
 
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
our child support formulas but how do we
 
00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
come up with the formula based on but
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
how did we come up with this formula and
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
as is required in our current statute
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau of Child Support is
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
conducting a review of all of our policy
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines and the report will be re
 
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
completed and released to us
 
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
at at the end of December of 2022.
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
the child and family law committee heard
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
from mediators who work with these
 
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
parents and pointed out that the
 
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
guidelines are not clear and this has
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
led to a lot of litigation
 
00:34:35.569 --> 00:34:35.579 align:start position:0%
what we heard that a fair way to
 
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
determine what is in the best interest
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's children is to have a
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
net the difference calculation
 
00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
when the higher earning parent earns
 
00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:49.069 align:start position:0%
when the higher earning parent earns
less

00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
then 60 of the total parental net income
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
the difference between the two is the
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
determining factor in calculating child
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
support this formula added to the
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines would achieve a reasonably
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
similar lifestyle in each home
 
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.470 align:start position:0%
similar lifestyle in each home
but

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment that just passed for
 
00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:15.020 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 431 instead
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
complicates an already complicated
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
process even further by adding in a
 
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
requirement of a 120 percent multiplier
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
be added to the formula before getting
 
00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
to the net the difference number if your
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
head is spinning it should be because
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
it's absolute chaos it appears to be
 
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
designed to further muck up a system
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
that parents mediators and Advocates are
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
desperate to have better clarification
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
on ultimately child support is supposed
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
to be in the best interest of the
 
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.730 align:start position:0%
to be in the best interest of the
children

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 431 as we just amended it
 
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
Children and Families would be better
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
served if this body would now wait for
 
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
the statutorily required report to be
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
completed with the most accurate and
 
00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:07.859 align:start position:0%

best interest of New Hampshire's
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
children thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Ocala to
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:27.370 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:27.380 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
Bill requires that the the judges only
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
consider the best interests of the child
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
as it came to us from the from the
 
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
Senate there were the best interests of
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
the child and other considerations also
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be considered equally with
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
the best interests of the child so in
 
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
cases where it didn't meet those other
 
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.630 align:start position:0%
cases where it didn't meet those other
qualifications

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
this adjustment wouldn't be appropriate
 
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
even though it was found to be in the
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child and the first
 
00:37:01.329 --> 00:37:01.339 align:start position:0%
instance and so there's
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
so this bill cleans up that issue and it
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
also as was talked about before when you
 
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.530 align:start position:0%
also as was talked about before when you
have

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:08.540 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:11.339 align:start position:0%
raising child in two households it costs
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
more money
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
and the bill did not increase the amount
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
of money going towards that raising of
 
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
the child for for having two households
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
and that 120 percent that was talked
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
about is that increase so more money is
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
going towards the kids raising of
 
00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:32.420 align:start position:0%
children in this instance and there was
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
a talk about
 
00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:36.910 align:start position:0%
a talk about
equal

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
equal
 
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:41.099 align:start position:0%
you know households and and one being
 
00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:44.099 align:start position:0%
rich one not being rich and that is not
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh the purpose of child support the
 
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
purpose of Child Support is to raise the
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
kids not for wealth redistribution and
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
so we need to make sure that we are
 
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
providing people
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
the means to provide the best
 
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
care that's in the best interest of
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
children end of story and so I hope that
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
you will vote uh ought to pass with the
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%

ninety percent of cases settle their

child support

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
a guideline that benefits the 10 percent

thank you Mr speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
know the child support should always be
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
calculated in the best interest of the
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
children by increasing funds to raise
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
those children
 
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
and if I know that Senate Bill 431 as
 
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
amended assures that the Court's Focus
 
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:16.940 align:start position:0%
will be in that interest without
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
extraneous limitations and finally Mr
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I am positive that as amended
 
00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 431 is completely

and thoroughly in the best interest of
 
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:34.020 align:start position:0%

00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
this bill is not a covet bill it is a
 
00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:50.579 align:start position:0%
health care savings model that can be
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
utilized for other preventable diseases
 
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
it is example of preventative Wellness
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a sickness model of Health
 
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
Care and what do I mean by this our
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
health care System currently makes a
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
profit when it performs tests and does
 
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
procedures on sick people it is not
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
rewarded for doing preventive care or
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
for reducing the overall cost of care
 
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
and I'll I will give you an example of
 
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
this my husband and I annually go see a
 
00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
physician in Vidalia Georgia every year
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
for a wellness exam because this
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
physician specializes in is in this and
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
by the way I don't recommend going to
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
Vidalia Georgia
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
now after the test it was a two-day
 
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
procedure a two-day process
 
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
um I found that I had um enlarged not
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
thyroid nodules that had to be biopsies
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
thankfully they were benign but they
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
still need to be monitored today my
 
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
husband was found to be low in vitamin
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
B12 with if left untreated could have
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
led to premature dementia
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
cost for the exam was significantly less
 
00:51:53.329 --> 00:51:53.339 align:start position:0%
than the cost to treat thyroid cancer or
 
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
dementia and it was completely covered
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
by Medicare most health care
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
organizations in New Hampshire still do
 
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
not have well-developed Wellness
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
programs which could save our health
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
care System millions of dollars annually
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
consider this bill that invests in
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
lowering the cost of care and improving
 
00:52:11.089 --> 00:52:11.099 align:start position:0%

00:52:21.049 --> 00:52:21.059 align:start position:0%
to pass this Wellness Bill thank you
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
do you recognizer representative Gleason
 
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
does remember yield to questions
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
does the member yield the questions
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 319 is not even necessary to
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
pass because insurance companies can
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
already offer incentives if they should
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
choose to do so
 
00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.730 align:start position:0%
choose to do so
secondly

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
the only thing ever discussed during the
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
hearings about this bill was covet
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine I think we have reached a point
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
of coveted weariness those who have
 
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
received the vaccine have done so those
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
who don't want to receive the vaccine
 
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
probably not going to regardless of the
 
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.470 align:start position:0%
probably not going to regardless of the
incentive

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
thirdly nothing in this bill protects
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
anyone who should reject any kind of an
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
incentive regardless of their reason for
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
wanting it I don't want the gym
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
membership I don't want the vaccine I
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't want the pizza whatever it is no
 
00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.059 align:start position:0%
one said anything about partaking what
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
if somebody just doesn't want the
 
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
incentive and there's nothing to protect
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
them from any future discrimination or
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
any kind of adverse treatment following
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
rejecting that incentive
 
00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
so with that I ask you to please press
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
the green button so we can kill this
 
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you does a member yield the
 
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.770 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you does a member yield the
questions

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
sure remember yields May inquire thank
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker and thank you for taking
 
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:52.730 align:start position:0%
my question
um

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't it the case at the public hearing
 
00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:56.780 align:start position:0%
that the insurance commissioner came in
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
and told us that some insurance
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
companies wanted this because the
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
current federal laws and federal
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
regulations are vague and they needed
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
the insurance commissioner would need
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
some type of state law to give them
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
something some clarity wasn't that the
 
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
they had the question of whether or not
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
they could offer incentives and it was
 
00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
determined that they can already offer
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
incentives any kind of confusion I'm not
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure what their confusion actually was
 
00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
that that I don't know follow-up
 
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
remember yield the further questions uh
 
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
one last one we're getting weary on the
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
main foyer
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
um we go by the text of the bill rather
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
than necessarily what stated during the
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
hearing isn't it so that in the text of
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
the bill that this could be an incentive
 
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
for any type of vaccine even past
 
00:54:44.329 --> 00:54:44.339 align:start position:0%
vaccines that people have got for polio
 
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
or smallpox or some other condition so
 
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
there's no incentives for
 
00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:50.829 align:start position:0%
there's no incentives for
past

00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines it's only going forward and the
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
only vaccine ever mentioned was covid so
 
00:54:58.609 --> 00:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
there's not even an incentive to get
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
smallpox vaccine and no one since 1969
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
or 70 in their child regular childhood
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinations received a smallpox so why
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
aren't we incentivizing kids to get the
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
smallpox vaccine
 
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:17.339 align:start position:0%

the motion before us is the majority
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
committee report of inexperience of
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
legislative and Senate Bill 319 this is
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
a division vote the chair recognizes
 
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
representative Weston for a

00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
if I know that insurance companies do
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
not penalize the customer if they choose
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
not to take advantage of a cent of an
 
00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.930 align:start position:0%
not to take advantage of a cent of an
incentive

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this is enabling
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
legislation just designed to encourage
 
00:57:24.289 --> 00:57:24.299 align:start position:0%
Wellness rather than to treat sickness
 
00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this will help
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers to reduce costs and
 
00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:32.579 align:start position:0%

if Mr Speaker if I know that an
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
if they can scientifically calculate
 
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
that it will reduce costs so at this
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
point Mr Speaker well I now pass the

01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:34.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 355 would require
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
high-volume online marketplaces such as
 
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
Amazon to collect basic information
 
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
about their third-party Sellers and then
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
to annually verify that that information
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
is genuine
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the hearing for this bill which by
 
01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
the way had no testimony in opposition
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
we heard that Smash and grab threats our
 
01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
growing concern in New Hampshire and
 
01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
that online marketplaces provide cover
 
01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:08.339 align:start position:0%
for sellers of stolen goods
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
but the much bigger problem is what
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
retailers call organized retail crime we
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
heard that thefts are occurring of
 
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
truckloads of brand new items still in
 
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
their original packaging these items are
 
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
then being sold as new online by Shifty
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers
 
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
Additionally the Online Marketplace
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
provides cover for counterfeit and
 
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
pirated goods worth an estimated 500
 
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
billion a year in global trade
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
this is particularly dangerous in the
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
field of pharmaceuticals with
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
counterfeit drugs becoming more and more
 
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.849 align:start position:0%
counterfeit drugs becoming more and more
common

01:01:46.849 --> 01:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
common
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
currently on Amazon's site a third-party
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
seller is able to set up an account with
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
false information a false tax ID false
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
address false phone number because that
 
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
information is never verified by Amazon
 
01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:06.299 align:start position:0%
when the buyer then has a product
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
complaint Amazon famously will return
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
your money
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
but as that's as far as they go they
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
take no responsibility for harm because
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
they are not really the seller
 
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
essentially Amazon will tell you to go
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
pound sand
 
01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
this legislation would go a long way
 
01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
towards providing transparency
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
accountability and much needed deterrent
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
to thieves and counterfeiters
 
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
so the question is why do we need
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
both the New Hampshire Police
 
01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:45.539 align:start position:0%
Association and the New Hampshire retail
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
association strongly supported this bill
 
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
and consider it Priority legislation
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
they like this bill as it is and they
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
see no need to study it further
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
similar legislation has been passed in
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
other states because this is a good
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
solid solution
 
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
and then their 12 States considering
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
they're another 12 States now
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
considering this business friendly
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
transparent transparency Focus
 
01:03:13.319 --> 01:03:14.690 align:start position:0%
transparent transparency Focus
legislation

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
so please vote against interim studies
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
so that we can move this bill along with
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
ought to pass thank you
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Terry to
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
SB 355 FN provides all of us with an
 
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
excellent case study on the question of
 
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
the proper place
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
necessity role and timing for government
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
and in this circumstance our state's
 
01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
government to become involved in a
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
matter of Commerce claimed by some to be
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
begging for our action
 
01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
the majority of the Commerce and
 
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
consumer affairs committee have
 
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully and carefully come to the
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
conclusion that a compelling case cannot
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
be made at this time for us to accept
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
the plea for legislative action to
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
resolve what is claimed by some online
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
marketplaces to be a problem they and
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
some consumers are experiencing with
 
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
transactions that involve so-called
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
third-party high volume sellers
 
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
as represented To Us by the Bill's
 
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
sponsors consumers are being victimized
 
01:04:38.329 --> 01:04:38.339 align:start position:0%
both by online marketplaces run by
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
entities such as Amazon and Walmart and
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
certain third-party sellers with whom
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
these entities have Arrangements that
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
permit the third party sellers to Market
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
their products through the Online
 
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.230 align:start position:0%
their products through the Online
Marketplace

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
Marketplace
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
seriously however none of the 19 members
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
of our committee could identify a single
 
01:05:01.079 --> 01:05:02.089 align:start position:0%
of our committee could identify a single
instance

01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
in which an online marketer refused to
 
01:05:08.329 --> 01:05:08.339 align:start position:0%
resolve a dispute in their favor
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
to put this positively the online
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
marketer accepted responsibility for the
 
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
transaction as if it had been their own
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
and proceeded to make things right
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
further we did not hear testimony from a
 
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
single consumer claiming otherwise and
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
finally when we asked the representative
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
of the State's Department of Justice if
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
he could tell us how many complaints
 
01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:35.099 align:start position:0%
have been received by his office he said
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
he was unable to identify any
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
rather we heard from a handful of Online
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
Marketplace entities in their lobbyists
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
who the majority concluded that the
 
01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
relief they were seeking was not
 
01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
convincing because in addition to the
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
distinct and pronounced lack of consumer
 
01:05:58.029 --> 01:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
complaints the question remains
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
unresolved as to why the online
 
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:03.380 align:start position:0%
marketers seeking our intervention
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
cannot manage the entirely voluntary
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
relationships into which they agreed to
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
enter with third-party sellers unless
 
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
they received the assistance of
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
government and yet another law
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
simply put why is government needed when
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
government does not appear to be needed
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
either for the Online Marketplace
 
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
entities or for consumers who may
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
already utilize existing consumer

01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
out why an online Marketplace entities
 
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
such as Amazon or Walmart cannot on

do not and will not practice the same or

there are no consumers being harmed here
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
that belongs if Mr Speaker if I believe
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
that belongs in the criminal statute
 
01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
not the consumer protection act which
 
01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
only guarantees
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
that you get your money back
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
if Mr Speaker if I know the people who
 
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
are being harmed
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
are not the consumers but but
 
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
corporations the businesses who are
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
having the theft
 
01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
and therefore this bill is in the wrong
 
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:18.290 align:start position:0%
and therefore this bill is in the wrong
statute

before you
 
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
you may recognize because it's a bill
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
that you've already passed it's HB 629
 
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
we passed this bill by a two to one
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
majority and sent it to the other body
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
where it was apparently
 
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
not given good consideration
 
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
I feel like this term all of us on both
 
01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:54.290 align:start position:0%

sides

01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%

01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
have put a lot of work into bills where
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
we convinced the majority of 400 people
 
01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
to pass a bill
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
only to have it die for no apparent
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
reason so we're going to send it again
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
to give him another chance
 
01:22:13.129 --> 01:22:13.139 align:start position:0%
this bill passed as I said by a two to
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
one majority in this house
 
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:20.340 align:start position:0%

01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
the amendment is 1764 H Clinton and
 
01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:30.860 align:start position:0%
house record 17 pages
 
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
74-76. are you ready for the question on
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment all those in favor say aye
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
that was a postnay
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
you guys have it in the many amendment
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
is adopted bills on second reading open
 
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
to further Amendment
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment is Bixby floor Amendment
 
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
1-899-h it's in your seat pockets and
 
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes sen of Bixby to
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
speak to the amendment
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
the committee adopted the committee
 
01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh and unanimously but one
 
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
reason that some people voted on interim
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
study on the bill was that Des had had
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
not had a chance to review the committee
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment and this floor amendment is
 
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
the result of that review
 
01:27:25.330 --> 01:27:25.340 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick uh bit of orientation
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
Advanced recycling is taking Plastics
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
which are long chain polymers and
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
breaking them down into small organic
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
molecules and those organic molecules
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
can be used to make new plastic they can
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
also be used as fuel and that brings up
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:42.950 align:start position:0%
one of the
um

01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
points in the committee amendment that
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
was clarified in the floor Amendment
 
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
which is that in order to count as
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
the re the the facility cannot use these
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
molecules as fuel they have to use them
 
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
for recycling any use and the uh the
 
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
floor amendment clarifies that any use
 
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
of these as fuel within the facility
 
01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
would count as waste not as fuel
 
01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:14.060 align:start position:0%
and not as not as product
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
another issue
 
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
that the committee that the floor
 
01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment clarify clarifies is uh that
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh there are some right there were some
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
regulatory changes that the committee
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
amendment made that Des said did
 
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
actually actually didn't uh make sense
 
01:28:36.169 --> 01:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
in terms of the way that they do the
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
regulations and those have been changed
 
01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're in conformance
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
with the way that Des works and finally
 
01:28:46.729 --> 01:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the committee
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment does is it indicates how uh
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
the products of advanced recycling get
 
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
used as uh in in terms of waste
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
reduction goals and Des suggested that
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
we should also indicate that we the
 
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.050 align:start position:0%
we should also indicate that we the
um

01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
that part of the bill should show where
 
01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:09.260 align:start position:0%
or should ask a reporting on where the
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
plastic comes from that gets recycled
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
because another point of the bill says
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
that the plastic that gets recycled
 
01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:19.139 align:start position:0%
should be a priority it should By
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
Priority come from New Hampshire so
 
01:29:23.570 --> 01:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
those are the changes that the four
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
amendment makes and I hope that you
 
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
the emotion before us is the Bixby Flora
 
01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
the emotion before us is the Bixby Flora
Amendment

01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say aye
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
those opposed nay
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it in a bits before
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
amendment is adopted motion before us
 
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
now is ought to pass as amended
 
01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Megan

01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
this in our world from food packaging to
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
toys to plastic car seats that expire
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
let's not forget those plastic building
 
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
blocks that are often a late night
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
Hazard my feet find
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
I want nothing more than to find a way
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
to safely and responsibly deal with the
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
copious amounts of plastic we have in
 
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
our society
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
today I respectfully rise in opposition
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
to the motion of otpa as the chair of
 
01:30:29.410 --> 01:30:29.420 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee work group on SB
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
367 tasked with hearing testimony on the
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
subject of plastic and chemical
 
01:30:36.649 --> 01:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
recycling over the past few weeks we had
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
to very we had the opportunity to hear
 
01:30:40.129 --> 01:30:40.139 align:start position:0%
from various stakeholders sharing their
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
hopes desires aspirations and concerns
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
around the use of plastic Sid's
 
01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
feedstock and chemically heating
 
01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
recycling as a regulated industry here
 
01:30:50.689 --> 01:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire should we regulate it
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely but not in such a harried
 
01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.110 align:start position:0%
absolutely but not in such a harried
manner

01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
manner
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately in a four to three bipartisan
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
vote the bill was recommended for
 
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
interim study while it's certainly tried
 
01:31:02.689 --> 01:31:02.699 align:start position:0%
to create a regulatory framework around
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
this scientifically complex process of
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
heating Plastics into a liquid soup of
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
sorts that would winnow out individual
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
chemical components into new plastic
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
items the bill fell short in other areas
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
and moved too quickly leaving many
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
questions unanswered questions range
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
from environmental concerns landfilling
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
potentialities and consumer safety and
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
transparency concerns simply put the
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
bill isn't ready
 
01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
many Plastics are not yet recyclable in
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
this way which leads one to wonder if
 
01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could be left holding the
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
bag on rejected Plastics that don't meet
 
01:31:37.729 --> 01:31:37.739 align:start position:0%
industry specs
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
and if we could be the destination for
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
untraceable loads that open the door for
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
increased rates of disposal our
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
landfills already contain over 50
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
percent of out-of-state waste and others
 
01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
regionally are unready to move forward
 
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
countries all over the world are looking
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
at this process and recognize the need
 
01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
for strong regulatory Frameworks around
 
01:31:58.129 --> 01:31:58.139 align:start position:0%
chemical recycling
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
what does one do with these materials
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
contaminants how much plastic can one
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
facility melt or heat in a day week or
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
month where exactly did the plastic used
 
01:32:10.610 --> 01:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
for melting come from and how is it
 
01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:11.750 align:start position:0%
for melting come from and how is it
sourced

01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
sourced
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
who stores the data about where it would
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
come from and in what system how would
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
this affect our Solid Waste working
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
group which is already underway
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a more than imperfect
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
track record when it comes to
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
contamination Superfund sites and
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
pollutants affecting everyone from our
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
military and First Responders to
 
01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
citizens of entire towns we owe it to
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves and each other to pump the
 
01:32:34.129 --> 01:32:34.139 align:start position:0%
brakes on this bill and craft it more
 
01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
carefully for these reasons and more I
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
humbly ask you that you press the red
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
button in opposition to the motion
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
before us so that another motion can be
 
01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
made thank you
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
which I recognize representative mole of
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
speak for the committee report
 
01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:55.310 align:start position:0%
 
recommendation

01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:32:58.729 --> 01:32:58.739 align:start position:0%
for 367. this bill seeks to encourage
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
innovation in the field of advanced
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
recycling in New Hampshire and it does
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
this by creating a clear regulatory
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
structure for this industry under our
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing laws
 
01:33:12.770 --> 01:33:12.780 align:start position:0%
how to best manage the recycling in the
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
ReUse of plastics is a growing priority
 
01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
for us all and the public has been

market-based opportunity
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
to do just that by making it possible to
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
recycle a wide variety of post-used
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
plastics into new products particularly
 
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:40.139 align:start position:0%
using some Plastics that are currently

01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
this invaluable testimony enabled our
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
committee to thoroughly evaluate the
 
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
concept of advanced recycling through

thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:37:32.209 --> 01:37:32.219 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that these proposed
 
01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:34.860 align:start position:0%
that these proposed plastic processing
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
facilities could in theory reduce the
 
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
amount of waste going to landfill and
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
incinerators in our state but that
 
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
important questions remain
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
namely around getting the most

protective language to Public Health and

Mr Speaker if I also know that by
 
01:37:59.090 --> 01:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
adopting this bill as it stands we would
 
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
be jumping heedlessly ahead of federal
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
Regulators namely the Environmental
 
01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency which is at this
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
moment drafting a regulatory framework
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
for these proposed chemical recycling
 
01:38:12.770 --> 01:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
facilities by seeking information more
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
information than we have currently
 
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
available to us here in New Hampshire on
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
the industrial processes on the products
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
and the waste byproducts of these
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
industrial processes and that the
 
01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:25.860 align:start position:0%
anticipated regulatory ruling would in
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
fact Aid us
 
01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as we seek to craft
 
01:38:31.729 --> 01:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
rules around these proposed facilities
 
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
important stakeholder groups in the
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
state with long standings such as the
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
scrap metal recycling industry and the
 
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
paper and Forest products industry have
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
expressed reservations on the language
 
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
of this bill and have not had their

approach to address solid waste policy
 
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
also if I know that advanced recycling
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
of plastics is one more step we can take
 
01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
to reuse currently unrecycled Plastics
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
rather than sending these Plastics to
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%

representative leakis to speak against

01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:44:19.970 --> 01:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
this bill would prohibit the requirement
 
01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
of project labor agreements plas in
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
state government and state government
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
assisted construction contracts it would
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
not affect local contracts that were not
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
supported by the state
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
first let me address one of the most
 
01:44:34.729 --> 01:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
important concerns raised by the
 
01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
committee of majority the concern is
 
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
that because the bill includes any
 
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
project in an area subject RSA 79e which
 
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
is the community revitalization tax
 
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
relief incentive and because some major
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
federal grants require the use of
 
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements New Hampshire
 
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
communities would would not be eligible
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
for these grants for important
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects
 
01:45:00.169 --> 01:45:00.179 align:start position:0%
this would be a valid concern that I
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
would share if this bill actually
 
01:45:04.129 --> 01:45:04.139 align:start position:0%
prevented New Hampshire communities from
 
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
accepting these grants
 
01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
the bill contains an exemption that
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
would certainly apply in these cases
 
01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
it provides that a government entity May
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
exempt a particular project contract or
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
subcontract from the requirements of any
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
or all of the provisions of the bill if
 
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
the governmental unit finds that special
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances require an exemption
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
they would first have a have to have a
 
01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
public notice and hearing justifying the
 
01:45:31.609 --> 01:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
need for an exemption the possibility of
 
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
losing grants from hundreds of thousands
 
01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
to a hundred million dollars would
 
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
certainly justify such an exemption
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
over 90 percent of the contractors in
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do not operate under a
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement
 
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
these contractors are organized in
 
01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
various ways
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
many have their own apprenticeship and
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
safety programs some are employee owned
 
01:45:57.290 --> 01:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
some organize it at teams that are
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
experienced working together to get the
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
job done well and quickly
 
01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
they offer attractive pay and benefits
 
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
how could they do otherwise in this
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
environment where it is very difficult
 
01:46:10.129 --> 01:46:10.139 align:start position:0%
to find trades people for any project if
 
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
they offered poor pay or working
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
conditions they would quickly lose their
 
01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:14.810 align:start position:0%
conditions they would quickly lose their
employees

01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:46:18.129 --> 01:46:18.139 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill would prevent
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
contractors that operate under a
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement from
 
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
bidding on and winning these contracts
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
plas would not benefit the workers with
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
a pla the benefits and training funds
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
stay with the Union not the employee
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
non-union workers on a pla job will
 
01:46:39.169 --> 01:46:39.179 align:start position:0%
continue will contribute money for union
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
benefits and training that they will
 
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
never receive because the job won't last
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
long enough for them to vest in those
 
01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
benefit plans
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
plas often require the adoption of rigid
 
01:46:51.649 --> 01:46:51.659 align:start position:0%
work rules that reduce efficiency and
 
01:46:53.090 --> 01:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
increase costs
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
construction is a highly regulated
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
industry with high standards for safety
 
01:46:59.629 --> 01:46:59.639 align:start position:0%
oversight by OSHA insurance requirements
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
bonding training standards and more
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
these standards are enforced by existing

state procurement laws all without plas

When government mandates a pla it can
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
cost taxpayers an additional 20 percent
 
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
or more for construction
 
01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
our job is to provide the infrastructure
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
our constituents need without costing
 
01:47:21.050 --> 01:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
them more than absolutely necessary
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is successfully and
 
01:47:24.169 --> 01:47:24.179 align:start position:0%
efficiently completed many construction
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
projects over the years without
 
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
requiring project labor agreements this
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%

honorable colleagues Senate Bill 274
 
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
will put New Hampshire's ability to

certain grants impossible
 
01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:04.679 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to prospectively

blocking this grant moving forward on
 
01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
ideological grounds would deprived New
 
01:49:29.089 --> 01:49:29.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of these funds and the local
 
01:49:31.250 --> 01:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
jobs they would generate it would not be

01:49:36.589 --> 01:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
even had testified in opposition to this
 
01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.850 align:start position:0%
even had testified in opposition to this
section

01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
and the problem is not unique to this
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
one Grant if this bill were to become
 
01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:46.129 align:start position:0%
one Grant if this bill were to become

law
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire D.O.T would likely be less
 
01:49:50.089 --> 01:49:50.099 align:start position:0%
able to access other competitive grants
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
with similar requirements such as the

some of the rules governing the awarding
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
of infrastructure grants are still in
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
the process of being written and it is
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
premature and dangerous to pass this
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
type of legislation now without knowing
 
01:50:25.490 --> 01:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences especially
 
01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
when a consequence could be a burden on
 
01:50:30.530 --> 01:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire taxpayer
 
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
and I ask if plas are good enough for
 
01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
large companies such as Walmart and
 
01:50:38.450 --> 01:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
Toyota motor corporations to use on
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
their construction projects that might
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
please be a tool New Hampshire would
 
01:50:44.209 --> 01:50:44.219 align:start position:0%
want to employ at some point in the
 
01:50:44.219 --> 01:50:45.350 align:start position:0%
want to employ at some point in the
future

01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:50:48.589 --> 01:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
why take that option away
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
I believe we as legislators should be
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
supporting bills that seek to solve
 
01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
problems that our state is actually
 
01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.550 align:start position:0%
problems that our state is actually
facing

01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
facing
 
01:50:57.290 --> 01:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
and as New Hampshire has never had a
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
project labor agreement this bill seems
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
only to add government red tape and
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
further regulation to the New Hampshire
 
01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
construction industry
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
and let me repeat New Hampshire has
 
01:51:11.209 --> 01:51:11.219 align:start position:0%
never mandated apla for the state
 
01:51:13.609 --> 01:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
funded construction projects and its
 
01:51:13.619 --> 01:51:14.510 align:start position:0%
funded construction projects and its
history

01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:51:16.129 --> 01:51:16.139 align:start position:0%
so there is no need to prohibit
 
01:51:18.890 --> 01:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
something that has never happened
 
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
passing to house passing Senate Bill 274
 
01:51:23.450 --> 01:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
will also jeopardize New Hampshire's
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
ability to receive millions of dollars
 
01:51:27.169 --> 01:51:27.179 align:start position:0%
in federal funding for infrastructure
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
money that is needed to repair our
 
01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
deteriorating roads and bridges
 
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
please support the bipartisan vote of
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and press the
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%

chair recognizes representative turcott

01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
if I know that free market principles
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
and competition will always produce the
 
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
best costs on state construction
 
01:54:06.649 --> 01:54:06.659 align:start position:0%
projects and therefore will Advantage
 
01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers
 
01:54:10.370 --> 01:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that contractors who
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
use or do not use organized labor in
 
01:54:14.689 --> 01:54:14.699 align:start position:0%
their Workforce should receive neither
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
preferential or detrimental treatment in
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
the bidding process
 
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
and if I know this bill would not
 
01:54:23.089 --> 01:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
prevent communities of the state from
 
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
accepting federal grants that require
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
finally Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
01:54:32.089 --> 01:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
decision to utilize or not utilize any
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements should be at
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the contractor with
 
01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
the bidding winning bid and one of that
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
I now press the red button to overturn
 
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
the current motion so another motion can
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
be made thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
which I recognize representative merner
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:59.089 --> 01:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
labor agreement and construction project
 
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
what makes this bill a solution
 
01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:03.300 align:start position:0%
searching for a problem and if I know
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
the definition of government assisted
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
project in this bill would block a 100
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
million dollar grant that the city of
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester has applied for the buildback
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
better challenge programmed to support
 
01:55:14.530 --> 01:55:14.540 align:start position:0%
the advance of regenerative
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturing industry and Mr Speaker if
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
I know the similar Provisions in the

and other Federal infrastructure grants
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
would block New Hampshire ability to
 
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
successfully compete for multi-million
 
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
dollar grants badly needed for our
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
state's infrastructure when I now push

Responders and includes First Responders
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%

first responder
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
is already well defined
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
you can look in any dictionary or online
 
01:58:38.810 --> 01:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
source and for instance here's
 
01:58:41.089 --> 01:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
Merriam-Webster is conventional the
 
01:58:43.370 --> 01:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
sources that defines a first responder
 
01:58:46.370 --> 01:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
as a person such as a police officer or
 
01:58:49.850 --> 01:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
EMT who is among those responsible for
 
01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
going immediately to the scene of an
 
01:58:54.169 --> 01:58:54.179 align:start position:0%
accident or emergency to provide
 
01:58:54.179 --> 01:58:56.270 align:start position:0%
accident or emergency to provide
assistance

01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:58:59.330 --> 01:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
what this bill actually does is it
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
expands it expands the definition of
 
01:59:04.430 --> 01:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
first responder
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
to include many service providers
 
01:59:10.729 --> 01:59:10.739 align:start position:0%
Downstream of the actual first response
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
whether their actions come into play
 
01:59:14.450 --> 01:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
hours or for some other indefinite
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
period after the true First Response
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
during our deliberations
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned several times that this
 
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
was a uh
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
a ceremonial or symbolic recognition
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
but the ramifications of expanding
 
01:59:36.770 --> 01:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
definitions are not just symbolic
 
01:59:40.129 --> 01:59:40.139 align:start position:0%
those expanded definitions we all know
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
we all know
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
they subsequently impact salaries
 
01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:47.390 align:start position:0%
they subsequently impact salaries
benefits

01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:49.250 align:start position:0%
benefits
promotions

01:59:49.250 --> 01:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
promotions
 
01:59:52.030 --> 01:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
training organization
 
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
existing law and other bills under
 
01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:57.050 align:start position:0%
existing law and other bills under
consideration

01:59:57.050 --> 01:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
here's a perfect example
 
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
in committee the very next bill that we
 
02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
was entirely directed at First
 
02:00:11.159 --> 02:00:12.589 align:start position:0%
was entirely directed at First
Responders

02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
Responders
 
02:00:15.530 --> 02:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
the bill had a cost and that cost would
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
now be expanded if we expand the
 
02:00:21.410 --> 02:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
definition of First Responders words
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
have meaning
 
02:00:24.890 --> 02:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
make no mistake about it
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
the continual expansion of definitions
 
02:00:30.530 --> 02:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
like this means more costs
 
02:00:38.089 --> 02:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.850 --> 02:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll ask you to please
 
02:00:40.860 --> 02:00:43.850 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll ask you to please
press

02:00:43.850 --> 02:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
press
 
02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
the red button
 
02:00:47.810 --> 02:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
to vote this bill down thank you very
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
much as a member yield to questions
 
02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
remember yields was inherit any money
 
02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:56.149 align:start position:0%
remember yields was inherit any money
inquired

02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
inquired
 
02:00:57.530 --> 02:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question it
 
02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's a pretty clear issue
 
02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
here what we're doing if this bill were
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
to pass is we pushing an unfunded
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
mandate onto the towns and counties and
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
therefore should be considered
 
02:01:08.639 --> 02:01:14.870 align:start position:0%
therefore should be considered
unconstitutional

02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
well that's actually a good point thank
 
02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
you very much for making that point
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
again uh we're playing around with
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
language and words do have meaning
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
and I hate to use that old expression
 
02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences but for every
 
02:01:33.410 --> 02:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
bill that defines or that mentions uh
 
02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
First Responders yes there's the
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
possibility that we're going to pass an
 
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:43.800 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
02:01:53.209 --> 02:01:53.219 align:start position:0%
colleagues I'm not entirely sure how
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
this bill has been Twisted to the state
 
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
that that it seems to be thought of but
 
02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:00.300 align:start position:0%
here's what it is during a declared
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
State of Emergency the definition of
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
first responder has been adjusted to
 
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
assist in the more rapid reimbursement
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
of federal funds from FEMA that is what
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is it has nothing to do with
 
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
employment classification it has nothing
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
to do with the pension system it has
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the rate of which
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
people get paid all this does is it adds
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
a certain group which is mostly the dot
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
into that definition during a declared
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
state of emergency for the purpose of
 
02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
that is what this bill is
 
02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
period there's no downshifting there's
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
no costs associated people aren't
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
getting raises off of this it is simply
 
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
a classification for the federal
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
government to recognize what we're doing
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
locally when it comes to FEMA
 
02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
reimbursement period
 
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%

02:03:11.209 --> 02:03:11.219 align:start position:0%
okay president Silvia requests the roll
 
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:03.179 align:start position:0%

02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
motion before is the majority committee
 
02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
report about a pass in Senate Bill 325
 
02:04:17.089 --> 02:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call vote the
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the representative

02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
during the meaning of a term like first
 
02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:30.410 align:start position:0%
during the meaning of a term like first
responder

02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
responder
 
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
is not just symbolic because when you
 
02:04:36.770 --> 02:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
change a classification like that
 
02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of Downstream fiscal
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
and otherwise impacts
 
02:04:44.450 --> 02:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
that we can't even begin to calculate
 
02:04:47.089 --> 02:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
would I then press the red button so
 
02:04:48.770 --> 02:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
that another motion can be made thank
 
02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:51.050 align:start position:0%
that another motion can be made thank
you

02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
chair recognize reps in a McGuire for a
 
02:04:56.810 --> 02:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
bill merely creates a temporary
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
classification for the purposes of
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
including all the First Responders to a
 
02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
particular emergency in the command
 
02:05:14.930 --> 02:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
center and in the emergency organization
 
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
and if I know that it does not affect
 
02:05:20.930 --> 02:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
anyone's pay pension or other possible
 
02:05:23.450 --> 02:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
areas would I not support

it gives me great pleasure to bring
 
03:28:49.729 --> 03:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
forward this floor Amendment although I
 
03:28:51.650 --> 03:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
know sometimes four amendments can be
 
03:28:55.010 --> 03:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
difficult uh in the timeliness to
 
03:28:57.170 --> 03:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
swallow but this is a very important
 
03:29:00.309 --> 03:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
issue this plural Amendment Echoes
 
03:29:04.910 --> 03:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what the house voted on not once
 
03:29:07.130 --> 03:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
but twice
 
03:29:09.950 --> 03:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
what just to help you refresh
 
03:29:13.190 --> 03:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
this act here renews A Promise made by
 
03:29:15.950 --> 03:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
the state to municipalities and restores
 
03:29:18.050 --> 03:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
the state contribution of a portion of
 
03:29:20.330 --> 03:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
retirement costs of teachers
 
03:29:22.309 --> 03:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
firefighters and local police
 
03:29:24.650 --> 03:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
its purposes in the hopi's local
 
03:29:27.710 --> 03:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
property tax burden provided property
 
03:29:30.170 --> 03:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
tax relief to cities and towns and
 
03:29:32.450 --> 03:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
enhance public education and Public
 
03:29:36.710 --> 03:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
Safety thus this bill is so named the
 
03:29:41.750 --> 03:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
property tax relief Act of 2022.
 
03:29:46.190 --> 03:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
now why are we rehashing this type of
 
03:29:46.200 --> 03:29:47.450 align:start position:0%
now why are we rehashing this type of
discussion

03:29:47.450 --> 03:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:29:50.750 --> 03:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
it seems that you know when I grew up I
 
03:29:53.570 --> 03:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
grew up in the three Deca and you could
 
03:29:55.130 --> 03:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
always hear what the neighbors were
 
03:29:59.929 --> 03:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
doing or you could choose to ignore
 
03:30:02.570 --> 03:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
but people who live on the other side of
 
03:30:03.769 --> 03:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
the wall
 
03:30:07.910 --> 03:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
are choosing to ignore the wills
 
03:30:10.550 --> 03:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
of the people of this house
 
03:30:13.190 --> 03:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
this house got it right
 
03:30:15.950 --> 03:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
it was not voted once again like I say
 
03:30:19.070 --> 03:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
it was voted on twice and passed it went
 
03:30:21.170 --> 03:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
through the separate committees and came
 
03:30:23.150 --> 03:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
forward and passed
 
03:30:25.790 --> 03:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
it even went to the other group
 
03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
and it passed their mirror of what we
 
03:30:30.650 --> 03:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
call the Edna Committee of a four to one
 
03:30:30.660 --> 03:30:31.729 align:start position:0%
call the Edna Committee of a four to one
vote

03:30:31.729 --> 03:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
vote
 
03:30:35.030 --> 03:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
except it got tabled in the Senate
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
now what is supposed to replace it is a
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
one-time seven-high percent tax relief
 
03:30:45.349 --> 03:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
but those of you that like me wear two
 
03:30:45.359 --> 03:30:46.790 align:start position:0%
but those of you that like me wear two
hats

03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
hats
 
03:30:49.550 --> 03:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
one being the state representative and
 
03:30:52.790 --> 03:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
one being a City municipal official I'm
 
03:30:55.070 --> 03:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
vice president of the board of aldermen
 
03:30:58.969 --> 03:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
when we work a budget how can you take a
 
03:31:01.910 --> 03:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
one-year rollback from the state and
 
03:31:04.490 --> 03:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
apply it to the budget yet not have your
 
03:31:08.570 --> 03:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
budget look like a roller coaster
 
03:31:10.729 --> 03:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
what to say excuse me what the other
 
03:31:13.550 --> 03:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
group I almost said that word but what
 
03:31:14.990 --> 03:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
the other group
 
03:31:17.330 --> 03:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
kind of wants us to do is go on that
 
03:31:19.250 --> 03:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
roller coaster ride well if you want
 
03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
that go to Disney
 
03:31:25.370 --> 03:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
but in the reality world this house got
 
03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
it right we listened to the taxpayers
 
03:31:31.190 --> 03:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
who demanded relief those of you again
 
03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
that wore two hats you know exactly what
 
03:31:36.290 --> 03:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about
 
03:31:39.050 --> 03:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
so we need to have level budgeting so
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
give the opportunity to our communities
 
03:31:43.790 --> 03:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
and political Subs divisions to level
 
03:31:46.250 --> 03:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
off their particular budget this needs
 
03:31:49.790 --> 03:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
to be more than a single year fix
 
03:31:54.290 --> 03:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
so therefore I urge you to unite again
 
03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
with me as we have done in the past
 
03:32:01.250 --> 03:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
and speak with the loud voice that it
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
can permeate the wall over here
 
03:32:07.610 --> 03:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
and make them realize that we speak
 
03:32:10.190 --> 03:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
United that our constituents who are
 
03:32:12.950 --> 03:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers need property tax relief
 
03:32:14.750 --> 03:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
particularly after what we all went
 
03:32:16.969 --> 03:32:16.979 align:start position:0%
through with covid other type of things
 
03:32:19.670 --> 03:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
and other issues that are draining
 
03:32:21.950 --> 03:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities budgets
 
03:32:24.650 --> 03:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
this is timely and effective to the
 
03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
citizens of our state and I urge you all
 
03:32:30.889 --> 03:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
to unite with me and support this
 
03:32:34.550 --> 03:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
amendment a bipartisan Amendment
 
03:32:37.370 --> 03:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
to bring back home relief to our
 
03:32:39.889 --> 03:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
taxpayers thank you Mr Speaker and Mr
 
03:32:41.809 --> 03:32:41.819 align:start position:0%
Speaker may I call for a roll call
 
03:32:41.819 --> 03:32:43.250 align:start position:0%
Speaker may I call for a roll call
please

03:32:43.250 --> 03:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:32:47.090 --> 03:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:49.070 --> 03:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
I think we got a lot of work Mr Speaker
 
03:32:53.330 --> 03:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
so I say no member does not yield
 
03:32:58.010 --> 03:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:00.469 --> 03:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:33:03.050 --> 03:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
and while I agree with the previous
 
03:33:05.570 --> 03:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative that we have sent this to
 
03:33:06.650 --> 03:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
03:33:10.309 --> 03:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
they have actually passed
 
03:33:14.150 --> 03:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
for one year the exact same amount that
 
03:33:17.290 --> 03:33:17.300 align:start position:0%
he wants to send so that this would
 
03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
duplicate that and double the amount
 
03:33:23.870 --> 03:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
even with a budget surplus I don't think
 
03:33:26.570 --> 03:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's what we want
 
03:33:28.910 --> 03:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
well maybe we do but I it's not what I
 
03:33:34.610 --> 03:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
want the other thing is that the
 
03:33:37.490 --> 03:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
the matter of State contributions to
 
03:33:40.610 --> 03:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
local Retirement Systems will be dealt
 
03:33:40.620 --> 03:33:41.630 align:start position:0%
local Retirement Systems will be dealt
with

03:33:41.630 --> 03:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:33:45.349 --> 03:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
for this year by a one-time payment and
 
03:33:48.650 --> 03:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
for next year it it will be as it ought
 
03:33:51.889 --> 03:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
to be in the budget rather than in a
 
03:33:53.450 --> 03:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
separate bill in a committee that
 
03:33:55.849 --> 03:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't really deal with money so I hope
 
03:33:58.670 --> 03:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
you'll reject this floor Amendment
 
03:34:00.710 --> 03:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
allow the
 
03:34:03.229 --> 03:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
other bills that we have passed on this
 
03:34:04.969 --> 03:34:04.979 align:start position:0%
exact same issue be dealt with
 
03:34:04.979 --> 03:34:06.590 align:start position:0%
exact same issue be dealt with
appropriately

03:34:06.590 --> 03:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:14.809 --> 03:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the O'Brien
 
03:34:17.929 --> 03:34:17.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:20.090 --> 03:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
percent of O'Brien has requested a roll
 
03:34:22.610 --> 03:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
call is that sufficiently seconded
 
03:34:24.830 --> 03:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
03:34:53.269 --> 03:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:53.279 --> 03:35:20.450 align:start position:0%
 
Instagram

03:35:20.450 --> 03:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:22.670 --> 03:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
members will take their seats also come
 
03:35:25.370 --> 03:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:27.769 --> 03:35:27.779 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the O'Brien
 
03:35:29.150 --> 03:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment
 
03:35:32.210 --> 03:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
it's a roll call vote
 
03:35:34.250 --> 03:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Brian
 
03:35:38.090 --> 03:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that a
 
03:35:45.229 --> 03:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
promise made is the promise kept is the
 
03:35:47.389 --> 03:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
guidelines the good men and women of
 
03:35:47.399 --> 03:35:48.710 align:start position:0%
guidelines the good men and women of
integrity

03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
and that this if I also know that this
 
03:35:53.929 --> 03:35:53.939 align:start position:0%
house voted not once
 
03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
but twice and about hopefully to do it a
 
03:35:59.809 --> 03:35:59.819 align:start position:0%
third time baby in support this
 
03:36:01.729 --> 03:36:01.739 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
03:36:04.610 --> 03:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
and if I also know there's nowhere that
 
03:36:07.969 --> 03:36:07.979 align:start position:0%
I can see any doubling or no doubling is
 
03:36:10.370 --> 03:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
intended into this
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
but let's would you then go with me and
 
03:36:17.030 --> 03:36:17.040 align:start position:0%

unified voice that we have done in the
past

03:36:19.849 --> 03:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
past
 
03:36:23.030 --> 03:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
over to the other body to let our
 
03:36:26.090 --> 03:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
intentions be heard and supported thank

um

03:39:43.070 --> 03:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:49.969 --> 03:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
the decision on the amendment which was
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
just adopted has been made and so that's
 
03:39:56.450 --> 03:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
a done deal but on the rest of the bill
 
03:39:59.809 --> 03:39:59.819 align:start position:0%
if I know that uh DHHS no longer
 
03:40:01.370 --> 03:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
believes that they have the authority to
 
03:40:01.380 --> 03:40:02.330 align:start position:0%
believes that they have the authority to
license

03:40:02.330 --> 03:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
um case management agencies for home and
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
community-based care and if I know that
 
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's critical to continue to license
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
these agencies in order to get Medicare
 
03:40:30.349 --> 03:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:30.359 --> 03:40:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
all right and if I know it's critical to
 
03:40:41.870 --> 03:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
continue to licensing these uh agencies
 
03:40:43.910 --> 03:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
in order to get the Medicare money to
 
03:40:45.250 --> 03:40:45.260 align:start position:0%
support people living in the community
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
rather than nursing home and to save the
 
03:40:49.790 --> 03:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
state money and if I believe that the
 
03:40:51.290 --> 03:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
other body will accept the language and
 
03:40:52.729 --> 03:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
the majority amendment that we have
 
03:40:52.739 --> 03:40:53.870 align:start position:0%
the majority amendment that we have
adopted

03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
03:40:55.849 --> 03:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
and it's likely to reject the language
 
03:40:57.349 --> 03:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
in the minority one which we're not
 
03:40:58.490 --> 03:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
coming to
 
03:41:02.510 --> 03:41:02.520 align:start position:0%

03:41:02.520 --> 03:41:03.830 align:start position:0%
but if I also know that um I really
don't

03:41:03.830 --> 03:41:03.840 align:start position:0%

minority of the committee have been

considered the same being unable to

following resolution resolved as in
 
03:48:02.750 --> 03:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative Matt's son of tasto for
 
03:48:07.969 --> 03:48:07.979 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee chair
 
03:48:10.130 --> 03:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative sanitasto for
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:48:18.830 --> 03:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this bill prohibits
 
03:48:21.110 --> 03:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
Telehealth services from out of state
 
03:48:22.790 --> 03:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
providers who are unlicensed in New
 
03:48:22.800 --> 03:48:23.689 align:start position:0%
providers who are unlicensed in New
Hampshire

03:48:23.689 --> 03:48:23.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:48:27.830 --> 03:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
while the bill allows for reciprocity I
 
03:48:29.870 --> 03:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
believe that many out-of-state providers
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
might not bother to comply with the with
 
03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
our bureaucracy because it's
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
unenforceable and because the New
 
03:48:37.969 --> 03:48:37.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Telehealth Market is Tiny
 
03:48:39.950 --> 03:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
compared to the global market it's
 
03:48:42.530 --> 03:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
unlike Licensing in the way electrician
 
03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
who moves here is bound to the New
 
03:48:47.750 --> 03:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Market a Telehealth provider
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
has access to the entire world and for
 
03:48:54.650 --> 03:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
the you know uh 1.4 million people here
 
03:48:57.309 --> 03:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
it may not be worth it for them to
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
comply with our rules
 
03:49:03.650 --> 03:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
um so either way this will increase
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
costs and reduce choice for Telehealth
 
03:49:07.729 --> 03:49:07.739 align:start position:0%
patients in New Hampshire so I ask you
 
03:49:10.729 --> 03:49:10.739 align:start position:0%
to vote no and uh Mr Speaker asked for a
 
03:49:13.969 --> 03:49:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:16.910 --> 03:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
do you remember yielded questions
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
I will yield for questions yes
 
03:49:20.929 --> 03:49:20.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
03:49:23.450 --> 03:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
representative I was a big supporter in
 
03:49:26.150 --> 03:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
Telehealth for veterans which is a
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
win-win for veterans moving into the
 
03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
state that we pass this legislation uh
 
03:49:34.490 --> 03:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
was cheaper they didn't have a
 
03:49:36.170 --> 03:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
Telehealth person
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
why would we not do it if we're doing it
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
for veterans who are successful why
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
would we not do it for the rest of the
 
03:49:45.290 --> 03:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't understand this uh Bill
 
03:49:51.050 --> 03:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
makes licensing required it prohibits uh
 
03:49:55.130 --> 03:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:57.410 --> 03:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
remember you'll do another question
 
03:49:59.170 --> 03:49:59.180 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I will wait for the question
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I might have
 
03:50:03.650 --> 03:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
missed interpreted if it just deals with
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
licensing I understand but you were
 
03:50:08.210 --> 03:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
asking a second question I I just want
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we are treating
 
03:50:11.689 --> 03:50:11.699 align:start position:0%
everyone else I mean I'm a veterans
 
03:50:13.729 --> 03:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
activist I just want to make sure the
 
03:50:16.010 --> 03:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
legislation treats everyone else the
 
03:50:17.689 --> 03:50:17.699 align:start position:0%
same when it comes to that Telehealth
 
03:50:20.330 --> 03:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
since it was a win-win would you agree
 
03:50:22.550 --> 03:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
for the veterans that's right
 
03:50:26.210 --> 03:50:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh I think you know that Telehealth
 
03:50:28.010 --> 03:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
service if somebody wants it veteran or
 
03:50:30.769 --> 03:50:30.779 align:start position:0%
not they should uh be able to you know
 
03:50:32.929 --> 03:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
take advantage of those services
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative for
 
03:50:42.410 --> 03:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh were you aware
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
that on a very similar Bill the
 
03:50:46.250 --> 03:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
licensing department of the State of New
 
03:50:50.330 --> 03:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh testified that around 44 of
 
03:50:52.490 --> 03:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents rely on out of
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
state Telehealth medical professionals
 
03:50:57.950 --> 03:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
for their therapy and if we were not to
 
03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
pass a bill like that we would be almost
 
03:51:04.490 --> 03:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
endangering half of the population and
 
03:51:07.250 --> 03:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
dropping their services
 
03:51:10.130 --> 03:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
uh yes I'm aware that many people in New
 
03:51:11.389 --> 03:51:11.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already use Telehealth
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
services and this could cut them off
 
03:51:18.290 --> 03:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:25.309 --> 03:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:28.130 --> 03:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:51:30.429 --> 03:51:30.439 align:start position:0%
I rise today in support of the strong
 
03:51:33.110 --> 03:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Edna recommendation of ought
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
why do we need to identify the site of
 
03:51:43.189 --> 03:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
service for Telehealth I agree entirely
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
with the representative who just asked
 
03:51:45.889 --> 03:51:45.899 align:start position:0%
the question we need to treat everyone
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
the same
 
03:51:50.809 --> 03:51:50.819 align:start position:0%
so long as Medical Care is delivered
 
03:51:54.410 --> 03:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
without incident everyone's happy
 
03:51:56.689 --> 03:51:56.699 align:start position:0%
and we really don't have to license
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
these people it doesn't actually matter
 
03:52:00.170 --> 03:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
the problem is this is the real world
 
03:52:04.729 --> 03:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:07.250 --> 03:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
this bill clarifies the site of service
 
03:52:09.170 --> 03:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
for medical services is the physical
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
location of the patient
 
03:52:13.610 --> 03:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
for 31 States this is already
 
03:52:17.450 --> 03:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
established law if you look at RSA 329c
 
03:52:20.030 --> 03:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
colon 1 you can read part of the
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
interstate medical licensure compact
 
03:52:23.929 --> 03:52:23.939 align:start position:0%
which we in several other states have
 
03:52:26.330 --> 03:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
adopted 31 States in total
 
03:52:29.210 --> 03:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
which states the compact also adopts the
 
03:52:32.030 --> 03:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
prevailing standard for licensor and
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
affirms that the practice of medicine
 
03:52:35.929 --> 03:52:35.939 align:start position:0%
occurs where the patient is located at
 
03:52:37.729 --> 03:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
the time of the physician patient
 
03:52:40.309 --> 03:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
encounter and therefore requires the
 
03:52:41.870 --> 03:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
physician to be under the jurisdiction
 
03:52:43.729 --> 03:52:43.739 align:start position:0%
of the State Medical Board where the
 
03:52:46.550 --> 03:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
patient is located
 
03:52:48.229 --> 03:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
similar Provisions are in other
 
03:52:51.110 --> 03:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts including the nurse
 
03:52:55.189 --> 03:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
licensure compact RSA 326b colon 46.
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
every nurse practicing in a party state
 
03:53:00.110 --> 03:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
must comply with the state practice laws
 
03:53:01.729 --> 03:53:01.739 align:start position:0%
of the state in which the patient is
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
located at the time care is rendered
 
03:53:07.070 --> 03:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill we will treat all
 
03:53:11.450 --> 03:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
50 states the same and not just 31.
 
03:53:13.729 --> 03:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
however not all States including the
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts
 
03:53:18.290 --> 03:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
have yet adopted the compact
 
03:53:20.689 --> 03:53:20.699 align:start position:0%
this is important especially when
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
complications ensue
 
03:53:24.889 --> 03:53:24.899 align:start position:0%
as without the site of service being
 
03:53:28.250 --> 03:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
defined it would be unclear which courts
 
03:53:30.410 --> 03:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
of resolved malpractice claims
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
or which governing boards would impose
 
03:53:34.849 --> 03:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
discipline when necessary
 
03:53:37.250 --> 03:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
if it's not clearly defined
 
03:53:40.250 --> 03:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
providers could be subject to Double
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy in some cases
 
03:53:46.849 --> 03:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
let me clarify with an example
 
03:53:50.210 --> 03:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
consider the case of an older man with
 
03:53:54.650 --> 03:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
he might consult with Dr Google
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
and get an inexpensive online
 
03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:06.290 --> 03:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
most of the time the pills come
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
they work well and when everything is
 
03:54:16.370 --> 03:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:18.349 --> 03:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
but one thing I learned in a long
 
03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
medical career
 
03:54:22.969 --> 03:54:22.979 align:start position:0%
is sometimes things do not go well
 
03:54:26.330 --> 03:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes they go very wrong
 
03:54:28.969 --> 03:54:28.979 align:start position:0%
both from the package insert and from
 
03:54:30.889 --> 03:54:30.899 align:start position:0%
personal experience taking care of
 
03:54:30.899 --> 03:54:32.150 align:start position:0%
personal experience taking care of
patients

03:54:32.150 --> 03:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
patients
 
03:54:35.630 --> 03:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
I know occasionally after Viagra a man
 
03:54:38.389 --> 03:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
suddenly and permanently goes
 
03:54:40.969 --> 03:54:40.979 align:start position:0%
permanently blind from non-arteritic
 
03:54:46.610 --> 03:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:49.610 --> 03:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
we call it niom
 
03:54:52.849 --> 03:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
the one patient I had with this was not
 
03:54:55.550 --> 03:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
a happy camper
 
03:54:58.309 --> 03:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
and bad results often result in
 
03:55:01.610 --> 03:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
but if we never defined what

jurisdictionless the site of service in

which courts would one Sue
 
03:55:12.650 --> 03:55:12.660 align:start position:0%

such as an excessive dose prescribed
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
after all if one is good isn't two

after all if one is good isn't two
better

03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:22.189 --> 03:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
which Board of Medicine would apply

unnecessary can of worms I ask you not
 
03:55:33.469 --> 03:55:33.479 align:start position:0%

incidents
 
03:57:46.849 --> 03:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
will only create a huge can of worms
 
03:57:49.309 --> 03:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
that will be very difficult to untangle
 
03:57:52.130 --> 03:57:52.140 align:start position:0%

as amended the chair recognizes
 
04:01:08.510 --> 04:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Allegro to speak against
 
04:01:16.370 --> 04:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
04:01:22.429 --> 04:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
04:01:25.550 --> 04:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
you'll hear the pros of it
 
04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
but there was also some distinctive
 
04:01:30.170 --> 04:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
committee minority opinions arguing
 
04:01:32.330 --> 04:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
against it and you won't hear those and
 
04:01:34.250 --> 04:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
that's why I've risen today to speak
 
04:01:38.950 --> 04:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
first is the idea in this and in other
 
04:01:41.990 --> 04:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts New Hampshire seeds
 
04:01:45.410 --> 04:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
its power to a board a board could be 10
 
04:01:48.170 --> 04:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
it could be 35 other states the bottom
 
04:01:50.570 --> 04:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
line is is that instead of having
 
04:01:55.010 --> 04:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
control over our own procedures we seed
 
04:01:57.410 --> 04:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
to other states
 
04:02:01.210 --> 04:02:01.220 align:start position:0%
now uh so it was brought up that simple
 
04:02:04.130 --> 04:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
much more simple reciprocity agreements
 
04:02:06.290 --> 04:02:06.300 align:start position:0%
would do better Justice to the state of
 
04:02:08.570 --> 04:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I agree with that argument
 
04:02:11.330 --> 04:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
and there's a second argument that goes
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
along those lines as well and that has
 
04:02:16.010 --> 04:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
to do with part one Article 28 of the
 
04:02:18.290 --> 04:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
State Constitution which says that the
 
04:02:20.510 --> 04:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
assessment of fees for instance fees
 
04:02:22.969 --> 04:02:22.979 align:start position:0%
well any charges right the state
 
04:02:25.910 --> 04:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
constitution discusses any charges uh
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
levied on the population but in this
 
04:02:31.010 --> 04:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
case it's fees on both compact member
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
states and on licensees uh part one
 
04:02:38.210 --> 04:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
Article 28 expressly prohibits charges
 
04:02:40.610 --> 04:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
without the consent of the people or the
 
04:02:43.370 --> 04:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
legislature so this bill not only seeds
 
04:02:46.849 --> 04:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
power to other states but it violates
 
04:02:50.090 --> 04:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
our own state constitution
 
04:02:52.910 --> 04:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
there's another point to be made
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
and it's not going to be a popular one
 
04:02:57.969 --> 04:02:57.979 align:start position:0%
to discuss but it's nevertheless true
 
04:03:00.530 --> 04:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
and I've laid down a marker for myself
 
04:03:02.650 --> 04:03:02.660 align:start position:0%
I'm laying it down for you here today
 
04:03:05.809 --> 04:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
even if you choose to not accept my
 
04:03:08.090 --> 04:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
opinion on this one I want you to think
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
about it in the future
 
04:03:12.650 --> 04:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
and that is that this bill also violates
 
04:03:14.990 --> 04:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
specifically in relation to uh divisive
 
04:03:20.750 --> 04:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
Concepts a bill that we just a language
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
that we just passed into law in the last
 
04:03:23.520 --> 04:03:24.889 align:start position:0%
that we just passed into law in the last
session

04:03:24.889 --> 04:03:24.899 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
what do I mean
 
04:03:28.370 --> 04:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
well I knew I'd get a few grumbles on
 
04:03:29.530 --> 04:03:29.540 align:start position:0%
this one
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
what do I mean
 
04:03:34.610 --> 04:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
well if you look at the requirements to
 
04:03:36.590 --> 04:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
enter the compact
 
04:03:38.570 --> 04:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
I forget which particular number it is
 
04:03:41.389 --> 04:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
but the training requirement insists
 
04:03:47.450 --> 04:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
that compact members licensees undergo
 
04:03:50.809 --> 04:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
social and cultural diversity training
 
04:03:50.819 --> 04:03:54.490 align:start position:0%
social and cultural diversity training
now

04:03:54.490 --> 04:03:54.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.429 --> 04:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
God I love that house will be in order
 
04:04:02.090 --> 04:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
now what is social and cultural
 
04:04:05.450 --> 04:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
diversity training well we know that
 
04:04:08.689 --> 04:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
under any other name it's still critical
 
04:04:10.729 --> 04:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
race Theory it's still a divisive
 
04:04:13.969 --> 04:04:13.979 align:start position:0%
concept also be in order
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.769 --> 04:04:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:24.050 --> 04:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
these abhorrent teachings
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
teaching racist teachings
 
04:04:29.689 --> 04:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
come under many names now ever since
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
across the country they were found out
 
04:04:37.250 --> 04:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
it's something of a chameleon right now
 
04:04:40.070 --> 04:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
it it's also known as
 
04:04:42.410 --> 04:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
um social and cultural diversity
 
04:04:42.420 --> 04:04:44.150 align:start position:0%
um social and cultural diversity
training

04:04:44.150 --> 04:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
training
 
04:04:48.110 --> 04:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning
 
04:04:51.530 --> 04:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
equity and inclusiveness training and if
 
04:04:54.410 --> 04:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
you don't believe that these are shifts
 
04:04:58.910 --> 04:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
of spots the member will suspend
 
04:05:00.769 --> 04:05:00.779 align:start position:0%
the point of order Mr Speaker this has
 
04:05:02.750 --> 04:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the bill
 
04:05:06.290 --> 04:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Speaker it does I just got through
 
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
saying that we're violating state law
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
specifically the language dealing with
 
04:05:13.250 --> 04:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
divisive Concepts I
 
04:05:13.260 --> 04:05:13.929 align:start position:0%
divisive Concepts I
I

04:05:13.929 --> 04:05:13.939 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:05:17.809 --> 04:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
have not read the bill so I'm not quite
 
04:05:19.969 --> 04:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
I think qualified to make a judgment one
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
way or the other but all I would suggest
 
04:05:22.439 --> 04:05:23.389 align:start position:0%
way or the other but all I would suggest
is

04:05:23.389 --> 04:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:05:24.889 --> 04:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
I'll try to get to the point a little
 
04:05:29.990 --> 04:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.710 --> 04:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
and it propagates divisive Concepts
 
04:05:39.889 --> 04:05:39.899 align:start position:0%
by forcing this is embedded in the bill
 
04:05:42.590 --> 04:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's embedded in the bill that this kind
 
04:05:44.929 --> 04:05:44.939 align:start position:0%
of training is required so again I'm
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
laying down the marker for myself I
 
04:05:46.800 --> 04:05:48.050 align:start position:0%
laying down the marker for myself I
cannot

04:05:48.050 --> 04:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
04:05:53.150 --> 04:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
and will not ever again vote for a bill
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
that places these kinds of requirements
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
upon licensees or upon State compacts
 
04:06:00.170 --> 04:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
I'm laying down the market for myself
 
04:06:02.330 --> 04:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
like I said
 
04:06:04.370 --> 04:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
under whatever name that's being passed
 
04:06:05.929 --> 04:06:05.939 align:start position:0%
off at the moment
 
04:06:07.729 --> 04:06:07.739 align:start position:0%
and I hope you'll join me by voting no
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
on this bill and its required teachings
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:27.050 --> 04:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
04:06:27.060 --> 04:06:30.410 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr speaker thank you
colleagues

04:06:30.410 --> 04:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:32.809 --> 04:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
04:06:35.689 --> 04:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
this is a bit of a heavy bill
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:43.610 --> 04:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:47.510 --> 04:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
modifies the original bill
 
04:06:51.170 --> 04:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:53.870 --> 04:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
what does some what this bill in its
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
is it primarily does two things and I'll
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
speak to it in two parts IT addresses
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
first off the mental health counseling
 
04:07:08.330 --> 04:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
compact New Hampshire is a small state
 
04:07:10.729 --> 04:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
we cannot be expected to have experts in
 
04:07:10.739 --> 04:07:11.990 align:start position:0%
we cannot be expected to have experts in
everything

04:07:11.990 --> 04:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
and certainly when it comes to mental
 
04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
health there are folks
 
04:07:18.170 --> 04:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
that need specific and targeted
 
04:07:18.180 --> 04:07:20.269 align:start position:0%
that need specific and targeted
treatment

04:07:20.269 --> 04:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:07:22.130 --> 04:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
so what this Mental Health compact does
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
is it opens up
 
04:07:26.570 --> 04:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's residents to that
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
specific and targeted treatment that
 
04:07:30.769 --> 04:07:30.779 align:start position:0%
they may need from someone say in
 
04:07:30.779 --> 04:07:32.450 align:start position:0%
they may need from someone say in
Wisconsin

04:07:32.450 --> 04:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin
 
04:07:35.030 --> 04:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
or Alabama
 
04:07:41.389 --> 04:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
as we're all very much aware
 
04:07:46.969 --> 04:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
the problems in the Mental Health
 
04:07:50.330 --> 04:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
Community have been exacerbated
 
04:07:52.849 --> 04:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
in the last five years over
 
04:07:55.790 --> 04:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
things that have occurred
 
04:07:58.910 --> 04:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
and the recognition of this problem
 
04:08:00.889 --> 04:08:00.899 align:start position:0%
has really come to the Forefront in a
 
04:08:01.510 --> 04:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
lot of areas
 
04:08:01.520 --> 04:08:06.170 align:start position:0%
lot of areas
[Music]

04:08:06.170 --> 04:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
first part of the bill does that's the
 
04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
Mental Health compact
 
04:08:13.130 --> 04:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
it is created in a standard form that is
 
04:08:15.590 --> 04:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
fairly similar to those of us that are
 
04:08:16.969 --> 04:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
04:08:22.429 --> 04:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:26.929 --> 04:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
the second part of my Amendment
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:36.290 --> 04:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
to what we do
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
with the placement of children
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment removed
 
04:08:44.269 --> 04:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
a provision to enter the state into a
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
mental or excuse me a child placement
 
04:08:46.199 --> 04:08:47.510 align:start position:0%
mental or excuse me a child placement
compact

04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
compact
 
04:08:50.149 --> 04:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
and we've removed it so I won't touch on
 
04:08:50.159 --> 04:08:51.110 align:start position:0%
and we've removed it so I won't touch on
it

04:08:51.110 --> 04:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:08:52.969 --> 04:08:52.979 align:start position:0%
but there are a couple of elements that
 
04:08:55.610 --> 04:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
are extraordinarily critical
 
04:08:57.950 --> 04:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
right now that were put into this
 
04:08:57.960 --> 04:08:59.630 align:start position:0%
right now that were put into this
amendment

04:08:59.630 --> 04:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:08:59.640 --> 04:09:02.090 align:start position:0%
amendment
that

04:09:02.090 --> 04:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:04.429 --> 04:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
in conversations with the folks at child
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
and family law have have expressed to me
 
04:09:09.889 --> 04:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
the absolute Paramount
 
04:09:12.110 --> 04:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
Paramount changes to what's going on we
 
04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
all have seen the news we all are aware
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
of the current problem that we have
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it's unfortunate that it takes an
 
04:09:23.210 --> 04:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
act in an event for us to make a change
 
04:09:25.250 --> 04:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
but sometimes that just that's just how
 
04:09:27.290 --> 04:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
it is we try to be proactive and we
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:33.769 --> 04:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
so this part the second part of what is
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
now Senate Bill 397
 
04:09:39.950 --> 04:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
I can I can in the utmost way urge you
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
to at least think about this part of it
 
04:09:45.110 --> 04:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
the Mental Health compact
 
04:09:47.689 --> 04:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
you may be familiar maybe not
 
04:09:50.269 --> 04:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
but this the second half of this that
 
04:09:50.279 --> 04:09:51.469 align:start position:0%
but this the second half of this that
involves

04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
involves
 
04:09:55.130 --> 04:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
an element in the current state compact
 
04:09:57.170 --> 04:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
for the place of of children that has
 
04:09:59.330 --> 04:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
been in utter utter failure for the
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire will be fixed
 
04:10:04.010 --> 04:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:10:07.370 --> 04:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
and I ask you to please support that
 
04:10:10.849 --> 04:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
a motion before us is the majority
 
04:10:14.929 --> 04:10:14.939 align:start position:0%
Committee reported want to pass as
 
04:10:17.809 --> 04:10:17.819 align:start position:0%
amended once
 
04:10:20.689 --> 04:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
Adam Silber requests a roll call is that
 
04:10:23.689 --> 04:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:25.969 --> 04:10:25.979 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
04:10:27.250 --> 04:10:27.260 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote
 
04:10:27.260 --> 04:11:23.389 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote
[Music]

04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:25.250 --> 04:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
the motion before it says ought to pass
 
04:11:30.410 --> 04:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:34.130 --> 04:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call vote
 
04:11:36.070 --> 04:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the representative
 
04:11:41.809 --> 04:11:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:43.490 --> 04:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
04:11:46.490 --> 04:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
if I knew that New Hampshire had a law
 
04:11:49.490 --> 04:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
against the propagation of divisive
 
04:11:49.500 --> 04:11:51.290 align:start position:0%
against the propagation of divisive
Concepts

04:11:51.290 --> 04:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
Concepts
 
04:11:57.410 --> 04:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
and if I knew that SB 397 required the
 
04:12:01.010 --> 04:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
teaching of precepts of critical race
 
04:12:05.689 --> 04:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
Theory would I then press the red button
 
04:12:07.370 --> 04:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative goalie
 
04:12:14.149 --> 04:12:14.159 align:start position:0%

speaker

04:12:15.649 --> 04:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
04:12:17.570 --> 04:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill will allow New
 
04:12:19.010 --> 04:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to enter into the mental
 
04:12:22.070 --> 04:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
health counseling Compact and Mr Speaker
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
if I know New Hampshire will be the 10th
 
04:12:25.790 --> 04:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
state to join and therefore will enact
 
04:12:27.410 --> 04:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
the compact
 
04:12:29.750 --> 04:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know this will
 
04:12:32.689 --> 04:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
increase access
 
04:12:35.689 --> 04:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
to mental health counseling

of experts in the prescription drug
 
04:15:05.389 --> 04:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
field recommends ways for the state to
 
04:15:07.250 --> 04:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
address the precipitous increase in
 
04:15:10.729 --> 04:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
prescription drug prices
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
the board is charged with collecting
 
04:15:14.330 --> 04:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
data and annually reporting its
 
04:15:16.670 --> 04:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the state this
 
04:15:18.349 --> 04:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
includes prescription drug spending
 
04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
targets strategies for optimization of
 
04:15:23.570 --> 04:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
affordability of prescription drugs the
 
04:15:24.769 --> 04:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
progress of implementing those
 
04:15:26.689 --> 04:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
recommendations and the annual net
 
04:15:28.910 --> 04:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
spending by public payers on
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
prescription pharmaceutical drugs the
 
04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
purpose of Senate Bill 450 is to make
 
04:15:34.969 --> 04:15:34.979 align:start position:0%
meaningful updates to ensure the board
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
can properly serve Granite Staters
 
04:15:39.290 --> 04:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
specifically this bill creates a
 
04:15:41.389 --> 04:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund to collect already
 
04:15:44.269 --> 04:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
established fees already established
 
04:15:47.149 --> 04:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
fees to pay the board's expenses makes
 
04:15:49.849 --> 04:15:49.859 align:start position:0%
it easier for a quorum to be formed and
 
04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
establishes the executive director's
 
04:15:54.769 --> 04:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
position as an unclassified position it
 
04:15:56.870 --> 04:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
also creates an appeals process for
 
04:15:59.030 --> 04:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
decisions made by the board this will
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
help strike a balance between the needs
 
04:16:02.689 --> 04:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
of patients and businesses while making
 
04:16:05.210 --> 04:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs more affordable a
 
04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
concern shared by 85 percent of granted
 
04:16:10.370 --> 04:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
Staters over the age of 45. some
 
04:16:12.170 --> 04:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
described drive this bill as the goal of
 
04:16:14.330 --> 04:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
one political party this couldn't be
 
04:16:16.070 --> 04:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
farther from the truth most the language
 
04:16:18.649 --> 04:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
currently in Senate Bill 450 was from a
 
04:16:20.450 --> 04:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
Republican's Amendment who presides on
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall behind me SB
 
04:16:26.210 --> 04:16:26.220 align:start position:0%
450 has co-sponsors from both parties
 
04:16:28.250 --> 04:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
when the prescription drug affordability
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
board was signed into law by Governor
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
Chris sununu on July 18 2020 he
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
described it as quote bipartisan
 
04:16:38.210 --> 04:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
legislation lowering prescription drug
 
04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
costs for granted Staters end quote he
 
04:16:42.290 --> 04:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
even took the time to go to the
 
04:16:44.750 --> 04:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee and speak in favor of the
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
legislation speak in favor of this board
 
04:16:50.769 --> 04:16:50.779 align:start position:0%
he showed this resounding report support
 
04:16:53.210 --> 04:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
in committee and has done so
 
04:16:56.210 --> 04:16:56.220 align:start position:0%
continuously since plus decreasing drug
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
prices has always been a bipartisan goal
 
04:17:00.170 --> 04:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
because it affects everyone no matter
 
04:17:02.750 --> 04:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
their party affiliation this nonpartisan
 
04:17:04.610 --> 04:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
board has been a great start to actually
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
creating real solutions to improve the
 
04:17:09.170 --> 04:17:09.180 align:start position:0%
lives of granite Staters and to make it
 
04:17:10.490 --> 04:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
so that they have more affordable drugs
 
04:17:12.830 --> 04:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
and actually introduced some free market
 
04:17:15.290 --> 04:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
reforms like getting drugs from Canada
 
04:17:17.210 --> 04:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature
 
04:17:18.649 --> 04:17:18.659 align:start position:0%
um heck I mean maybe the prescription
 
04:17:20.750 --> 04:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
affordability board will one day make
 
04:17:23.210 --> 04:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
Ivermectin more affordable for future
 
04:17:25.849 --> 04:17:25.859 align:start position:0%
prescription owners nonetheless I urge
 
04:17:27.649 --> 04:17:27.659 align:start position:0%
everyone to click the ruby red button
 
04:17:29.269 --> 04:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
and vote no on the committee's
 
04:17:31.490 --> 04:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation of interim study so a new
 
04:17:35.330 --> 04:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
motion can be brought forward thank you
 
04:17:37.309 --> 04:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Lee
 
04:17:39.110 --> 04:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
because we speak for the committee
 
04:17:39.120 --> 04:17:40.969 align:start position:0%
because we speak for the committee
report

04:17:40.969 --> 04:17:40.979 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:17:43.490 --> 04:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
earlier this year the house dealt with a
 
04:17:48.170 --> 04:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
related bill concerning the prescription
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board and voted to
 
04:17:52.729 --> 04:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
send it to interim study as we're asking
 
04:17:54.769 --> 04:17:54.779 align:start position:0%
for this bill the majority recommends
 
04:17:56.149 --> 04:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
the same for this bill for similar
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
reasons we would all like to see lower
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
prices for prescription drugs that goal
 
04:18:04.370 --> 04:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
is not the question the question is is
 
04:18:07.130 --> 04:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
this likely to achieve it
 
04:18:07.140 --> 04:18:08.809 align:start position:0%
this likely to achieve it
um

04:18:08.809 --> 04:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
the board and the expansion of the staff
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
that this bill in part provides for is
 
04:18:15.050 --> 04:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
unlikely to achieve that goal we heard a
 
04:18:16.670 --> 04:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony concerning the problems
 
04:18:18.590 --> 04:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
people had paying for prescriptions that
 
04:18:20.929 --> 04:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
they need I'm very sympathetic to those
 
04:18:23.870 --> 04:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
concerns the problem is is the board can
 
04:18:25.969 --> 04:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
only directly influence the cost that
 
04:18:28.370 --> 04:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
the state pays for drugs purchased for
 
04:18:30.170 --> 04:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
its employee health coverage
 
04:18:31.849 --> 04:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
and the biggest way it can influence
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
that is by prohibiting the state from
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing drugs if the suppliers won't
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
meet the price the board demands this
 
04:18:40.130 --> 04:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
could result in those in the health plan
 
04:18:42.590 --> 04:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
being denied access to drugs even if
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
their doctor believes they need them
 
04:18:46.610 --> 04:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
04:18:48.170 --> 04:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
Services has already gotten better
 
04:18:50.090 --> 04:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
prices for prescription drugs for the
 
04:18:52.309 --> 04:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
State Health Plan by putting them out to
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
Bid And by in some cases using reverse
 
04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
auctions to keep the cost down
 
04:18:58.610 --> 04:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
expanding this particular versus
 
04:19:00.590 --> 04:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
auctions in the future may be possible
 
04:19:03.530 --> 04:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
but may require some legislative changes
 
04:19:05.210 --> 04:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
and that can be considered for next year
 
04:19:08.809 --> 04:19:08.819 align:start position:0%
but there already have been benefits in
 
04:19:09.889 --> 04:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
this area
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
the bill would create a highly paid
 
04:19:14.090 --> 04:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
position of executive director make
 
04:19:15.769 --> 04:19:15.779 align:start position:0%
significant changes to fees and would
 
04:19:18.649 --> 04:19:18.659 align:start position:0%
establish a non-lapsing fund supporters
 
04:19:20.510 --> 04:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
described the executive director they
 
04:19:22.910 --> 04:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
would like to hire as a unicorn meaning
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
they would need a rare combination of
 
04:19:26.929 --> 04:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
skills and therefore a high salary would
 
04:19:29.090 --> 04:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
be required to attract them
 
04:19:31.070 --> 04:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
some of the changes to fees in this bill
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
are contradictory the board is given the
 
04:19:35.330 --> 04:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
power to Levy fees and the ability to
 
04:19:37.550 --> 04:19:37.560 align:start position:0%

complicated issue requires study by the
 
04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%

04:21:37.370 --> 04:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
for the efficient functioning of a board
 
04:21:43.729 --> 04:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
we created just two years ago and if I
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
know that that board is self-funded and
 
04:21:49.729 --> 04:21:49.739 align:start position:0%
creates zero expense for our state
 
04:21:52.130 --> 04:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that the bill
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
passed in the other body
 
04:21:58.370 --> 04:21:58.380 align:start position:0%

04:22:13.309 --> 04:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
would I not now push the red button so
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%

but if I also know that the prescription
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board is unlikely to
 
04:22:38.990 --> 04:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
do anything to low lower prescription

speaker if I know that in November of
2018

04:42:35.868 --> 04:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
2018
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
81 percent of New Hampshire voters added
 
04:42:41.810 --> 04:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
to our constitution a right to privacy
 
04:42:44.750 --> 04:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
an individual right to live free from
 
04:42:46.670 --> 04:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
government intrusion in private or
 
04:42:48.850 --> 04:42:48.860 align:start position:0%
personal information as being natural
 
04:42:51.410 --> 04:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent and that this
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
that this does not apply to New
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:00.948 --> 04:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
and if I know there is no caveat in
 
04:43:03.708 --> 04:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
Article 1 that says all men are born
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
equally free and independent except when
 
04:43:10.310 --> 04:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
pregnant and yet that loss of freedom
 
04:43:12.350 --> 04:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
and Independence is exactly what happens
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
resulting in reproductive servitude and
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
if I know women and men should both be
 
04:43:22.670 --> 04:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
free from government interference in
 
04:43:24.430 --> 04:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
their reproductive Health Care decisions
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire men having enjoyed a
 
04:43:30.050 --> 04:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
default of the government being hands
 
04:43:33.050 --> 04:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
off their choices for Generations
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know New
 
04:43:39.610 --> 04:43:39.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's citizens value our natural
 
04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
rights and it is unjust and undue a
 
04:43:46.310 --> 04:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
burden to restrict reproductive medical
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
decisions would I now press the green

a 17-4 strong bipartisan support

and passed this house on a Voice vote on
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
March 16th but the Senate has seen fit
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
to schedule for interim study it would
 
04:47:32.270 --> 04:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
attach that language
 
04:47:36.288 --> 04:47:36.298 align:start position:0%
to Senate Bill 227 just to refresh your
 
04:47:40.430 --> 04:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
memory all it does is it says if this if
 
04:47:43.810 --> 04:47:43.820 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement under state law
 
04:47:43.820 --> 04:47:45.470 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement under state law
ceases

04:47:45.470 --> 04:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
ceases
 
04:47:48.708 --> 04:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
property they cannot offer that to the
 
04:47:50.690 --> 04:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
to be forfeited
 
04:47:55.850 --> 04:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
under federal law that's all it says
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
it's just a it's a loophole
 
04:48:00.530 --> 04:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
for years we've been
 
04:48:03.770 --> 04:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
tightening our asset forfeiture laws and
 
04:48:06.410 --> 04:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
giving our citizens much better
 
04:48:08.448 --> 04:48:08.458 align:start position:0%
protection than what federal law offers
 
04:48:10.850 --> 04:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
and this is a little loophole and all
 
04:48:12.050 --> 04:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is close that
 
04:48:12.060 --> 04:48:13.730 align:start position:0%

loophole

speaker
 
04:54:20.930 --> 04:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
Ben thank you fellow members
 
04:54:24.110 --> 04:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 366 has the stated purpose
 
04:54:27.410 --> 04:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
of increasing both her confidence in the
 
04:54:30.050 --> 04:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
general election count by directing the
 
04:54:32.690 --> 04:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to audit
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
plus or minus one percent of the votes
 
04:54:37.970 --> 04:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
placed utilizing acrovoked machines in
 
04:54:40.430 --> 04:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
the primary and possibly the general
 
04:54:40.440 --> 04:54:41.690 align:start position:0%
the primary and possibly the general
election

04:54:41.690 --> 04:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
to accomplish this within the
 
04:54:46.190 --> 04:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
established parameters set it would
 
04:54:48.830 --> 04:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
require purchase of a high-speed counter
 
04:54:52.490 --> 04:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
by the state at a cost up to one hundred
 
04:54:54.110 --> 04:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
no I say possibly the general election
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
because the bill allows a secretary of
 
04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
state to forego
 
04:55:05.150 --> 04:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
account audit of the general election
 
04:55:07.670 --> 04:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
if he or she determines that there are
 
04:55:10.850 --> 04:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
unresolved issues with the process in
 
04:55:13.368 --> 04:55:13.378 align:start position:0%
the in the primary election audit
 
04:55:16.070 --> 04:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
so in other words we're being asked to
 
04:55:23.628 --> 04:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:25.128 --> 04:55:25.138 align:start position:0%
please take your
 
04:55:27.890 --> 04:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
take your shins outside the member has a
 
04:55:30.050 --> 04:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
right to be heard
 
04:55:32.208 --> 04:55:32.218 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam speaker too
 
04:55:33.650 --> 04:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
bad you're leaving this is exciting
 
04:55:33.660 --> 04:55:35.330 align:start position:0%
bad you're leaving this is exciting
stuff

04:55:35.330 --> 04:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
um and here's what the excitement is so
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
in other words we're being asked to
 
04:55:40.970 --> 04:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
appropriate a hundred thousand dollars
 
04:55:44.390 --> 04:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
to something we are not sure will work
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
again a hundred thousand dollars for
 
04:55:49.490 --> 04:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
something we will not we're not sure it
 
04:55:52.850 --> 04:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
will work as so stated in the bill now
 
04:55:54.530 --> 04:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
remember if you I heard a few times
 
04:55:57.470 --> 04:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
today that we were asked for a few
 
04:55:58.730 --> 04:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars for something
 
04:56:00.490 --> 04:56:00.500 align:start position:0%
that was determined maybe appropriate
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
worthwhile but the statement was we
 
04:56:05.208 --> 04:56:05.218 align:start position:0%
don't have the money
 
04:56:06.830 --> 04:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
well I just found a hundred thousand
 
04:56:08.810 --> 04:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
dollars for you I think
 
04:56:11.448 --> 04:56:11.458 align:start position:0%
um so as structured the other issue with
 
04:56:14.570 --> 04:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
it as structure the very small number of
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
machines that will be audited will do
 
04:56:21.590 --> 04:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
little to instill confidence in the
 
04:56:23.510 --> 04:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
voter count
 
04:56:26.570 --> 04:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
um again less than one percent of
 
04:56:29.810 --> 04:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
machines utilized will be audited at a
 
04:56:32.030 --> 04:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
cost of a hundred thousand dollars and
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
again we're not sure it will work or it
 
04:56:38.150 --> 04:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
will be adequate so for the reasons I
 
04:56:40.850 --> 04:56:40.860 align:start position:0%
stated in others I ask you this please
 
04:56:44.570 --> 04:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
vote no on the out to pass motion so
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we may bring forward another motion
 
04:56:49.610 --> 04:56:49.620 align:start position:0%

thank you madam speaker and members of
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
the house I rise on behalf of the
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
majority of the finance committee to
 
04:57:09.708 --> 04:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
support the motion of ought to pass on
 
04:57:11.530 --> 04:57:11.540 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
04:57:16.368 --> 04:57:16.378 align:start position:0%
366. in challenging times with various
 
04:57:18.650 --> 04:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
opinions and thoughts surrounding
 
04:57:21.670 --> 04:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
election integrity and voter confidence
 
04:57:25.570 --> 04:57:25.580 align:start position:0%
the house election law committee
 
04:57:28.090 --> 04:57:28.100 align:start position:0%
unanimously endorsed
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
as did this Full House on the consent
 
04:57:36.530 --> 04:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
calendar the idea of testing voting
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
machine accuracy this fall
 
04:57:44.270 --> 04:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
the bill authorizes the Secretary of
 
04:57:48.590 --> 04:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
State to audit all accu-vote devices in
 
04:57:49.730 --> 04:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
at least
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
two voting districts in the 2022 State
 
04:57:56.530 --> 04:57:56.540 align:start position:0%
primary election
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
Additionally the Secretary of State can
 
04:58:04.850 --> 04:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
then randomly audit accu-vote devices in
 
04:58:08.330 --> 04:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
not less than four voting districts in
 
04:58:12.650 --> 04:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
the 2022 general election unless
 
04:58:15.530 --> 04:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
foregone due to unresolved problems
 
04:58:18.170 --> 04:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
detected in the primary
 
04:58:22.250 --> 04:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
now to perform these audits the purchase
 
04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
of a high-speed scanner is required the
 
04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
scanner cost to the state is between 50
 
04:58:31.730 --> 04:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
to 100
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
000 and the majority of the finance
 
04:58:38.050 --> 04:58:38.060 align:start position:0%
committee found this expense reasonable
 
04:58:42.788 --> 04:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
to test machine accuracy and increase
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
more voter confidence this expense is
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
far from the phrase a waste of money
 
04:58:55.490 --> 04:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
please press the green button to ensure
 
04:59:00.288 --> 04:59:00.298 align:start position:0%
these audits take place this fall as the
 
04:59:03.050 --> 04:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
Full House intended them to on the
 
04:59:07.310 --> 04:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
consent calendar just last month thank
 
04:59:09.288 --> 04:59:09.298 align:start position:0%

04:59:20.448 --> 04:59:20.458 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:59:23.150 --> 04:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney would you believe
 
04:59:25.850 --> 04:59:25.860 align:start position:0%
that in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:59:28.128 --> 04:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
over three million dollars a year is
 
04:59:32.090 --> 04:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
spent on auditing our money on Bank
 
04:59:32.100 --> 04:59:33.470 align:start position:0%
spent on auditing our money on Bank
audits

04:59:33.470 --> 04:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
audits
 
04:59:36.948 --> 04:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
and would you also believe that in the
 
04:59:40.010 --> 04:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
course of the same year there's no
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
regular budgeted amount to audit our
 
04:59:42.958 --> 04:59:49.310 align:start position:0%
regular budgeted amount to audit our
votes

04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:51.410 --> 04:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I do
 
04:59:51.420 --> 04:59:55.510 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I do
believe

04:59:55.510 --> 04:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:58.250 --> 04:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative walls has requested a
 
05:00:00.288 --> 05:00:00.298 align:start position:0%
division vote members will take their
 
05:00:00.298 --> 05:00:06.288 align:start position:0%
division vote members will take their
seats

05:00:06.288 --> 05:00:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:06.298 --> 05:00:12.910 align:start position:0%
 
idea

05:00:12.910 --> 05:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:20.150 --> 05:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested is that
 
05:00:24.708 --> 05:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
05:00:27.050 --> 05:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
that is sufficiently second and members
 
05:01:07.610 --> 05:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:07.620 --> 05:01:16.810 align:start position:0%
 
space

05:01:16.810 --> 05:01:16.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:19.610 --> 05:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call Boat members
 
05:01:41.230 --> 05:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:48.948 --> 05:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:52.430 --> 05:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order
 
05:01:54.170 --> 05:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:01:56.570 --> 05:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
representative walls is recognized for a
 
05:01:59.750 --> 05:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:02.690 --> 05:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
if I know that there are 308 polling
 
05:02:10.010 --> 05:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
locations across New Hampshire and that
 
05:02:12.470 --> 05:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
auditing less than one percent of the
 
05:02:14.810 --> 05:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
machines used in an election is
 
05:02:17.628 --> 05:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
insufficient to find fraud or to enhance
 
05:02:19.730 --> 05:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
voter confidence
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
if I know that after every election
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
there are days of recounts that can find
 
05:02:29.270 --> 05:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
fraud if it exists but so far have
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
failed to find any fraud in voting
 
05:02:34.430 --> 05:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
machines or elsewhere
 
05:02:37.150 --> 05:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
if I know that these Scanning Machines
 
05:02:40.910 --> 05:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
cannot be used for any recode recounts
 
05:02:43.610 --> 05:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
for none of the recounts Because by
 
05:02:47.750 --> 05:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
Statute recounts must be done by hand
 
05:02:50.330 --> 05:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this came to the
 
05:02:52.730 --> 05:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
finance committee to determine whether
 
05:02:55.010 --> 05:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
this is a wise use of a hundred thousand
 
05:02:55.020 --> 05:02:55.970 align:start position:0%
this is a wise use of a hundred thousand
dollars

05:02:55.970 --> 05:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:02:58.368 --> 05:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
and if I know that a hundred thousand
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
dollars is a lot of money to spend on a
 
05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
machine that will be used only for six
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
audits every two years
 
05:03:10.128 --> 05:03:10.138 align:start position:0%
looking for fraud that has never been
 
05:03:11.930 --> 05:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
seen in New Hampshire
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:20.810 --> 05:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
then when I now press the red button so
 
05:03:22.910 --> 05:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
that an alternative motion can be made
 
05:03:24.890 --> 05:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:03:27.470 --> 05:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:03:27.480 --> 05:03:29.150 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
Griffin

05:03:29.150 --> 05:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
Griffin
 
05:03:31.970 --> 05:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
her parliamentary inquiry thank you
 
05:03:35.150 --> 05:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
madam speaker if I know that performing
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
checks on election results is crucial to
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
having confidence in our election
 
05:03:43.250 --> 05:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
results and this process was already
 
05:03:45.590 --> 05:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
approved by this body
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this in a previous
 
05:03:53.628 --> 05:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
session we have now in statute a statute
 
05:03:56.270 --> 05:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
authorizing the testing of high-speed
 
05:03:58.310 --> 05:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
scanners to explore the auditing of
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
election results and that testing has
 
05:04:04.430 --> 05:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
occurred successfully so we know it will
 
05:04:06.170 --> 05:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
work and the scanners will be available
 
05:04:10.430 --> 05:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
for future use and if I know that this
 
05:04:14.090 --> 05:04:14.100 align:start position:0%
process steps sets in place the next
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
steps for performing audits on elections
 
05:04:19.730 --> 05:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
by directing the Secretary of State to
 
05:04:21.890 --> 05:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
test the voting machine accuracy for
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
elections this year and in September in
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
November something our constituents want
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
and we can use for future legislation
 
05:04:34.550 --> 05:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
would I now press the green button to
 
05:04:36.770 --> 05:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
support the unanimous recommendations of
 
05:04:39.410 --> 05:04:39.420 align:start position:0%

the amendment to Senate Bill 381 was
 
05:09:45.170 --> 05:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
likely developed to separate out the

quite a bit of testimony regarding the

and appropriate health care and
 
05:10:07.250 --> 05:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
education is already under the oversight
 
05:10:09.948 --> 05:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
of the child Advocates office
 
05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
there was considerable discussion about
 
05:10:15.190 --> 05:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
adding Personnel to that office
 
05:10:17.690 --> 05:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
specifically designated to handle
 
05:10:21.288 --> 05:10:21.298 align:start position:0%
Special Education cases Personnel who
 
05:10:24.650 --> 05:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
could execute the charges put forth by
 
05:10:27.948 --> 05:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 381 and do it at a
 
05:10:31.128 --> 05:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced cost
 
05:10:34.730 --> 05:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
but rather than amending SB 381 to
 
05:10:37.430 --> 05:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
develop a special education Advocate
 
05:10:40.250 --> 05:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
position within the office of the child

1857 H seeks to remove the authority of

the child advocate
 
05:10:53.030 --> 05:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
to have access to any educational

records at all
 
05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment would strike the word
 
05:11:02.448 --> 05:11:02.458 align:start position:0%
education from RSA 21v
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
in both the job description and the
 
05:11:09.288 --> 05:11:09.298 align:start position:0%
section granting access to records and
 
05:11:11.930 --> 05:11:11.940 align:start position:0%

advocate
 
05:11:16.250 --> 05:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
there's a large oversight in this
 
05:11:16.260 --> 05:11:17.690 align:start position:0%
there's a large oversight in this
amendment

05:11:17.690 --> 05:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 381 attempts to create an
 
05:11:23.690 --> 05:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
advocate's position for children with
 
05:11:23.700 --> 05:11:25.490 align:start position:0%
advocate's position for children with
disabilities

05:11:25.490 --> 05:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
05:11:28.128 --> 05:11:28.138 align:start position:0%
students specifically mentioned within
 
05:11:31.550 --> 05:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
the bill only include those who receive
 
05:11:34.910 --> 05:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
special education services via an
 
05:11:37.550 --> 05:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
individualized education program or a
 
05:11:40.610 --> 05:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
Section 504 plan
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
children without disabilities are not
 
05:11:43.680 --> 05:11:45.590 align:start position:0%
children without disabilities are not
covered

05:11:45.590 --> 05:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
covered
 
05:11:48.050 --> 05:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
so what happens if the office of the
 
05:11:50.868 --> 05:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
child advocate is investigating a case
 
05:11:54.288 --> 05:11:54.298 align:start position:0%
that involves a child who does not have
 
05:11:56.330 --> 05:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
a disability
 
05:12:00.410 --> 05:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
what if dcyf has custody or the Juvenile
 
05:12:02.690 --> 05:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
Justice System
 
05:12:05.510 --> 05:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
if this amendment passes the child
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
advocate's office would have no access
 
05:12:11.628 --> 05:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
to Student Records to school Personnel
 
05:12:15.890 --> 05:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
to evaluations reports or any other
 
05:12:18.890 --> 05:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
information currently considered part of
 
05:12:22.010 --> 05:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
their right to an education
 
05:12:25.070 --> 05:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
how then is the adequate and appropriate
 
05:12:28.788 --> 05:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
education being guaranteed
 
05:12:32.090 --> 05:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
this oversight is huge
 
05:12:36.050 --> 05:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
including educational access
 
05:12:40.550 --> 05:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
to the child to RSA 21v was most
 
05:12:44.208 --> 05:12:44.218 align:start position:0%
definitely intentional when it happened
 
05:12:47.270 --> 05:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
removing it would be a colossal
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
that could tie the hands of the very
 
05:12:55.670 --> 05:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
people we count on to protect our most
 
05:12:58.670 --> 05:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerable kids and leave those kids
 
05:13:01.730 --> 05:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
standing In Harm's Way
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
who is their advocate
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
please vote no on the amendment by

thank you madam speaker
 
05:13:22.208 --> 05:13:22.218 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes an independent
 
05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
independent Office of the advocate for
 
05:13:27.890 --> 05:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
special education
 
05:13:30.650 --> 05:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
the minority believes that this the
 
05:13:33.230 --> 05:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
functions in this bill should instead be
 
05:13:35.270 --> 05:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
placed on the current office of child
 
05:13:35.280 --> 05:13:36.650 align:start position:0%
placed on the current office of child
advocate

05:13:36.650 --> 05:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
05:13:39.050 --> 05:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
the office of child advocate director
 
05:13:41.690 --> 05:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
came before us and said that they have
 
05:13:43.730 --> 05:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
authority over the Department of
 
05:13:43.740 --> 05:13:44.930 align:start position:0%
authority over the Department of
Education

05:13:44.930 --> 05:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
Education
 
05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
funny I thought the governor did but
 
05:13:49.010 --> 05:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
that's just me
 
05:13:53.330 --> 05:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
um the debatable point here is whether
 
05:13:54.770 --> 05:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
they have authority over the Department
 
05:13:59.510 --> 05:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:00.530 --> 05:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
the debatable point is here is whether
 
05:14:07.610 --> 05:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
they have authority over the Department
 
05:14:10.390 --> 05:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
05:14:14.050 --> 05:14:14.060 align:start position:0%
the statute covering the child advocate
 
05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
mentions State departments state
 
05:14:20.030 --> 05:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
government departments but
 
05:14:20.040 --> 05:14:21.708 align:start position:0%
government departments but
specifies

05:14:21.708 --> 05:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
specifies
 
05:14:24.230 --> 05:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
05:14:26.510 --> 05:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
nothing else
 
05:14:29.868 --> 05:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
the RSA also defines child as someone
 
05:14:34.310 --> 05:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
quote in the custody of or receiving
 
05:14:37.750 --> 05:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
services from Health and Human Services
 
05:14:41.448 --> 05:14:41.458 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with kids in public
 
05:14:45.050 --> 05:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
education or children with special needs
 
05:14:47.930 --> 05:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
certainly nothing in the statute gives
 
05:14:51.470 --> 05:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
them authority over local public school
 
05:14:54.170 --> 05:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
districts and that is where special
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
education services are provided
 
05:15:00.050 --> 05:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has told us they
 
05:15:02.990 --> 05:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
have no involvement in Direct Services
 
05:15:05.270 --> 05:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
to children
 
05:15:07.628 --> 05:15:07.638 align:start position:0%
the statute for the child advocate deals
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
specifically with dcyf and Juvenile
 
05:15:14.810 --> 05:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
Justice it would be a horrible mistake
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
to combine that with special education
 
05:15:21.550 --> 05:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
05:15:25.368 --> 05:15:25.378 align:start position:0%
clarifies and puts in unequivocable
 
05:15:28.368 --> 05:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
terms that the office of child advocate
 
05:15:31.788 --> 05:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
has no role in education or special
 
05:15:34.910 --> 05:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
education complaints by removing only
 
05:15:38.208 --> 05:15:38.218 align:start position:0%
two references to education in the child
 
05:15:40.550 --> 05:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
advocate statute
 
05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
two references that's it
 
05:15:46.070 --> 05:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
please support the co the finance

05:15:50.690 --> 05:15:50.700 align:start position:0%
reason for not passing this important

05:16:00.948 --> 05:16:00.958 align:start position:0%
the question is on the amendment number

Education that are caused by this
 
05:17:31.250 --> 05:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
amendment is critical

to the services offered by the office of
 
05:17:37.610 --> 05:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
the child advocate and if I know that
 
05:17:40.128 --> 05:17:40.138 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate is the
 
05:17:43.128 --> 05:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
current agency mandated to provide
 
05:17:46.250 --> 05:17:46.260 align:start position:0%

05:17:57.948 --> 05:17:57.958 align:start position:0%
for our most vulnerable children
 
05:18:00.770 --> 05:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
it's education is critical to the
 
05:18:03.530 --> 05:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the office to be able
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%

05:18:15.110 --> 05:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
funding for the office of child advocate
 
05:18:18.590 --> 05:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
will fund staff and resources resulting

in services for that best interest and

improve advocacy for families dealing
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
with special ed issues would I now vote
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
to defeat this amendment so that added
 
05:18:32.930 --> 05:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
funding can go to the present office of
 
05:18:35.570 --> 05:18:35.580 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Madam speaker

ladies gentlemen like many of you here
 
05:21:54.650 --> 05:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
in this room I do a lot of motorcycle
 
05:21:57.590 --> 05:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
riding I've ridden in 48 of the 50
 
05:22:00.170 --> 05:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
states and I make annual soldiers to New

Hampshire to California
 
05:22:03.410 --> 05:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
but I do get lost
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
more often than I like to admit but
 
05:22:07.548 --> 05:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
that's part of the adventure actually
 
05:22:09.890 --> 05:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
it's more frustrating than Adventure
 
05:22:12.230 --> 05:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
I was told several years ago you should
 
05:22:14.448 --> 05:22:14.458 align:start position:0%
get rid of that flip phone and get an
 
05:22:14.458 --> 05:22:15.350 align:start position:0%

iPhone

05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%

05:22:20.150 --> 05:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
you directions show you where you are
 
05:22:22.730 --> 05:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
talk you through the root sounded like
 
05:22:25.250 --> 05:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
an easy solution just go
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
to the store get a new phone so I did
 
05:22:29.990 --> 05:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
with a little training I learned how to
 
05:22:32.510 --> 05:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
program an app on my cell phone I felt
 
05:22:34.548 --> 05:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
great no more frustration of getting
 
05:22:36.948 --> 05:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
lost missing exits going in the wrong
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
direction you get my point
 
05:22:42.230 --> 05:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
problem solved I'm a happy guy
 
05:22:44.990 --> 05:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
frustrations and anger subsided and then
 
05:22:46.510 --> 05:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
about the memories
 
05:22:48.650 --> 05:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
can I ask you what this has to do with
 
05:22:50.750 --> 05:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
the bill in one paragraph you will I'll
 
05:22:52.190 --> 05:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
be right there I'm getting there okay
 
05:22:54.470 --> 05:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
trying to make some context here
 
05:22:56.270 --> 05:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
then we also get confused thank you
 
05:22:58.670 --> 05:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
he'll get there okay
 
05:23:01.250 --> 05:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'm a happy guy frustrations in Anger
 
05:23:03.708 --> 05:23:03.718 align:start position:0%
have survived and then about three hours
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
into the trip the map app had used all
 
05:23:08.628 --> 05:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
the battery life and I was now without a
 
05:23:10.610 --> 05:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
cell phone emergency access the
 
05:23:13.190 --> 05:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
directions now I was really ticked off
 
05:23:14.930 --> 05:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
actually I felt worse than I did before
 
05:23:17.208 --> 05:23:17.218 align:start position:0%
I ever started using the phone I should
 
05:23:18.890 --> 05:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
have known there was a catch
 
05:23:20.990 --> 05:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
come to find out this One-Stop solution
 
05:23:22.850 --> 05:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
cost me more money than I wanted to
 
05:23:25.128 --> 05:23:25.138 align:start position:0%
spend really only scratched the surface
 
05:23:27.170 --> 05:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
of my problems and made me feel better
 
05:23:29.270 --> 05:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
but only for a short time
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
I was right back to where I started
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
angry all over again and more frustrated
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
a waste of time effort and money
 
05:23:39.410 --> 05:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
I just felt like I want a never-ending
 
05:23:41.868 --> 05:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
convey about going round and round
 
05:23:44.270 --> 05:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
fast forward to 2020.
 
05:23:46.788 --> 05:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
just last week actually I'm still
 
05:23:48.470 --> 05:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
battling the same old problem of
 
05:23:50.690 --> 05:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
inaccurate directions missed exits wrong
 
05:23:52.548 --> 05:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
turns and lost
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
this members that will suspend stay your
 
05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative boycott can you step back
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
no no no don't walk in front I don't
 
05:24:14.150 --> 05:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:16.368 --> 05:24:16.378 align:start position:0%
Madam speaker this has little to do with
 
05:24:18.170 --> 05:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
the bill and even though there was
 
05:24:19.788 --> 05:24:19.798 align:start position:0%
conversation about this just a couple of
 
05:24:23.208 --> 05:24:23.218 align:start position:0%
minutes ago it seems to be going on
 
05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
your point is well taken and I trust the
 
05:24:29.628 --> 05:24:29.638 align:start position:0%
speaker has finished that paragraph
 
05:24:31.548 --> 05:24:31.558 align:start position:0%
yes I am now Madam speaker absolutely
 
05:24:34.250 --> 05:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:24:36.530 --> 05:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
so I'll pass I'll go past Tuesday
 
05:24:38.930 --> 05:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
afternoon it was a disaster anyhow
 
05:24:41.810 --> 05:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
my friends the story is true even the
 
05:24:43.788 --> 05:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
part you didn't hear and it does
 
05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually relate to SB 381 because the
 
05:24:49.970 --> 05:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
proposal of an independent Advocate and
 
05:24:52.610 --> 05:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
I quote directly from the bill serves as
 
05:24:55.310 --> 05:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
a resource for information ensures all
 
05:24:58.128 --> 05:24:58.138 align:start position:0%

documents has access to IAP 504s and
 
05:25:04.430 --> 05:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
shoes proper documentation tracks
 
05:25:06.288 --> 05:25:06.298 align:start position:0%
metrics disagreements complaints of
 
05:25:08.628 --> 05:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
parents and caretakers implements and
 
05:25:11.448 --> 05:25:11.458 align:start position:0%
measures and tracks and gives parents
 
05:25:12.890 --> 05:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
the insurance that five days in advance
 
05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%

05:25:16.610 --> 05:25:16.620 align:start position:0%

House the president of the Senate
Etc

05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
05:25:26.208 --> 05:25:26.218 align:start position:0%
nowhere in this bill
 
05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
portion is designed to connect nowhere
 
05:25:30.948 --> 05:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
in the bill is an independent Advocate
 
05:25:34.310 --> 05:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
given legal authority to change anything
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
imagine that you are an angry parent of
 
05:25:38.868 --> 05:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
a special ed student you have in your
 
05:25:40.850 --> 05:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
mind the belief that the school is not
 
05:25:43.128 --> 05:25:43.138 align:start position:0%
meeting your child's educational needs
 
05:25:45.410 --> 05:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
you've had a meeting after meeting with
 
05:25:47.448 --> 05:25:47.458 align:start position:0%
teachers and guidance counselors sped
 
05:25:49.548 --> 05:25:49.558 align:start position:0%
administrators you've gone over the IEP
 
05:25:52.490 --> 05:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
you've modified the IOP you bet over
 
05:25:54.708 --> 05:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
backwards to get help from the school
 
05:25:56.750 --> 05:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
district your child and still no success
 
05:25:59.090 --> 05:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed
 
05:26:00.708 --> 05:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
then you hear about this new position
 
05:26:03.170 --> 05:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
sort of like a new cell phone a new
 
05:26:06.048 --> 05:26:06.058 align:start position:0%
Office Independent Advocate who is not
 
05:26:07.850 --> 05:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
connected to the school or to the State
 
05:26:10.250 --> 05:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
education department and their role is
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
to serve as the point of contact for you
 
05:26:15.230 --> 05:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
finally you think the solution is close
 
05:26:16.850 --> 05:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
at hand
 
05:26:19.070 --> 05:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
you meet The Advocate and one of the
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
assistants and you go through your
 
05:26:22.490 --> 05:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
entire Litany of years of disappointment
 
05:26:24.230 --> 05:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
with the school lack of services
 
05:26:26.270 --> 05:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
insufficient time too much paperwork

with little or no resolve you are
 
05:26:32.208 --> 05:26:32.218 align:start position:0%

asking for for way too long no no no
 
05:26:45.650 --> 05:26:45.660 align:start position:0%
the independent Advocate who is not
 
05:26:47.150 --> 05:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
connected with the school district or
 
05:26:50.810 --> 05:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
the state doe has no power or authority
 
05:26:54.530 --> 05:26:54.540 align:start position:0%

05:27:06.170 --> 05:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
this new unnecessary five hundred
 
05:27:09.770 --> 05:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar office cannot solve the
 
05:27:12.288 --> 05:27:12.298 align:start position:0%
parents problem the parent has month
 
05:27:15.948 --> 05:27:15.958 align:start position:0%
once again met with the system's failure
 
05:27:18.830 --> 05:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
this is not a win for the parent or the
 
05:27:18.840 --> 05:27:19.850 align:start position:0%
this is not a win for the parent or the
child

05:27:19.850 --> 05:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:27:22.910 --> 05:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
this feel-good option may sound good and
 
05:27:24.590 --> 05:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
terrific and look good but it doesn't
 
05:27:26.810 --> 05:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
get the job done it doesn't even pass
 
05:27:28.490 --> 05:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
the smell test
 
05:27:30.350 --> 05:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
I understand the intent of the bill
 
05:27:32.270 --> 05:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
parents need options
 
05:27:34.730 --> 05:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
the voices need to be heard and there
 
05:27:36.288 --> 05:27:36.298 align:start position:0%
has to be a map to get them in the right
 
05:27:36.298 --> 05:27:37.368 align:start position:0%
has to be a map to get them in the right
exit

05:27:37.368 --> 05:27:37.378 align:start position:0%
exit
 
05:27:39.948 --> 05:27:39.958 align:start position:0%
in this case the directions are clear
 
05:27:42.650 --> 05:27:42.660 align:start position:0%
the root is already set and the phone is
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
charged the doe within their current
 
05:27:49.368 --> 05:27:49.378 align:start position:0%
special ed options already has the
 
05:27:51.948 --> 05:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
process for parents to be hurried the
 
05:27:54.890 --> 05:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
doe already has individuals assigned to
 
05:27:57.530 --> 05:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
help parents with child IEPs and will
 
05:28:00.350 --> 05:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
serve as their Advocates the doe already
 
05:28:02.448 --> 05:28:02.458 align:start position:0%
has a process in place and an
 
05:28:04.490 --> 05:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
independent investigator to review
 
05:28:06.230 --> 05:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
complaints from parents for lack of
 
05:28:08.930 --> 05:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
service of the child and it has the
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
legal authority to direct action to
 
05:28:13.730 --> 05:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
correct inequities and violations of law
 
05:28:17.030 --> 05:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
the doe already has a due process
 
05:28:19.010 --> 05:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
hearing program and many other services
 
05:28:20.990 --> 05:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
for parents
 
05:28:23.090 --> 05:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
all these services and programmatic
 
05:28:25.190 --> 05:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
options that a parent needs to have and
 
05:28:27.230 --> 05:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
they're concerned examined are already
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
in place they are already connected to
 
05:28:30.770 --> 05:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
the DOE
 
05:28:32.690 --> 05:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
the answer to reducing the parent
 
05:28:34.910 --> 05:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
frustration and proving the piles
 
05:28:37.850 --> 05:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
options is not accompanied by creating
 
05:28:40.430 --> 05:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
another level of costly ineffective
 
05:28:43.310 --> 05:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
powerless reporting writing bureaucracy
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
but rather perhaps a simple plan as
 
05:28:49.548 --> 05:28:49.558 align:start position:0%
training by Doe to have their programs
 
05:28:51.650 --> 05:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
better understood and more easily
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
accessible by parents
 
05:28:57.048 --> 05:28:57.058 align:start position:0%
please vote right on SB 381 it was not
 
05:28:58.548 --> 05:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
just the money that would be one thing
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
but the Bill's problems were far beyond
 
05:29:03.530 --> 05:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
the dollar signs thank you madam speaker
 
05:29:05.930 --> 05:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the member from
 
05:29:08.150 --> 05:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro representative cordelli to
 
05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of the report
 
05:29:13.010 --> 05:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker and I will talk
 
05:29:14.390 --> 05:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
about the bill
 
05:29:17.090 --> 05:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes an independent
 
05:29:19.548 --> 05:29:19.558 align:start position:0%
office of advocate for special education
 
05:29:21.788 --> 05:29:21.798 align:start position:0%
and as we said before
 
05:29:25.970 --> 05:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
independent is the key this office and
 
05:29:27.770 --> 05:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
the director will not be linked to any
 
05:29:29.628 --> 05:29:29.638 align:start position:0%
local school district or the Department
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
of Education and that's important
 
05:29:34.548 --> 05:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
they will have the responsibility to
 
05:29:36.650 --> 05:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
take complaints from parents and to
 
05:29:38.570 --> 05:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
investigate those compare those
 
05:29:41.448 --> 05:29:41.458 align:start position:0%
complaints and put pressure on districts
 
05:29:43.610 --> 05:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
when necessary they'll be able to
 
05:29:46.190 --> 05:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
examine IEP records track meeting
 
05:29:49.190 --> 05:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
results and even have parents complete
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
evaluation reports on their IEP meetings
 
05:29:55.850 --> 05:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
this office will annually report back to
 
05:29:58.368 --> 05:29:58.378 align:start position:0%
us on their findings
 
05:30:01.070 --> 05:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
as a result of a study committee last
 
05:30:01.080 --> 05:30:02.530 align:start position:0%
as a result of a study committee last
fall

05:30:02.530 --> 05:30:02.540 align:start position:0%
fall
 
05:30:05.690 --> 05:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
this bill grew out of discussions after
 
05:30:07.448 --> 05:30:07.458 align:start position:0%
the study committee
 
05:30:10.610 --> 05:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
also another outcome is that there will
 
05:30:13.190 --> 05:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
be a performance audit done on special
 
05:30:17.390 --> 05:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
education at the Department of Education
 
05:30:22.250 --> 05:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
the Senate passed SB 381 on the consent
 
05:30:25.190 --> 05:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
calendar with leadership of both parties
 
05:30:27.410 --> 05:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
as co-sponsors
 
05:30:30.830 --> 05:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately it's not a bipartisan
 
05:30:35.868 --> 05:30:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:38.208 --> 05:30:38.218 align:start position:0%
the director
 
05:30:41.090 --> 05:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
of the current office
 
05:30:43.310 --> 05:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
said that they were not prepared to deal
 
05:30:46.070 --> 05:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
with special education and that is a
 
05:30:49.610 --> 05:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
reason that you helped us in passing the
 
05:30:51.230 --> 05:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
amendment just now the committee
 
05:30:51.240 --> 05:30:53.990 align:start position:0%
amendment just now the committee
Amendment

05:30:53.990 --> 05:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:56.810 --> 05:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard from the special
 
05:30:59.470 --> 05:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
education administrators Association
 
05:31:01.970 --> 05:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
stated that there is no evidence that
 
05:31:03.890 --> 05:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
the process is flawed
 
05:31:06.470 --> 05:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
well tell that to parents
 
05:31:09.288 --> 05:31:09.298 align:start position:0%
a survey of parents last spring showed
 
05:31:11.628 --> 05:31:11.638 align:start position:0%
that 30 percent of parents of children
 
05:31:14.208 --> 05:31:14.218 align:start position:0%
with disabilities felt that they were
 
05:31:16.368 --> 05:31:16.378 align:start position:0%
not an equal partner in determining the
 
05:31:18.890 --> 05:31:18.900 align:start position:0%
services that their child would receive
 
05:31:21.650 --> 05:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
40 percent indicated that they were
 
05:31:24.110 --> 05:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
never asked about if the services were
 
05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
meeting their child's needs
 
05:31:29.390 --> 05:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
we heard the argument that there was a
 
05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
cost to this new office and that is
 
05:31:33.170 --> 05:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
growing government
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively small small cost but
 
05:31:38.868 --> 05:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
what about the human cost
 
05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
what about future government costs when
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
these children cannot get the services
 
05:31:47.448 --> 05:31:47.458 align:start position:0%
they need and become adults depending on
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
Government Services rather independent
 
05:31:54.048 --> 05:31:54.058 align:start position:0%
adults out in the community
 
05:31:56.208 --> 05:31:56.218 align:start position:0%
I wish you could have been there to hear
 
05:31:59.150 --> 05:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
the hearings we had and heard from the
 
05:32:02.030 --> 05:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
parents parents in tears
 
05:32:04.190 --> 05:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
stories from parents who have had to
 
05:32:06.708 --> 05:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
take out second mortgages
 
05:32:09.288 --> 05:32:09.298 align:start position:0%
parents who have gone bankrupt trying to
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
get services for their child all while
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get a free free public
 
05:32:17.868 --> 05:32:17.878 align:start position:0%
education for their child
 
05:32:20.650 --> 05:32:20.660 align:start position:0%
stories of pressure intimidation
 
05:32:24.048 --> 05:32:24.058 align:start position:0%
retaliation yes retaliation for trying
 
05:32:25.850 --> 05:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
to get help for their children
 
05:32:28.010 --> 05:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
we even had testimony from one parent
 
05:32:30.590 --> 05:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
who went to court for protection from
 
05:32:30.600 --> 05:32:31.788 align:start position:0%
who went to court for protection from
threats

05:32:31.788 --> 05:32:31.798 align:start position:0%
threats
 
05:32:33.970 --> 05:32:33.980 align:start position:0%
we heard from parents who are lawyers
 
05:32:37.310 --> 05:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
parents who are former State reps former
 
05:32:38.990 --> 05:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
state senators
 
05:32:40.850 --> 05:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
yet the Department of Education will
 
05:32:42.770 --> 05:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
tell you that they only get about 30
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
complaints a year
 
05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
well maybe there's a reason they only
 
05:32:49.970 --> 05:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
get 30 complaints a year
 
05:32:52.490 --> 05:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
for way too many parents the system is
 
05:32:56.090 --> 05:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
broken that is why we need the office of
 
05:32:58.730 --> 05:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
advocate for special education why they
 
05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
need this office
 
05:33:03.170 --> 05:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
I think our new guiding principle for
 
05:33:07.548 --> 05:33:07.558 align:start position:0%
Education should be be bold be impatient
 
05:33:10.190 --> 05:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
impatient yes our children are only
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
young once
 
05:33:14.150 --> 05:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
parents especially those in special
 
05:33:16.430 --> 05:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
education have been patient for way too
 
05:33:16.440 --> 05:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
education have been patient for way too
long

05:33:17.590 --> 05:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
long
 
05:33:17.600 --> 05:33:19.490 align:start position:0%
long
impatient

05:33:19.490 --> 05:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
impatient
 
05:33:23.048 --> 05:33:23.058 align:start position:0%
patient for improvements patient for new
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
parent manuals parent training
 
05:33:29.090 --> 05:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
parents are tired of waiting when their
 
05:33:32.030 --> 05:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
child's future is at stake parents will
 
05:33:34.548 --> 05:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
no longer wait to be listened to they
 
05:33:37.850 --> 05:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
will no longer be wait to be patient and
 
05:33:39.288 --> 05:33:39.298 align:start position:0%
neither should we
 
05:33:41.628 --> 05:33:41.638 align:start position:0%
that patient ends now
 
05:33:43.788 --> 05:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
give these kids a chance

thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:41:40.970 --> 05:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
this floor Amendment passed this body as
 
05:41:44.930 --> 05:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
HP 1337 just a little while ago
 
05:41:47.930 --> 05:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
with near unanimous support from our
 
05:41:50.330 --> 05:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
Republican caucus only three were
 
05:41:50.340 --> 05:41:52.490 align:start position:0%
Republican caucus only three were
against

05:41:52.490 --> 05:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
against
 
05:41:54.590 --> 05:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment would index the number of
 
05:41:56.208 --> 05:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
weeks an individual could collect
 
05:41:58.250 --> 05:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation to the current
 
05:42:01.128 --> 05:42:01.138 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate in New Hampshire
 
05:42:04.128 --> 05:42:04.138 align:start position:0%
the maximum number of weeks would remain
 
05:42:07.970 --> 05:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
at 26 which is what it is today
 
05:42:11.090 --> 05:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
many states have already adopted similar
 
05:42:12.590 --> 05:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and the results are
 
05:42:15.288 --> 05:42:15.298 align:start position:0%
Universal businesses the ones who fund
 
05:42:18.470 --> 05:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
our Unemployment Insurance Fund see a
 
05:42:20.810 --> 05:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
reduction in the employees unemployment
 
05:42:22.730 --> 05:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
insurance tax rate
 
05:42:25.368 --> 05:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
and the unemployed individuals look for
 
05:42:28.128 --> 05:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
and go back to work more quickly
 
05:42:30.470 --> 05:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
the legislation also contains language
 
05:42:32.750 --> 05:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
that would allow the governor in times
 
05:42:34.910 --> 05:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
of emergency like we witnessed in the
 
05:42:38.628 --> 05:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
2008 financial crisis and the recent
 
05:42:42.948 --> 05:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
covet epidemic to override this RSA
 
05:42:45.288 --> 05:42:45.298 align:start position:0%
I ask that you press the green button to
 
05:42:47.390 --> 05:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
support the motion of ought to pass
 
05:42:50.150 --> 05:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:43:00.530 --> 05:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:06.048 --> 05:43:06.058 align:start position:0%
I rise in opposition to Amendment 1927 h
 
05:43:08.930 --> 05:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
as it was stated this amendment is the
 
05:43:12.048 --> 05:43:12.058 align:start position:0%
former HB 1337.
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
that bill and this Amendment provide a
 
05:43:16.490 --> 05:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
solution to a problem that does not
 
05:43:16.500 --> 05:43:18.350 align:start position:0%
solution to a problem that does not
exist

05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
exist
 
05:43:20.930 --> 05:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
this amendment reduces the unemployment
 
05:43:24.350 --> 05:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
payment duration during times of low
 
05:43:24.360 --> 05:43:26.628 align:start position:0%
payment duration during times of low
unemployment

05:43:26.628 --> 05:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
05:43:28.610 --> 05:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
he will be argued or it has been argued
 
05:43:30.770 --> 05:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
that this limitation will provide an
 
05:43:33.048 --> 05:43:33.058 align:start position:0%
incentive for unemployed workers to get
 
05:43:34.730 --> 05:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
back to work
 
05:43:36.830 --> 05:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
sounds reasonable however
 
05:43:39.230 --> 05:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
as I already stated
 
05:43:42.048 --> 05:43:42.058 align:start position:0%
this incentive is not needed
 
05:43:44.628 --> 05:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor Deputy
 
05:43:46.788 --> 05:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
Commissioner testified that New
 
05:43:48.650 --> 05:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has lower unemployment
 
05:43:53.208 --> 05:43:53.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:55.850 --> 05:43:55.860 align:start position:0%
this meager unemployment payment level
 
05:43:58.368 --> 05:43:58.378 align:start position:0%
is incentive enough for people to get
 
05:44:00.650 --> 05:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
back to work
 
05:44:02.690 --> 05:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
as soon as they can
 
05:44:04.970 --> 05:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
this the Deputy Commissioner further
 
05:44:04.980 --> 05:44:06.948 align:start position:0%
this the Deputy Commissioner further
testified

05:44:06.948 --> 05:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
testified
 
05:44:09.530 --> 05:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
that indeed very few people take the
 
05:44:13.010 --> 05:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:15.230 --> 05:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
so what harm will do will it do to
 
05:44:17.330 --> 05:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
reduce the duration of benefits
 
05:44:19.548 --> 05:44:19.558 align:start position:0%
actually this amendment will do real
 
05:44:22.610 --> 05:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
harm to some of the unemployed people
 
05:44:25.430 --> 05:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
if a person has physical limitations
 
05:44:28.128 --> 05:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
extraordinary family obligations or
 
05:44:30.890 --> 05:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
other different life circumstances
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
the full 26 weeks of benefit may be
 
05:44:33.840 --> 05:44:35.030 align:start position:0%
the full 26 weeks of benefit may be
needed

05:44:35.030 --> 05:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
needed
 
05:44:38.448 --> 05:44:38.458 align:start position:0%
because of these life circumstances and
 
05:44:41.090 --> 05:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
it would make it very difficult to find
 
05:44:43.490 --> 05:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
a new job
 
05:44:46.368 --> 05:44:46.378 align:start position:0%
this is all in independent and separate
 
05:44:49.310 --> 05:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
from the unemployment rate
 
05:44:51.708 --> 05:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
this unnecessary incentive should be
 
05:44:53.930 --> 05:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
rejected to avoid the hardship it will
 
05:44:56.628 --> 05:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
cause to a small number of unemployed
 
05:44:58.430 --> 05:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire workers
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
please press the red button to reject
 
05:45:04.430 --> 05:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
this unnecessary Amendment and Mr
 
05:45:09.770 --> 05:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:11.750 --> 05:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
05:45:13.548 --> 05:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
take your seats
 
05:45:13.558 --> 05:45:14.628 align:start position:0%
take your seats
well

05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:45:16.730 --> 05:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
roll call has been requested by
 
05:45:18.110 --> 05:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative Noonan is that
 
05:45:20.510 --> 05:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
05:45:22.670 --> 05:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
05:46:42.890 --> 05:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:45.530 --> 05:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the turcotte
 
05:46:46.850 --> 05:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment
 
05:46:50.208 --> 05:46:50.218 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call vote
 
05:46:52.430 --> 05:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
Jay I recognizes representative Osborne
 
05:46:55.788 --> 05:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary inquiry
 
05:46:58.730 --> 05:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker so if I know that
 
05:47:01.010 --> 05:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
tying the length of unemployment
 
05:47:04.190 --> 05:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
benefits to the rate of unemployment has
 
05:47:05.868 --> 05:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
been done in other states and is a
 
05:47:07.750 --> 05:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
common sense way of reducing
 
05:47:10.368 --> 05:47:10.378 align:start position:0%
unemployment taxes paid by businesses
 
05:47:13.250 --> 05:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
and incentivizing workers to get back
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
into the workforce where they are
 
05:47:17.110 --> 05:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
desperately needed and I know that this
 
05:47:19.548 --> 05:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
language and this amendment has already
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
passed this body decisively a number of
 
05:47:24.590 --> 05:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
weeks ago would I now press the green
 
05:47:28.788 --> 05:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
button and reaffirm the house position
 
05:47:30.708 --> 05:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Sullivan
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:47:40.070 --> 05:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
if I know that other states that may
 
05:47:42.830 --> 05:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
have adopted this provision have
 
05:47:44.750 --> 05:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
substantially higher unemployment
 
05:47:46.510 --> 05:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
payment levels New Hampshire does
 
05:47:50.628 --> 05:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
therefore might need a greater incentive
 
05:47:53.590 --> 05:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this
 
05:47:56.570 --> 05:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment for that reason is entirely
 
05:47:56.580 --> 05:47:58.368 align:start position:0%
Amendment for that reason is entirely
unnecessary

05:47:58.368 --> 05:47:58.378 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
05:48:01.250 --> 05:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that this
 
05:48:01.260 --> 05:48:02.330 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that this
amendment

05:48:02.330 --> 05:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:48:04.490 --> 05:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
if it becomes law
 
05:48:07.310 --> 05:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
will do real harm to the small number of
 
05:48:10.670 --> 05:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
unemployed people who truly depend on 26
 
05:48:12.350 --> 05:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
weeks of unemployment because of
 
05:48:14.750 --> 05:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
difficulties that they have in finding
 
05:48:16.128 --> 05:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
new employment
 
05:48:18.048 --> 05:48:18.058 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker would I then press the red
 
05:48:20.510 --> 05:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
button to defeat this amendment thank
 
05:48:23.510 --> 05:48:23.520 align:start position:0%

05:50:18.170 --> 05:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
I have a problem with Senate Bill 401
 
05:50:20.090 --> 05:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
and let me I've already told you guys
 
05:50:22.310 --> 05:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
what it was and I didn't do very well
 
05:50:24.048 --> 05:50:24.058 align:start position:0%
last time
 
05:50:26.090 --> 05:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping my vote will
 
05:50:28.788 --> 05:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
be a little better this time
 
05:50:31.970 --> 05:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
why I don't like this one car in Senate
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 401
 
05:50:38.030 --> 05:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
is the dot dash cams
 
05:50:41.510 --> 05:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
I understand the theory behind it
 
05:50:44.390 --> 05:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I support it
 
05:50:46.430 --> 05:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
but the dash cam
 
05:50:50.990 --> 05:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
video will be stored for three days
 
05:50:54.890 --> 05:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.048 --> 05:50:57.058 align:start position:0%
it is to be deleted
 
05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
so when I asked the question in the
 
05:51:00.890 --> 05:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
committee I said so can somebody come in
 
05:51:02.628 --> 05:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
in that three days and grab that video
 
05:51:05.390 --> 05:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
and store it on their little thumb drive
 
05:51:07.250 --> 05:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
and the guy goes well absolutely they
 
05:51:07.260 --> 05:51:08.690 align:start position:0%
and the guy goes well absolutely they
can

05:51:08.690 --> 05:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:51:10.128 --> 05:51:10.138 align:start position:0%
and then he says we can use it for
 
05:51:11.868 --> 05:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
training or anything else we want to use
 
05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
it for
 
05:51:18.110 --> 05:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:21.170 --> 05:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
I was happy to hear today when my
 
05:51:24.650 --> 05:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
friend from stratum got up here
 
05:51:28.070 --> 05:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
and she spoke about that Constitutional
 
05:51:30.890 --> 05:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment that we passed
 
05:51:33.470 --> 05:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
the one where passed overwhelmingly in
 
05:51:35.810 --> 05:51:35.820 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire saying that
 
05:51:38.448 --> 05:51:38.458 align:start position:0%
we want to be private
 
05:51:41.208 --> 05:51:41.218 align:start position:0%
in our lives
 
05:51:43.970 --> 05:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
and sadly Mr Speaker this one part of
 
05:51:48.170 --> 05:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:51.470 --> 05:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
so Mr Speaker lastly
 
05:51:54.110 --> 05:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
05:51:58.548 --> 05:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
401 has a lot of taxes in it
 
05:52:01.070 --> 05:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker
 
05:52:04.368 --> 05:52:04.378 align:start position:0%
taxation is theft
 
05:52:08.868 --> 05:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:12.350 --> 05:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:16.250 --> 05:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative umberger
 
05:52:26.150 --> 05:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:31.910 --> 05:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:38.270 --> 05:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
SP 401 touches every single community in
 
05:52:40.730 --> 05:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
our state
 
05:52:44.330 --> 05:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
it provides money for Bridges and for
 
05:52:44.340 --> 05:52:47.330 align:start position:0%
it provides money for Bridges and for
roads

05:52:47.330 --> 05:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:47.340 --> 05:52:49.310 align:start position:0%
 
36

05:52:49.310 --> 05:52:49.320 align:start position:0%

05:52:49.320 --> 05:52:51.048 align:start position:0%

million

05:52:51.048 --> 05:52:51.058 align:start position:0%
million
 
05:52:54.350 --> 05:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
no that's the wrong number 66 million
 
05:52:54.360 --> 05:52:56.750 align:start position:0%
no that's the wrong number 66 million
dollars

05:52:56.750 --> 05:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:01.070 --> 05:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of cash to go towards roads
 
05:53:02.868 --> 05:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
and bridges
 
05:53:05.390 --> 05:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
this money is
 
05:53:05.400 --> 05:53:05.930 align:start position:0%
this money is
um

05:53:05.930 --> 05:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:08.990 --> 05:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
not being raised through taxes
 
05:53:10.970 --> 05:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure where that came
 
05:53:10.980 --> 05:53:11.930 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure where that came
from

05:53:11.930 --> 05:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:53:15.590 --> 05:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:19.368 --> 05:53:19.378 align:start position:0%
when we first got the bill
 
05:53:23.690 --> 05:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
it said that all the money for that was
 
05:53:26.270 --> 05:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
allocated for Bridges
 
05:53:29.990 --> 05:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
had to go to red listed Bridges
 
05:53:33.948 --> 05:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
well that was kind of an ugly thing
 
05:53:37.670 --> 05:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
because every Community would have to
 
05:53:40.670 --> 05:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
raise 20 percent match
 
05:53:44.150 --> 05:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
in order to get any of this bridge money
 
05:53:47.930 --> 05:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
and we thought that was a really bad
 
05:53:47.940 --> 05:53:50.448 align:start position:0%
and we thought that was a really bad
idea

05:53:50.448 --> 05:53:50.458 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:53:52.670 --> 05:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
especially since
 
05:53:56.170 --> 05:53:56.180 align:start position:0%
through the infrastructure program
 
05:54:01.070 --> 05:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
dot is going to have lots of
 
05:54:05.208 --> 05:54:05.218 align:start position:0%
red listed Bridge money to hand out but
 
05:54:08.868 --> 05:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
we wanted all the bridges in the
 
05:54:11.448 --> 05:54:11.458 align:start position:0%
community whether they were red listed
 
05:54:14.570 --> 05:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
or just had huge potholes
 
05:54:22.070 --> 05:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:25.070 --> 05:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
also there are dollars that will be
 
05:54:27.230 --> 05:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
going out for
 
05:54:27.240 --> 05:54:28.730 align:start position:0%
going out for
um

05:54:28.730 --> 05:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:31.010 --> 05:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
body cameras
 
05:54:36.350 --> 05:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
for uh we have a a program already for
 
05:54:41.150 --> 05:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh body cameras for our local police and
 
05:54:45.048 --> 05:54:45.058 align:start position:0%
we will be adding money to that
 
05:54:47.750 --> 05:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
now I realize
 
05:54:50.750 --> 05:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
that there is some concern
 
05:54:53.930 --> 05:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
about the dash cameras
 
05:54:59.570 --> 05:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:01.430 --> 05:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
when they when
 
05:55:05.690 --> 05:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
when dot came to talk to us about this
 
05:55:09.350 --> 05:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
they brought us several pictures
 
05:55:09.360 --> 05:55:11.390 align:start position:0%
they brought us several pictures
where

05:55:11.390 --> 05:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:55:11.400 --> 05:55:13.490 align:start position:0%
where
motorists

05:55:13.490 --> 05:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
motorists
 
05:55:18.830 --> 05:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
have smashed into their vehicles
 
05:55:22.730 --> 05:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
and the problem is that sometimes it's
 
05:55:24.830 --> 05:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
only a side swipe
 
05:55:29.390 --> 05:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
and the car is not disabled or the truck
 
05:55:33.788 --> 05:55:33.798 align:start position:0%
and so this car or truck just goes
 
05:55:36.650 --> 05:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
Merrily on its way
 
05:55:38.750 --> 05:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
and we
 
05:55:43.010 --> 05:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers get stuck with repairing
 
05:55:46.670 --> 05:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
that particular vehicle
 
05:55:49.730 --> 05:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
I think we all maybe had seen the other
 
05:55:52.910 --> 05:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
night where a uh a Volkswagen ran into
 
05:55:54.948 --> 05:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
the back of a
 
05:55:56.810 --> 05:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
of a truck
 
05:55:59.930 --> 05:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
and fortunately
 
05:56:03.708 --> 05:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
that vehicle didn't go any place after
 
05:56:04.970 --> 05:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
it hit
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
because it was really smashed
 
05:56:07.680 --> 05:56:09.410 align:start position:0%
because it was really smashed
but

05:56:09.410 --> 05:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:56:13.250 --> 05:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
I can assure you from the people that I
 
05:56:14.448 --> 05:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
05:56:17.930 --> 05:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
that this information is going to be
 
05:56:17.940 --> 05:56:19.190 align:start position:0%
that this information is going to be
used

05:56:19.190 --> 05:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
used
 
05:56:23.030 --> 05:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
in order to find the offenders
 
05:56:26.048 --> 05:56:26.058 align:start position:0%
that have run into
 
05:56:30.530 --> 05:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
dots vehicles and that's its major major
 
05:56:30.540 --> 05:56:32.150 align:start position:0%
dots vehicles and that's its major major
purpose

05:56:32.150 --> 05:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
05:56:36.350 --> 05:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
yes we can all have theories about
 
05:56:40.730 --> 05:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
the Goblins coming in and getting the
 
05:56:44.690 --> 05:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
getting the downloads but
 
05:56:48.350 --> 05:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
please I think we can trust
 
05:56:52.490 --> 05:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
our state workers not to allow that to
 
05:56:52.500 --> 05:56:53.330 align:start position:0%
our state workers not to allow that to
happen

05:56:53.330 --> 05:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:56:58.070 --> 05:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
so I thank you and um bridge and Road
 
05:57:03.830 --> 05:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:06.288 --> 05:57:06.298 align:start position:0%
motion before us is ought to pass as
 
05:57:10.490 --> 05:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
amended on Senate bill 401.
 
05:57:13.368 --> 05:57:13.378 align:start position:0%

05:57:21.288 --> 05:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and the committee

05:57:48.830 --> 05:57:48.840 align:start position:0%

therefore consider the same report the

same with the recommendation that the

05:59:03.170 --> 05:59:03.180 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:59:41.270 --> 05:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
I Rise to speak against the floor
 
05:59:44.208 --> 05:59:44.218 align:start position:0%
amendment to SB 407.
 
05:59:47.990 --> 05:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
it inserts language from hb1210 into an
 
05:59:49.788 --> 05:59:49.798 align:start position:0%
important bill which extends the
 
05:59:52.190 --> 05:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60
 
05:59:54.708 --> 05:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
days to 12 months for a small group of
 
05:59:57.650 --> 05:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
mothers on Medicaid who earn between 138
 
06:00:00.230 --> 06:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
and 196 percent of the federal poverty
 
06:00:00.240 --> 06:00:02.330 align:start position:0%
and 196 percent of the federal poverty
level

06:00:02.330 --> 06:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
level
 
06:00:06.708 --> 06:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
the amendment allows exemptions
 
06:00:10.730 --> 06:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
from any employer mandate for any
 
06:00:14.208 --> 06:00:14.218 align:start position:0%
vaccine instituted by any private or
 
06:00:17.090 --> 06:00:17.100 align:start position:0%
public employer who receives any federal
 
06:00:19.788 --> 06:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
or state funds on the basis of a medical
 
06:00:19.798 --> 06:00:21.288 align:start position:0%
or state funds on the basis of a medical
exemption

06:00:21.288 --> 06:00:21.298 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
06:00:23.570 --> 06:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
without any documentation
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
a religious exemption without any
 
06:00:26.760 --> 06:00:28.490 align:start position:0%
a religious exemption without any
documentation

06:00:28.490 --> 06:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
06:00:31.548 --> 06:00:31.558 align:start position:0%
or explanation or a simple conscientious
 
06:00:31.558 --> 06:00:32.930 align:start position:0%
or explanation or a simple conscientious
objection

06:00:32.930 --> 06:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
objection
 
06:00:36.948 --> 06:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
this makes any mandate useless
 
06:00:38.628 --> 06:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
there are several problems with this
 
06:00:40.490 --> 06:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
amendment first the amendment tells
 
06:00:42.530 --> 06:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
businesses how to run their businesses
 
06:00:44.810 --> 06:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
not good
 
06:00:47.390 --> 06:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
secondly the amendment is in conflict
 
06:00:50.750 --> 06:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
with the rules promulgated by CMS with
 
06:00:53.150 --> 06:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
regard to covid-19 vaccination mandate
 
06:00:56.208 --> 06:00:56.218 align:start position:0%
which requires documentation of the
 
06:00:58.788 --> 06:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
medical reason for the medical exemption
 
06:01:01.570 --> 06:01:01.580 align:start position:0%
signed by a licensed practitioner
 
06:01:05.270 --> 06:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
documentation of religious exemptions
 
06:01:07.250 --> 06:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
and it does not
 
06:01:10.368 --> 06:01:10.378 align:start position:0%
allow conscientious objection as an
 
06:01:12.770 --> 06:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
exemption this will place our facilities
 
06:01:15.590 --> 06:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
out of compliance with CMS
 
06:01:17.930 --> 06:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
and it'll be therefore at risk of civil
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
penalties loss of reimbursement for
 
06:01:22.190 --> 06:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid patients and
 
06:01:24.470 --> 06:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately termination from Medicare and
 
06:01:27.170 --> 06:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
Medicaid participation
 
06:01:29.270 --> 06:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
and I need to remind you that Medicaid
 
06:01:31.070 --> 06:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
pays the bill for two-thirds of our
 
06:01:32.750 --> 06:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
nursing home residents
 
06:01:35.030 --> 06:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and your
 
06:01:37.070 --> 06:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
county delegations would then need to
 
06:01:39.470 --> 06:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
backfill that Revenue loss in order to
 
06:01:42.288 --> 06:01:42.298 align:start position:0%
keep these facilities open and that's
 
06:01:44.390 --> 06:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
starting with just that 200 million
 
06:01:46.250 --> 06:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
dollars which is the federal share of
 
06:01:48.708 --> 06:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funding for long-term care in
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire alone and it's like real
 
06:01:52.788 --> 06:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
money this is going to raise the
 
06:01:55.910 --> 06:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
property taxes in all of our counties
 
06:01:58.368 --> 06:01:58.378 align:start position:0%
and the cost will be vastly more when
 
06:02:00.410 --> 06:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
the Medicare reimbursement for hospital
 
06:02:03.890 --> 06:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
care is also included
 
06:02:06.170 --> 06:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
some have claimed that CMS will not stop
 
06:02:08.208 --> 06:02:08.218 align:start position:0%
reimbursement as it has not happened in
 
06:02:11.330 --> 06:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
other states that have placed similar
 
06:02:13.430 --> 06:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
laws in place but that's not a guarantee
 
06:02:14.930 --> 06:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
the mandate's relatively new and
 
06:02:16.548 --> 06:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions are only commencing
 
06:02:19.670 --> 06:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
now and CMS has already sanctioned the
 
06:02:22.910 --> 06:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
state of Kansas for a similar bill
 
06:02:25.310 --> 06:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court ruling on January
 
06:02:30.350 --> 06:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
13 of 2022 upheld the CMS mandate
 
06:02:32.590 --> 06:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
for vaccination of health care workers
 
06:02:35.090 --> 06:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
staying the lower court injunction in
 
06:02:36.708 --> 06:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
the text of the Supreme Court decision
 
06:02:39.590 --> 06:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that if the lower court
 
06:02:41.690 --> 06:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
decision ultimately makes it to the
 
06:02:43.788 --> 06:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court on appeal that they will
 
06:02:45.650 --> 06:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
uphold the mandate
 
06:02:46.970 --> 06:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
and to date
 
06:02:48.770 --> 06:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
no appeal of the lower court injunction
 
06:02:50.810 --> 06:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
has been filed
 
06:02:53.690 --> 06:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
the point is that vaccine mandates in a
 
06:02:56.570 --> 06:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
health care setting is crucial
 
06:02:58.850 --> 06:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
since hospitals and long-term care
 
06:03:00.948 --> 06:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
facilities care for vulnerable
 
06:03:03.650 --> 06:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
individuals they must do everything they
 
06:03:06.708 --> 06:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
can to maintain safety that includes a
 
06:03:09.650 --> 06:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of a patient
 
06:03:12.948 --> 06:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
or a resident to not face unnecessary
 
06:03:15.530 --> 06:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
exposure to an infectious disease from
 
06:03:17.270 --> 06:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
the health care worker caring for them
 
06:03:19.850 --> 06:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
and remember this isn't just about covid
 
06:03:22.788 --> 06:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
this is for any vaccination whether it
 
06:03:25.850 --> 06:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
be flu or anything
 
06:03:28.490 --> 06:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
this bill then this actually brings us
 
06:03:31.250 --> 06:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
to one more problem this bill is coached
 
06:03:33.170 --> 06:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
as protecting your Liberty but it's
 
06:03:35.570 --> 06:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
actually against Liberty
 
06:03:38.110 --> 06:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
and this was just pointed out very well
 
06:03:41.350 --> 06:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
just last week in an article about
 
06:03:45.530 --> 06:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
hb1210 by Andrew Klein of the Josiah
 
06:03:49.190 --> 06:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
Bartlett Center for Public Policy not
 
06:03:52.910 --> 06:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
exactly a left-wing organization
 
06:03:56.208 --> 06:03:56.218 align:start position:0%
Klein wrote quote vaccination status is
 
06:03:58.610 --> 06:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
not an immutable characteristic like
 
06:04:01.970 --> 06:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
race or sex it is a choice
 
06:04:06.170 --> 06:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
and not a purely individualistic one
 
06:04:08.510 --> 06:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
it can have profound even life or death
 
06:04:11.810 --> 06:04:11.820 align:start position:0%
consequences for others
 
06:04:14.030 --> 06:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
framed as a defense of individual
 
06:04:16.970 --> 06:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
liberty the bill would actually reduce
 
06:04:20.868 --> 06:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
Liberty if enacted it would weaken the
 
06:04:23.570 --> 06:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
right of free individuals to associate
 
06:04:26.690 --> 06:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
only with others who accept their
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
dedication to fighting infectious
 
06:04:32.208 --> 06:04:32.218 align:start position:0%
diseases through vaccination
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
06:04:36.048 --> 06:04:36.058 align:start position:0%
Klein points out that people have a
 
06:04:37.548 --> 06:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
right to associate with others who
 
06:04:40.548 --> 06:04:40.558 align:start position:0%
choose to vaccinate this amendment will
 
06:04:43.548 --> 06:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
violate that right of Association
 
06:04:45.890 --> 06:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
here's a real world example let's say
 
06:04:47.810 --> 06:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
Your mother wishes to be placed in a
 
06:04:50.030 --> 06:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
nursing home or she chooses a nursing
 
06:04:52.490 --> 06:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
home in which vaccinations are mandated
 
06:04:54.530 --> 06:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
for her safety
 
06:04:58.548 --> 06:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
that is her right of Association
 
06:05:00.410 --> 06:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
she may have chosen that nursing home
 
06:05:02.270 --> 06:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
for that very reason
 
06:05:05.090 --> 06:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
but if this amendment becomes law
 
06:05:08.090 --> 06:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
her right of Association is violated
 
06:05:11.810 --> 06:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
and her bodily Integrity may be violated
 
06:05:14.510 --> 06:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
by a virus that she does not wish to be
 
06:05:17.390 --> 06:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
violated by
 
06:05:19.730 --> 06:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
so protect your mother
 
06:05:23.330 --> 06:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
protect our businesses and protect our
 
06:05:26.270 --> 06:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid funding by
 
06:05:28.788 --> 06:05:28.798 align:start position:0%

house will be in order
 
06:07:19.910 --> 06:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the turkot floor
 
06:07:22.910 --> 06:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment this is a roll call vote chair
 
06:07:24.650 --> 06:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Osborne for
 
06:07:26.930 --> 06:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
06:07:29.510 --> 06:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
06:07:31.250 --> 06:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
language in this amendment uh has
 
06:07:33.830 --> 06:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
already passed this house once before a
 
06:07:36.470 --> 06:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago if I know that no employer
 
06:07:39.048 --> 06:07:39.058 align:start position:0%
should be required to threaten their
 
06:07:42.288 --> 06:07:42.298 align:start position:0%
employees jobs over uh Federal mandates
 
06:07:44.990 --> 06:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
and if I know no employee should have to
 
06:07:47.150 --> 06:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
choose between their employment and a
 
06:07:48.708 --> 06:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
forced penetration
 
06:07:52.010 --> 06:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
would I now press the green button and
 
06:07:58.490 --> 06:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:05.448 --> 06:08:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:07.670 --> 06:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's hard to follow
 
06:08:07.680 --> 06:08:09.490 align:start position:0%
that's hard to follow
but

06:08:09.490 --> 06:08:09.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:08:13.070 --> 06:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this has
 
06:08:16.128 --> 06:08:16.138 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with forcing
 
06:08:19.070 --> 06:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
businesses to have a mandate in fact it
 
06:08:20.990 --> 06:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
prohibits them
 
06:08:22.788 --> 06:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
from placing a mandate
 
06:08:24.948 --> 06:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
so I know if I know that this amendment
 
06:08:27.530 --> 06:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
will wrongly tell our businesses how to
 
06:08:29.090 --> 06:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
run their business
 
06:08:30.650 --> 06:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this amendment will
 
06:08:32.868 --> 06:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
put us in out of compliance with respect
 
06:08:35.810 --> 06:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
to the CMS vaccine mandate resulting in
 
06:08:37.430 --> 06:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
potentially a massive loss of Medicare
 
06:08:39.350 --> 06:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid funding and therefore
 
06:08:42.110 --> 06:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
raising your taxes explain that to your
 
06:08:44.208 --> 06:08:44.218 align:start position:0%
voters and if I know that this amendment
 
06:08:46.010 --> 06:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
will endanger
 
06:08:47.990 --> 06:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
our patients and our nursing home
 
06:08:50.150 --> 06:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
residents and if I know that this
 
06:08:51.410 --> 06:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
amendment removes the right of
 
06:08:53.390 --> 06:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
association with those who support the
 
06:08:55.670 --> 06:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
control of infectious disease with
 
06:08:55.680 --> 06:08:56.360 align:start position:0%

06:20:15.770 --> 06:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
this bill is an example of a solution
 
06:20:18.650 --> 06:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
looking for a problem and then creating
 
06:20:22.730 --> 06:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
a very expensive unintended consequence
 
06:20:24.830 --> 06:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
despite the Secretary of State having a

06:20:44.570 --> 06:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
let me repeat that there is no evidence
 
06:20:47.090 --> 06:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
of people registering under a false
 
06:20:50.390 --> 06:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
identity here in New Hampshire
 
06:20:52.490 --> 06:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
to address a problem that's never been
 
06:20:53.930 --> 06:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
found to exist
 
06:20:56.330 --> 06:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
this bill creates provisional ballots
 
06:20:58.490 --> 06:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
that are marked to identify the voter
 
06:21:00.410 --> 06:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
casting the ballot
 
06:21:03.410 --> 06:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
those ballots are then set aside and
 
06:21:05.150 --> 06:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
counted separately
 
06:21:08.270 --> 06:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
seven days later if the voter has not
 
06:21:10.010 --> 06:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
gone back and provided the requested
 
06:21:11.868 --> 06:21:11.878 align:start position:0%
identification the ballots may be
 
06:21:14.030 --> 06:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
identified as being cast by specific
 
06:21:17.030 --> 06:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
voters and uncounted
 
06:21:19.548 --> 06:21:19.558 align:start position:0%
this means that elections cannot be
 
06:21:22.368 --> 06:21:22.378 align:start position:0%

06:21:56.150 --> 06:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
will not have sufficient time to print
 
06:21:58.430 --> 06:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
and mail the ballots to overseas voters
 
06:22:01.610 --> 06:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
within the requisite 45 days
 
06:22:03.948 --> 06:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
this means that members of our military
 
06:22:05.930 --> 06:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
stationed overseas
 
06:22:08.810 --> 06:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
government employees working overseas
 
06:22:11.330 --> 06:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
or other American citizens living
 
06:22:14.090 --> 06:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
overseas may not receive their ballots
 
06:22:15.650 --> 06:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
in time to be able to return them
 
06:22:17.448 --> 06:22:17.458 align:start position:0%
quickly enough to be counted on Election
 
06:22:17.458 --> 06:22:18.708 align:start position:0%
quickly enough to be counted on Election
Day

06:22:18.708 --> 06:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
Day
 
06:22:21.230 --> 06:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
hence the delay will put us both out of
 
06:22:23.810 --> 06:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
compliance with yokava and may
 
06:22:26.448 --> 06:22:26.458 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise overseas voters including
 
06:22:28.368 --> 06:22:28.378 align:start position:0%
our members of the military stationed
 
06:22:28.378 --> 06:22:30.230 align:start position:0%
our members of the military stationed
overseas

06:22:30.230 --> 06:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
06:22:33.948 --> 06:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
second New Hampshire enjoys an exemption
 
06:22:35.990 --> 06:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
from the national voter registration act
 
06:22:38.208 --> 06:22:38.218 align:start position:0%
sometimes called Motor Voter
 
06:22:40.730 --> 06:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
we have that exemption because our same
 
06:22:43.010 --> 06:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
day registration procedures
 
06:22:45.230 --> 06:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
this new requirement effectively
 
06:22:47.330 --> 06:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
eliminates the same day registration for
 
06:22:50.448 --> 06:22:50.458 align:start position:0%
certain voters thereby placing us out of
 
06:22:52.310 --> 06:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
compliance with the ACT
 
06:22:54.650 --> 06:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
if we are found not to be in compliance
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
we could be forced to completely change
 
06:22:59.628 --> 06:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
our voter registration procedures at an
 
06:23:03.770 --> 06:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
estimated cost of 6.5 million dollars
 
06:23:07.190 --> 06:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
all of this to stop fraud that's never
 
06:23:09.110 --> 06:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
been found
 
06:23:11.628 --> 06:23:11.638 align:start position:0%
third perhaps the most egregious
 
06:23:14.150 --> 06:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of the bill is
 
06:23:16.788 --> 06:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
that it creates violations of our own
 
06:23:18.948 --> 06:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
state constitution
 
06:23:21.890 --> 06:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
the Constitution guarantees our right to
 
06:23:23.510 --> 06:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
a secret ballot
 
06:23:25.548 --> 06:23:25.558 align:start position:0%
for those who have their ballots marked
 
06:23:28.190 --> 06:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
with an identifying label their ballots
 
06:23:30.410 --> 06:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
are no longer Secret
 
06:23:32.690 --> 06:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
any voting official can see the ballot
 
06:23:35.690 --> 06:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
and who cast it
 
06:23:35.700 --> 06:23:37.190 align:start position:0%
and who cast it
furthermore

06:23:37.190 --> 06:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
06:23:39.410 --> 06:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
subtracting votes after the tally is
 
06:23:41.510 --> 06:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
made election night is a violation of
 
06:23:45.230 --> 06:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
part two article 32 of the Constitution
 
06:23:48.110 --> 06:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
no doubt someone will sue the state over
 
06:23:52.250 --> 06:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:54.770 --> 06:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
the last time we passed a law to stop
 
06:23:57.368 --> 06:23:57.378 align:start position:0%
this kind of non-existent voter fraud
 
06:24:01.610 --> 06:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
sb3 it cost the state 4.2 million
 
06:24:04.010 --> 06:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
dollars in legal fees as well as the
 
06:24:06.230 --> 06:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
cost of two full-time lawyers for a year
 
06:24:08.270 --> 06:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
in the Department of Justice
 
06:24:10.490 --> 06:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
do we really want to face this kind of
 
06:24:13.310 --> 06:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
legal expense again
 
06:24:17.090 --> 06:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
this bill as a classic example of a bill
 
06:24:19.548 --> 06:24:19.558 align:start position:0%
that has very expensive unintended
 
06:24:22.310 --> 06:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
consequences it violates two federal
 
06:24:25.190 --> 06:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
laws it could cost taxpayers millions of
 
06:24:26.810 --> 06:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
dollars to restructure our voter
 
06:24:28.310 --> 06:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
registration system
 
06:24:31.010 --> 06:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
it violates two provisions of our New
 
06:24:33.110 --> 06:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution that could cost
 
06:24:35.570 --> 06:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
us Millions to try and defend the
 
06:24:35.580 --> 06:24:36.948 align:start position:0%
us Millions to try and defend the
indefensible

06:24:36.948 --> 06:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
indefensible
 
06:24:40.368 --> 06:24:40.378 align:start position:0%
all of this to try and stop fraud that
 
06:24:42.468 --> 06:24:42.478 align:start position:0%
has never been found anywhere in New
 
06:24:42.478 --> 06:24:43.610 align:start position:0%
has never been found anywhere in New
Hampshire

06:24:43.610 --> 06:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:24:46.368 --> 06:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
please join me in voting no on this
 
06:24:49.430 --> 06:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
deeply flawed bill so member yield the
 
06:24:54.350 --> 06:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:56.150 --> 06:24:56.160 align:start position:0%

Griffin

06:25:00.430 --> 06:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:02.810 --> 06:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:25:06.830 --> 06:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
I rise in support of SB 418 as amended
 
06:25:09.708 --> 06:25:09.718 align:start position:0%
by the finance committee the amended we
 
06:25:12.110 --> 06:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
just passed dealed with dealt with a
 
06:25:13.910 --> 06:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
technical deficiency that was found in
 
06:25:16.788 --> 06:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
regards to the processing and we've all
 
06:25:19.010 --> 06:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
agreed as to the bill being amended to
 
06:25:21.770 --> 06:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
address that I would point out that the
 
06:25:24.110 --> 06:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
affidavit process that you just heard
 
06:25:27.350 --> 06:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
about has already been approved by this
 
06:25:27.360 --> 06:25:28.310 align:start position:0%
about has already been approved by this
body

06:25:28.310 --> 06:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
body
 
06:25:30.830 --> 06:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
and it ensures that everyone who comes
 
06:25:32.628 --> 06:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
to the polling place on Election Day
 
06:25:35.448 --> 06:25:35.458 align:start position:0%
will be able to cast a ballot and it
 
06:25:37.610 --> 06:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
also ensures that all votes counted will
 
06:25:40.190 --> 06:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
be those cast by persons who can be
 
06:25:43.670 --> 06:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
identified you've heard many times at
 
06:25:45.708 --> 06:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
this well and you know yourself from
 
06:25:47.810 --> 06:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
observation on Election Day in New
 
06:25:50.448 --> 06:25:50.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anyone can vote regardless of
 
06:25:53.150 --> 06:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
their ability to prove who they are how
 
06:25:55.368 --> 06:25:55.378 align:start position:0%
old they are whether they're a citizen
 
06:25:57.948 --> 06:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
and where they're domiciled
 
06:26:01.070 --> 06:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
it is well established in court cases
 
06:26:03.288 --> 06:26:03.298 align:start position:0%
across the country that requiring
 
06:26:06.048 --> 06:26:06.058 align:start position:0%
identification is a reasonable
 
06:26:08.030 --> 06:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
requirement in regards to protecting
 
06:26:11.990 --> 06:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
State interests in running elections the
 
06:26:14.270 --> 06:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
issue here in New Hampshire is that our
 
06:26:16.490 --> 06:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
affidavit process has people voting and
 
06:26:19.368 --> 06:26:19.378 align:start position:0%
we have no idea who they are
 
06:26:23.150 --> 06:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
the process leaves us unable to verify
 
06:26:25.730 --> 06:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
them you've heard that this last
 
06:26:27.288 --> 06:26:27.298 align:start position:0%
election there were hundreds of people
 
06:26:30.110 --> 06:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
who voted without any identification and
 
06:26:32.208 --> 06:26:32.218 align:start position:0%
and so you may hear there's no
 
06:26:35.990 --> 06:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
prosecution in regards to voting
 
06:26:38.750 --> 06:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
for failure to have an ID but we can't
 
06:26:42.468 --> 06:26:42.478 align:start position:0%
identify who we would be prosecuting
 
06:26:45.890 --> 06:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
this seeks to solve that issue
 
06:26:48.770 --> 06:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
those individuals who register to vote
 
06:26:50.690 --> 06:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
on Election Day were only talking about
 
06:26:53.270 --> 06:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
election day registration who do not
 
06:26:55.490 --> 06:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
establish their ID within seven days
 
06:26:58.190 --> 06:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
will have their vote withdrawn from the
 
06:27:00.468 --> 06:27:00.478 align:start position:0%
vote total they still get to vote it's
 
06:27:03.770 --> 06:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
counted it's held there is no violation
 
06:27:06.468 --> 06:27:06.478 align:start position:0%
of federal law you heard again today
 
06:27:09.310 --> 06:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
about the potential of a vote count
 
06:27:12.708 --> 06:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
adverse impact on our overseas military
 
06:27:12.718 --> 06:27:14.270 align:start position:0%
adverse impact on our overseas military
voters

06:27:14.270 --> 06:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
voters
 
06:27:16.670 --> 06:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office has been
 
06:27:19.250 --> 06:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
contacted in regards to this issue and
 
06:27:21.590 --> 06:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
has responded that they can make it work
 
06:27:24.350 --> 06:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
and will meet the deadlines that are
 
06:27:28.010 --> 06:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
necessary for the overseas voters we
 
06:27:30.468 --> 06:27:30.478 align:start position:0%
have members on our committee who are
 
06:27:34.250 --> 06:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
military veterans I myself have a
 
06:27:37.310 --> 06:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
deceased brother who was a army vet a
 
06:27:39.770 --> 06:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
hundred percent disabled who did a
 
06:27:42.468 --> 06:27:42.478 align:start position:0%
lifetime service and served overseas
 
06:27:45.288 --> 06:27:45.298 align:start position:0%
many times no one on our committee would
 
06:27:47.810 --> 06:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
ever do anything to impair the ability
 
06:27:50.750 --> 06:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
of people to meet to meet their
 
06:27:55.030 --> 06:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional Duty or right to vote
 
06:27:58.670 --> 06:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
the reality is ballots are not prepared
 
06:28:02.090 --> 06:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
magically the day after election ballots
 
06:28:04.250 --> 06:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
need to be prepared for multiple
 
06:28:06.468 --> 06:28:06.478 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions with multiple variations
 
06:28:09.288 --> 06:28:09.298 align:start position:0%
and the process for printing them is not
 
06:28:11.868 --> 06:28:11.878 align:start position:0%
a day or two the Secretary of State's
 
06:28:13.910 --> 06:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
office can identify the jurisdictions
 
06:28:17.208 --> 06:28:17.218 align:start position:0%
that have persons who voted without an
 
06:28:20.628 --> 06:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
ID and registered on Election Day end
 
06:28:24.350 --> 06:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
where the number of affidavits might
 
06:28:26.868 --> 06:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
affect the vote total right if the if
 
06:28:29.690 --> 06:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
the margin a vote for your winners was
 
06:28:32.570 --> 06:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
10 and there were only two two persons
 
06:28:35.390 --> 06:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
who voted without an ID then clearly the
 
06:28:38.090 --> 06:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
use of the affidavit ID would have no
 
06:28:41.990 --> 06:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:44.750 --> 06:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
in regards to the issues of a secret
 
06:28:47.448 --> 06:28:47.458 align:start position:0%
ballot I would point out and and invite
 
06:28:49.548 --> 06:28:49.558 align:start position:0%
you to observe the processing of
 
06:28:51.230 --> 06:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
06:28:53.448 --> 06:28:53.458 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are tracked through the
 
06:28:55.610 --> 06:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
system so detailed that you can get
 
06:28:57.890 --> 06:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
online to track your absentee ballot
 
06:29:01.910 --> 06:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
which is matched with your signature in
 
06:29:03.830 --> 06:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
regards to what you submit and the
 
06:29:06.110 --> 06:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
envelope and then taken by a third party
 
06:29:09.110 --> 06:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
who has is handed the ballot from your
 
06:29:11.030 --> 06:29:11.040 align:start position:0%

the moderator in this process sees

they are now
 
06:29:24.948 --> 06:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
this process is a reasonable step
 
06:29:27.770 --> 06:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
towards ensuring that votes cast in our
 
06:29:30.170 --> 06:29:30.180 align:start position:0%

06:29:30.180 --> 06:29:31.250 align:start position:0%

06:31:31.190 --> 06:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
amended on Senate Bill 418 this is a
 
06:31:33.110 --> 06:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
roll call vote chair recognizes
 
06:31:34.190 --> 06:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bergeron for
 
06:31:39.590 --> 06:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:42.350 --> 06:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:31:44.628 --> 06:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
if I know that during Senate testimony
 
06:31:46.788 --> 06:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State expressed concern
 
06:31:49.670 --> 06:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
about the Privacy issue associated with
 
06:31:51.590 --> 06:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
matching ballots with specific voter
 
06:31:54.110 --> 06:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
names and further suggested that the
 
06:31:56.208 --> 06:31:56.218 align:start position:0%
Senate asked the Supreme Court to
 
06:31:57.948 --> 06:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
respond to questions about whether or
 
06:31:59.990 --> 06:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
not a vote can be removed or not counted
 
06:32:01.850 --> 06:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
after the return of votes have been
 
06:32:05.390 --> 06:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
filed but the Senate refused to do so
 
06:32:07.250 --> 06:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
and if I know that there are less than
 
06:32:09.530 --> 06:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
60 days between the conclusion of the
 
06:32:11.930 --> 06:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
state primary recount period and the
 
06:32:14.030 --> 06:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
date of the state general election
 
06:32:15.948 --> 06:32:15.958 align:start position:0%
and that Federal Law requires that
 
06:32:17.628 --> 06:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots be available to
 
06:32:19.850 --> 06:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
Uniformed and overseas citizens at least
 
06:32:23.628 --> 06:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
45 days prior to the general election
 
06:32:25.490 --> 06:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill requires
 
06:32:27.530 --> 06:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
towns to submit a report of provisional
 
06:32:30.650 --> 06:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
ballots cast 14 days after the state
 
06:32:32.750 --> 06:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
primary and that the deadline for
 
06:32:35.090 --> 06:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
requests for recounts must be extended
 
06:32:37.070 --> 06:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
to allow for submission of these
 
06:32:39.770 --> 06:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
materials thus making it impossible to
 
06:32:41.628 --> 06:32:41.638 align:start position:0%
fully comply with Federal requirements
 
06:32:44.150 --> 06:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
the general election absentee ballots be
 
06:32:46.010 --> 06:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
made available to Uniformed and overseas
 
06:32:48.830 --> 06:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
citizens at least 45 days prior to the
 
06:32:50.270 --> 06:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
general election
 
06:32:52.250 --> 06:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
and if I know the provisions in the bill
 
06:32:54.350 --> 06:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
could result in New Hampshire losing its
 
06:32:56.030 --> 06:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
exemption to the National voter
 
06:32:58.128 --> 06:32:58.138 align:start position:0%
registration act and that the cost to
 
06:32:59.690 --> 06:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
implement Motor Voter requirements
 
06:33:02.150 --> 06:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
should cost New Hampshire close to 6.5
 
06:33:03.708 --> 06:33:03.718 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
06:33:06.110 --> 06:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
but I then press the red no button to
 
06:33:07.850 --> 06:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
oppose the motion of ought to pass so
 
06:33:09.770 --> 06:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
that a subsequent motion can be
 
06:33:12.288 --> 06:33:12.298 align:start position:0%
presented thank you I recognize
 
06:33:13.490 --> 06:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative Emrick for a
 
06:33:18.430 --> 06:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:21.048 --> 06:33:21.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:33:24.410 --> 06:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill is a tempest in
 
06:33:26.208 --> 06:33:26.218 align:start position:0%
a teapot based on the numbers which we
 
06:33:29.090 --> 06:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
look at in finance and if I know that
 
06:33:31.430 --> 06:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State indicated that
 
06:33:33.350 --> 06:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
approxim a number of ballots were
 
06:33:36.430 --> 06:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
talking about at the last election was
 
06:33:40.070 --> 06:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
733 who were affidavit ballots and of
 
06:33:42.170 --> 06:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
those they estimated maybe 200 were
 
06:33:44.750 --> 06:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
first-time register registrants then
 
06:33:47.090 --> 06:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 200 first-time
 
06:33:50.090 --> 06:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
registrants at 308 voting places in the
 
06:33:52.730 --> 06:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
state this is not a significant number
 
06:33:55.250 --> 06:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
and I think it's very manageable to have
 
06:33:58.310 --> 06:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
good elections please vote green thank

would not be jeopardized as that
 
06:37:30.048 --> 06:37:30.058 align:start position:0%
opportunity already exists within the
 
06:37:32.570 --> 06:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
provisions of the program
 
06:37:34.430 --> 06:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
just want to reiterate that this has

06:38:14.868 --> 06:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
the tax credit scholarship fund was
 
06:38:17.570 --> 06:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
created to support students from
 
06:38:19.430 --> 06:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
low-income families
 
06:38:22.128 --> 06:38:22.138 align:start position:0%
the amendment expands the annual income
 
06:38:24.530 --> 06:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
parameter from 300 percent which is
 
06:38:28.070 --> 06:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
about 79 000 for a family of four to
 
06:38:30.530 --> 06:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
five hundred percent which is about 138
 
06:38:32.750 --> 06:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars annual income
 
06:38:36.288 --> 06:38:36.298 align:start position:0%
currently the program has exists has a a
 
06:38:38.150 --> 06:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
waiting list larger than the number of
 
06:38:39.948 --> 06:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
students they served
 
06:38:42.468 --> 06:38:42.478 align:start position:0%
why would the legislature want to expand
 
06:38:46.430 --> 06:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
an annual income requirement
 
06:38:50.208 --> 06:38:50.218 align:start position:0%
when we can't fill the list of folks who
 
06:38:52.128 --> 06:38:52.138 align:start position:0%
are already low income
 
06:38:53.810 --> 06:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
additionally there is nothing contained
 
06:38:56.270 --> 06:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
in the legislation to require low-income
 
06:38:58.190 --> 06:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
families to be granted funding
 
06:39:00.230 --> 06:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
before those families with the expanded
 
06:39:02.390 --> 06:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
income of the additional fifty thousand
 
06:39:02.400 --> 06:39:03.830 align:start position:0%
income of the additional fifty thousand
dollars

06:39:03.830 --> 06:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:39:06.110 --> 06:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
about 45 percent of the students
 
06:39:07.788 --> 06:39:07.798 align:start position:0%
currently serve meet the federal
 
06:39:10.788 --> 06:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
guidelines for free reduced lunch which
 
06:39:13.850 --> 06:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
also means that 55 percent are below the
 
06:39:15.770 --> 06:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
lowest threshold
 
06:39:19.368 --> 06:39:19.378 align:start position:0%
the HB 1298 it barely passed this house
 
06:39:20.628 --> 06:39:20.638 align:start position:0%

and if I know the tax credit program was
 
06:42:02.690 --> 06:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
billed as a way for lower income

already on a waiting list but this bill
 
06:42:15.410 --> 06:42:15.420 align:start position:0%

06:48:34.910 --> 06:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
reading open to further Amendment
 
06:48:36.530 --> 06:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards offers floor
 
06:48:40.190 --> 06:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1909 H in your seat pockets
 
06:48:42.590 --> 06:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
06:48:46.910 --> 06:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
Edwards to speak to his Amendment
 
06:48:50.270 --> 06:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Speaker with this
 
06:48:53.468 --> 06:48:53.478 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it
 
06:48:56.930 --> 06:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
reinstitutes a house bill that we passed
 
06:48:59.750 --> 06:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago sponsored by
 
06:49:02.750 --> 06:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative McLean went over to the
 
06:49:05.090 --> 06:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
other body and they they put it in
 
06:49:08.690 --> 06:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
interim study what we're trying to do is
 
06:49:12.350 --> 06:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
to indicate to the other body that this
 
06:49:15.230 --> 06:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
was a serious idea what what we what
 
06:49:17.030 --> 06:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
we've proposed what representative
 
06:49:22.730 --> 06:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
McLean proposed was that if if there is
 
06:49:25.250 --> 06:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
a Health Care Organization that's a
 
06:49:28.190 --> 06:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
membership based only or receives cash
 
06:49:31.610 --> 06:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
payments only that they would not be
 
06:49:33.730 --> 06:49:33.740 align:start position:0%
required to accept
 
06:49:36.530 --> 06:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
patients that aren't within that
 
06:49:36.540 --> 06:49:37.628 align:start position:0%
patients that aren't within that
particular

06:49:37.628 --> 06:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
particular
 
06:49:42.170 --> 06:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
payer mix and there aren't any of these
 
06:49:46.070 --> 06:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire right now so if you've
 
06:49:49.010 --> 06:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
heard that this is going to hurt our
 
06:49:50.990 --> 06:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
critical care hospitals and the like
 
06:49:53.930 --> 06:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
it's not true because these things don't
 
06:49:56.930 --> 06:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
yet exist and are critical care
 
06:49:59.090 --> 06:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
facilities and others are protected with
 
06:50:03.350 --> 06:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
a 15-mile radius so that there it's a
 
06:50:07.610 --> 06:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
non-competitive situation in any case so
 
06:50:07.620 --> 06:50:08.270 align:start position:0%
non-competitive situation in any case so
um

06:50:08.270 --> 06:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:10.368 --> 06:50:10.378 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago we passed a direct
 
06:50:13.010 --> 06:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
primary care bill there weren't any
 
06:50:15.230 --> 06:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
direct Primary Care Providers at the
 
06:50:17.948 --> 06:50:17.958 align:start position:0%
time that legislation
 
06:50:20.570 --> 06:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
fertilize the ground and now we have
 
06:50:23.750 --> 06:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
some direct primary care so what this is
 
06:50:26.270 --> 06:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
attempting to do is to lay the ground
 
06:50:28.910 --> 06:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
and fertilize it again so that we can
 
06:50:31.128 --> 06:50:31.138 align:start position:0%
create another alternative in our Health
 
06:50:33.830 --> 06:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
Care system if we keep doing the same
 
06:50:37.070 --> 06:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
thing over and over and over again we're
 
06:50:38.690 --> 06:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
going to get the same kind of broken
 
06:50:41.930 --> 06:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
results one of the great benefits of
 
06:50:44.270 --> 06:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
doing this if we can get some of these
 
06:50:46.510 --> 06:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
direct pay payment
 
06:50:49.430 --> 06:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
organizations in place then we'll start
 
06:50:51.830 --> 06:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
to really know what the true costs are
 
06:50:55.250 --> 06:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
if you were to go to ask prior to a
 
06:50:56.868 --> 06:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
procedure exactly what they're going to
 
06:50:58.910 --> 06:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
charge you for a given procedure they
 
06:51:01.548 --> 06:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
can't give you a price because the payer
 
06:51:03.890 --> 06:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
mixes are so complicated that they can't
 
06:51:07.670 --> 06:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
get to reality so so this is an
 
06:51:12.048 --> 06:51:12.058 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to peel it back and
 
06:51:14.330 --> 06:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
take a fresh look at Healthcare delivery
 
06:51:16.310 --> 06:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I hope you vote in
 
06:51:17.868 --> 06:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
favor of it
 
06:51:20.330 --> 06:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Leon for
 
06:51:20.340 --> 06:51:29.090 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Leon for
speak

06:51:29.090 --> 06:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:31.670 --> 06:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
what this amendment would do is it would
 
06:51:33.948 --> 06:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
allow hospitals to operate out of the
 
06:51:35.868 --> 06:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
side of the sphere of influence of CMS
 
06:51:38.270 --> 06:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
the centers for Medicaid services that's
 
06:51:40.670 --> 06:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
all it does and that's enough
 
06:51:42.468 --> 06:51:42.478 align:start position:0%
I've heard opponents of this bill say
 
06:51:44.150 --> 06:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
that it means that hospitals won't need
 
06:51:45.830 --> 06:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
to have an emergency room won't need to
 
06:51:47.628 --> 06:51:47.638 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for charity charity
 
06:51:47.638 --> 06:51:49.310 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for charity charity
care

06:51:49.310 --> 06:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
care
 
06:51:51.708 --> 06:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
that all this changes is the requirement
 
06:51:54.708 --> 06:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
for a hospital to take all payers we've
 
06:51:56.330 --> 06:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
seen the power of that
 
06:51:59.150 --> 06:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
right now CMS is telling us what laws we
 
06:52:01.850 --> 06:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
can pass here in New Hampshire CMS is
 
06:52:03.770 --> 06:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
telling us what our hospitals can and
 
06:52:06.830 --> 06:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
can't do and CMS is basically telling us
 
06:52:08.930 --> 06:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
what doctors and other Healthcare Heroes
 
06:52:12.890 --> 06:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:15.468 --> 06:52:15.478 align:start position:0%
we have direct pay primary care and so
 
06:52:17.150 --> 06:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of providers who do have
 
06:52:20.868 --> 06:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
an option to practice outside of this um
 
06:52:23.390 --> 06:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the spirit of CMS influence
 
06:52:25.430 --> 06:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
but some doctors can only work in a
 
06:52:27.530 --> 06:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
hospital would you see a surgeon who
 
06:52:30.610 --> 06:52:30.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:33.590 --> 06:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
these doctors right now are forced
 
06:52:35.270 --> 06:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
between continuing to practice in New
 
06:52:37.190 --> 06:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire while complying with all of
 
06:52:39.110 --> 06:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
these mandates are going to some other
 
06:52:40.730 --> 06:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
state that's putting up more of a fight
 
06:52:42.830 --> 06:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
do we want our surgeons to move to
 
06:52:42.840 --> 06:52:43.850 align:start position:0%
do we want our surgeons to move to
Florida

06:52:43.850 --> 06:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
06:52:45.650 --> 06:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
do we want them to just retire and stop
 
06:52:45.660 --> 06:52:47.570 align:start position:0%
do we want them to just retire and stop
practicing

06:52:47.570 --> 06:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
06:52:50.868 --> 06:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
we have a health care shortage
 
06:52:53.690 --> 06:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
we need to pass this amendment and send
 
06:52:55.850 --> 06:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
this on to the Senate so we can have an
 
06:52:57.650 --> 06:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
option for these surgeons who otherwise
 
06:52:59.628 --> 06:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
would no longer practice in New
 
06:53:02.330 --> 06:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to open up their own hospitals
 
06:53:04.430 --> 06:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
allow them to negotiate with the payers
 
06:53:07.128 --> 06:53:07.138 align:start position:0%
oh negotiate with the with the patients
 
06:53:09.590 --> 06:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
because right now the payers decide what
 
06:53:09.600 --> 06:53:10.610 align:start position:0%
because right now the payers decide what
happens

06:53:10.610 --> 06:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
happens
 
06:53:18.170 --> 06:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:20.570 --> 06:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
this will be small it'll be Niche we
 
06:53:23.030 --> 06:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
still have the 15 Mile buffer we're not
 
06:53:24.708 --> 06:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
going to allow these to open up next to
 
06:53:26.510 --> 06:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
our critical access hospitals because
 
06:53:29.810 --> 06:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
this doesn't change that part of the law
 
06:53:31.548 --> 06:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
please pass this so that the patients
 
06:53:33.350 --> 06:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
are in control when you write the check
 
06:53:35.270 --> 06:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
you make the decision and you'd work
 
06:53:38.448 --> 06:53:38.458 align:start position:0%
directly with your doctor thank you
 
06:53:51.110 --> 06:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:53.330 --> 06:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:53:55.368 --> 06:53:55.378 align:start position:0%
indeed I Rise to speak against this
 
06:53:59.330 --> 06:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
amendment to SB 430 as stated this
 
06:54:00.830 --> 06:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
amendment would add the wording of HB
 
06:54:04.368 --> 06:54:04.378 align:start position:0%
1044 to SB 430 and as it was sent to
 
06:54:07.310 --> 06:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
interim study in the Senate
 
06:54:09.530 --> 06:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
now first of all contrary to what was
 
06:54:11.090 --> 06:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
just said this has nothing to do with
 
06:54:14.270 --> 06:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
providers individual practitioners this
 
06:54:16.430 --> 06:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
has to do with facilities
 
06:54:18.830 --> 06:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
facility licensing that's where this
 
06:54:20.270 --> 06:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
statute resides
 
06:54:22.128 --> 06:54:22.138 align:start position:0%
currently licensed health care
 
06:54:24.530 --> 06:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
facilities are required to provide
 
06:54:27.410 --> 06:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
services to all persons regardless of
 
06:54:27.420 --> 06:54:28.968 align:start position:0%
services to all persons regardless of
payment

06:54:28.968 --> 06:54:28.978 align:start position:0%
payment
 
06:54:31.310 --> 06:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
this requirement was added by the
 
06:54:35.448 --> 06:54:35.458 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2016 to ensure access to
 
06:54:38.330 --> 06:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
services for low-income individuals and
 
06:54:40.850 --> 06:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
those covered by Medicaid
 
06:54:42.650 --> 06:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
and the reason for this requirement is
 
06:54:45.170 --> 06:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
really pretty straightforward Medicaid
 
06:54:47.570 --> 06:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
would be useless if facilities will not
 
06:54:50.510 --> 06:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
treat patients who are covered by
 
06:54:50.520 --> 06:54:51.830 align:start position:0%
treat patients who are covered by
Medicaid

06:54:51.830 --> 06:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
06:54:54.410 --> 06:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
and we also have uninsured patients who
 
06:54:55.850 --> 06:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
need care
 
06:54:57.650 --> 06:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
and guess what
 
06:54:59.510 --> 06:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
they don't just crawl away and die they
 
06:55:01.670 --> 06:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
need care
 
06:55:04.490 --> 06:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
they need access
 
06:55:06.530 --> 06:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
this amendment would exempt from this
 
06:55:07.968 --> 06:55:07.978 align:start position:0%
requirement the health care facilities
 
06:55:10.490 --> 06:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
which exclusively provide services on a
 
06:55:12.530 --> 06:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
membership-based business model
 
06:55:15.350 --> 06:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
or to persons who make a direct payment
 
06:55:18.350 --> 06:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
without any reimbursement or third-party
 
06:55:18.360 --> 06:55:20.030 align:start position:0%
without any reimbursement or third-party
payment

06:55:20.030 --> 06:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
payment
 
06:55:21.708 --> 06:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
some folks have claimed that this is
 
06:55:22.968 --> 06:55:22.978 align:start position:0%
going to actually help those with high
 
06:55:25.548 --> 06:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
deductibles but it won't because the
 
06:55:28.090 --> 06:55:28.100 align:start position:0%
only way to have the any payment
 
06:55:30.170 --> 06:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
accredited to your high deductible
 
06:55:32.270 --> 06:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
insurance plan is if you submit the bill
 
06:55:33.890 --> 06:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
to the insurance company and that is
 
06:55:36.048 --> 06:55:36.058 align:start position:0%
prohibited by the language of this
 
06:55:36.058 --> 06:55:38.330 align:start position:0%
prohibited by the language of this
amendment

06:55:38.330 --> 06:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:55:41.750 --> 06:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
so it seems kind of like a minor change
 
06:55:43.670 --> 06:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
right well it isn't
 
06:55:45.468 --> 06:55:45.478 align:start position:0%
the comment that we're not seeing by
 
06:55:47.030 --> 06:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
problem from something that doesn't yet
 
06:55:49.190 --> 06:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
exist well golly
 
06:55:51.650 --> 06:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't would we the question is
 
06:55:53.628 --> 06:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
what will happen
 
06:55:56.270 --> 06:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
such a change will allow a very small
 
06:55:58.250 --> 06:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
number of for-profit Institutions
 
06:56:01.010 --> 06:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
offering things like Urgent Care
 
06:56:03.530 --> 06:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
birthing services or Ambulatory Surgery
 
06:56:06.650 --> 06:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
to skim off the patients who can pay a
 
06:56:10.070 --> 06:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
full cash price changing the payer mix
 
06:56:13.128 --> 06:56:13.138 align:start position:0%
to the remaining hospitals or other
 
06:56:13.138 --> 06:56:15.288 align:start position:0%
to the remaining hospitals or other
facilities

06:56:15.288 --> 06:56:15.298 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
06:56:18.770 --> 06:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
now maintaining pair mix is important
 
06:56:21.468 --> 06:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
our critical access hospitals run on
 
06:56:23.930 --> 06:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
razor thin margins
 
06:56:25.490 --> 06:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
some of them actually just run a little
 
06:56:27.170 --> 06:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
bit into the red they can't really make
 
06:56:27.180 --> 06:56:28.010 align:start position:0%
bit into the red they can't really make
it

06:56:28.010 --> 06:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:56:30.708 --> 06:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
and they lose money on services such as
 
06:56:32.868 --> 06:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
full service 24-hour per day emergency
 
06:56:35.570 --> 06:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
room and obstetrical services which
 
06:56:37.850 --> 06:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
serve a lot of people on Medicaid or
 
06:56:40.430 --> 06:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
with no insurance
 
06:56:42.708 --> 06:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
again this is little Health you know
 
06:56:46.190 --> 06:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
Health Care financing 101 here those
 
06:56:46.200 --> 06:56:48.350 align:start position:0%
Health Care financing 101 here those
services

06:56:48.350 --> 06:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:56:50.930 --> 06:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
are which are critical to have in the
 
06:56:54.350 --> 06:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
rural areas are subsidized by the higher
 
06:56:56.990 --> 06:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
paying services and higher paying
 
06:56:58.368 --> 06:56:58.378 align:start position:0%
insurances you go and you have your
 
06:56:59.628 --> 06:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
total hip replacement done with
 
06:57:01.490 --> 06:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
insurance that's going to be some of the
 
06:57:02.810 --> 06:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
money that is going to help keep that
 
06:57:04.730 --> 06:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
emergency room open so if you get run
 
06:57:06.530 --> 06:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
over by a car you have a place to be
 
06:57:10.490 --> 06:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:12.410 --> 06:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
skimming off the higher paying patients
 
06:57:14.208 --> 06:57:14.218 align:start position:0%
will have a significant negative
 
06:57:16.128 --> 06:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
economic impact on our critical access
 
06:57:18.890 --> 06:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
hospitals and we are seeing closures of
 
06:57:20.930 --> 06:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
critical aspect access hospitals around
 
06:57:22.368 --> 06:57:22.378 align:start position:0%
the country
 
06:57:24.048 --> 06:57:24.058 align:start position:0%
there will be a substantial risk of
 
06:57:26.090 --> 06:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
closure or the need to drop critical
 
06:57:28.670 --> 06:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
service such as maternity and we've seen
 
06:57:31.128 --> 06:57:31.138 align:start position:0%
that happen in this very state
 
06:57:32.810 --> 06:57:32.820 align:start position:0%
because it is not a money-making
 
06:57:32.820 --> 06:57:34.968 align:start position:0%
because it is not a money-making
proposition

06:57:34.968 --> 06:57:34.978 align:start position:0%
proposition
 
06:57:36.410 --> 06:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
this will leave large number of
 
06:57:38.330 --> 06:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
individuals especially in rural areas
 
06:57:41.090 --> 06:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
like where I live with no access to
 
06:57:43.730 --> 06:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
timely medical care for emergencies or
 
06:57:43.740 --> 06:57:45.468 align:start position:0%
timely medical care for emergencies or
childbirth

06:57:45.468 --> 06:57:45.478 align:start position:0%
childbirth
 
06:57:48.110 --> 06:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
the losses sustained by those facilities
 
06:57:50.270 --> 06:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
will be shifted to those who have
 
06:57:50.280 --> 06:57:51.890 align:start position:0%
will be shifted to those who have
insurance

06:57:51.890 --> 06:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
06:57:54.048 --> 06:57:54.058 align:start position:0%
driving up the cost for everyone else
 
06:57:56.868 --> 06:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
and not changing that Total Health Care
 
06:57:56.878 --> 06:57:58.010 align:start position:0%
and not changing that Total Health Care
cost

06:57:58.010 --> 06:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
cost
 
06:57:59.930 --> 06:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
and a comment was just made about that
 
06:58:02.448 --> 06:58:02.458 align:start position:0%
protection with a 15-mile radius
 
06:58:05.330 --> 06:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
that's not sufficient to do anything I
 
06:58:07.548 --> 06:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
live just a little over 15 miles from
 
06:58:09.830 --> 06:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
either Huggins hospital or Memorial
 
06:58:09.840 --> 06:58:11.150 align:start position:0%
either Huggins hospital or Memorial
Hospital

06:58:11.150 --> 06:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
06:58:13.730 --> 06:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
I have to drive over 15 miles for any
 
06:58:15.288 --> 06:58:15.298 align:start position:0%
facility care for those who live in the
 
06:58:16.368 --> 06:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state you're not
 
06:58:18.468 --> 06:58:18.478 align:start position:0%
used to the kind of distances we have to
 
06:58:20.690 --> 06:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
drive to get any kind of care
 
06:58:22.430 --> 06:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
a facility placed for example in
 
06:58:24.830 --> 06:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
Tamworth would not be governed by RSA
 
06:58:28.430 --> 06:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
151 4A is it would be outside of that 15
 
06:58:30.590 --> 06:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
mile radius and it could draw from both
 
06:58:34.850 --> 06:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:38.448 --> 06:58:38.458 align:start position:0%
so think about a woman in labor who
 
06:58:41.150 --> 06:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
makes the mistake of going to a local
 
06:58:44.030 --> 06:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
birthing center in her Town only
 
06:58:47.990 --> 06:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
discover between contractions that they
 
06:58:50.390 --> 06:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
only serve an elite group
 
06:58:53.628 --> 06:58:53.638 align:start position:0%
she packs up drives perhaps another hour
 
06:58:55.670 --> 06:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
to get to the only remaining hospital
 
06:58:59.448 --> 06:58:59.458 align:start position:0%
that still offers maternity services
 
06:59:02.868 --> 06:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
or she may deliver in her car in a
 
06:59:04.788 --> 06:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
parking lot and we have certainly seen
 
06:59:06.530 --> 06:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
that happen a great deal more after some
 
06:59:08.390 --> 06:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
of our places have closed their
 
06:59:10.070 --> 06:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
maternity Services we see an increased
 
06:59:12.410 --> 06:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
number of babies who are delivered by
 
06:59:14.890 --> 06:59:14.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:17.330 --> 06:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
imtala emta la which is the emergency
 
06:59:19.128 --> 06:59:19.138 align:start position:0%
medical treatment and Labor Act actually
 
06:59:21.948 --> 06:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
prohibits turning her away this proposal
 
06:59:25.548 --> 06:59:25.558 align:start position:0%
would violate emtala
 
06:59:28.310 --> 06:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
now the sponsors presented this bill as
 
06:59:33.170 --> 06:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:35.330 --> 06:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
that's a rather unusual way to think of
 
06:59:36.650 --> 06:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
the pre-mark free market because this
 
06:59:38.750 --> 06:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill does not support a free market if
 
06:59:40.010 --> 06:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
you give favorite treatment to
 
06:59:42.530 --> 06:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
facilities using one business model at
 
06:59:44.570 --> 06:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
the expense of others
 
06:59:46.430 --> 06:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
as far as I know that's not the free
 
06:59:46.440 --> 06:59:48.110 align:start position:0%
as far as I know that's not the free
market

06:59:48.110 --> 06:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
market
 
06:59:49.968 --> 06:59:49.978 align:start position:0%
and the business model of our health
 
06:59:53.570 --> 06:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
care System should not be to make money
 
06:59:55.788 --> 06:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
off the Healthy and Wealthy
 
06:59:57.590 --> 06:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
while letting the sick and less
 
07:00:02.510 --> 07:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:04.310 --> 07:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment will decrease access to
 
07:00:06.048 --> 07:00:06.058 align:start position:0%
health care and will not drive down the
 
07:00:08.390 --> 07:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
overall cost of Health Care

if I know that our critical assets

access hospitals run on razor thin
 
07:03:09.468 --> 07:03:09.478 align:start position:0%
margins and require a payer mix

Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare back that's
 
07:03:29.208 --> 07:03:29.218 align:start position:0%
not the insurance part but the provider
 
07:03:31.670 --> 07:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
group and we took Medicaid
 
07:03:33.468 --> 07:03:33.478 align:start position:0%
after a while we did in the beginning we
 
07:03:34.610 --> 07:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
did later
 
07:03:36.468 --> 07:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
and if I know that skimming off those
 
07:03:38.090 --> 07:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
higher paying patients would have a
 
07:03:40.010 --> 07:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
significant negative economic effect on
 
07:03:42.650 --> 07:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
our critical access hospitals leading to
 
07:03:45.770 --> 07:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
closures of obstetrical services and of

critical access hospitals which are
 
07:03:50.690 --> 07:03:50.700 align:start position:0%

rural areas
 
07:03:54.948 --> 07:03:54.958 align:start position:0%

07:03:56.448 --> 07:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
want this the New Hampshire Hospital
 
07:03:59.530 --> 07:03:59.540 align:start position:0%
Association testified against
 
07:04:02.750 --> 07:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
hb1044 and lastly if I know that this
 
07:04:04.310 --> 07:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
amendment will decrease access to health
 
07:04:06.410 --> 07:04:06.420 align:start position:0%

than when I press the green button to

07:17:41.570 --> 07:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know
 
07:17:43.730 --> 07:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
the vote on the table in motion was
 
07:17:43.740 --> 07:17:47.510 align:start position:0%
the vote on the table in motion was
209-121

07:17:47.510 --> 07:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:50.570 --> 07:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know why we voted
 
07:17:53.150 --> 07:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
that way is because the house already
 
07:17:57.288 --> 07:17:57.298 align:start position:0%
has a position on bail reform
 
07:18:00.948 --> 07:18:00.958 align:start position:0%

relative to the suspension of a vehicle
 
07:20:29.990 --> 07:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
registration as a result of evading toll
 
07:20:32.150 --> 07:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
collection systems consider the same
 
07:20:33.590 --> 07:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
report the same with the recommendation
 
07:20:35.510 --> 07:20:35.520 align:start position:0%

07:20:54.350 --> 07:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:57.230 --> 07:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I've spoke against this bill
 
07:21:02.090 --> 07:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:06.530 --> 07:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:08.690 --> 07:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
several of my friends are registering
 
07:21:10.430 --> 07:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
their vehicles in Maine
 
07:21:12.650 --> 07:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
I'm considering it
 
07:21:14.810 --> 07:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
and there's eight total states that do
 
07:21:14.820 --> 07:21:16.190 align:start position:0%
and there's eight total states that do
this

07:21:16.190 --> 07:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:21:19.968 --> 07:21:19.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:22.430 --> 07:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
taking registrations away from people
 
07:21:25.788 --> 07:21:25.798 align:start position:0%
for not paying their fines or paying
 
07:21:29.270 --> 07:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
their tolls which in my eyes they should
 
07:21:31.128 --> 07:21:31.138 align:start position:0%
be brought to court for not paying their
 
07:21:33.830 --> 07:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
tolls just go to court and the Court's
 
07:21:35.750 --> 07:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to say did you do it there's a
 
07:21:37.730 --> 07:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
license plate there's a picture of it
 
07:21:39.888 --> 07:21:39.898 align:start position:0%
yeah I did it all right then pay your
 
07:21:42.288 --> 07:21:42.298 align:start position:0%
tolls and if you don't pay your tolls
 
07:21:44.690 --> 07:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
you're going to be in trouble
 
07:21:46.610 --> 07:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
you know this is a this is a court
 
07:21:49.190 --> 07:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
matter it shouldn't be to pull your
 
07:21:51.530 --> 07:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
registration because if you pull your
 
07:21:53.448 --> 07:21:53.458 align:start position:0%
registration Mr Speaker then the person
 
07:21:55.250 --> 07:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
can't get to work and pay his rent and
 
07:21:57.530 --> 07:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
everything else or hers
 
07:22:03.468 --> 07:22:03.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:06.590 --> 07:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
because once we start this
 
07:22:09.410 --> 07:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to add more things on it
 
07:22:11.030 --> 07:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
next year
 
07:22:13.730 --> 07:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
end the year after and the year after
 
07:22:16.250 --> 07:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
and the year after because that's what
 
07:22:18.170 --> 07:22:18.180 align:start position:0%
Connecticut did
 
07:22:20.628 --> 07:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
they started with just pulling their
 
07:22:22.730 --> 07:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
registrations on a few things now it's
 
07:22:25.430 --> 07:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
virtually any tax that you do not pay
 
07:22:27.468 --> 07:22:27.478 align:start position:0%
they pull your registration in
 
07:22:30.048 --> 07:22:30.058 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and as I said last time Mr
 
07:22:33.590 --> 07:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker if you uh the article that I
 
07:22:36.048 --> 07:22:36.058 align:start position:0%
read in the paper
 
07:22:38.750 --> 07:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut police said if you go
 
07:22:41.810 --> 07:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
down any Street in Connecticut you'll
 
07:22:44.690 --> 07:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
see at least one to three main license
 
07:22:44.700 --> 07:22:46.490 align:start position:0%
see at least one to three main license
plates

07:22:46.490 --> 07:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
plates
 
07:22:48.530 --> 07:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
because that's what people are doing to
 
07:22:50.208 --> 07:22:50.218 align:start position:0%
get away from this there is a loophole
 
07:22:52.128 --> 07:22:52.138 align:start position:0%
that they're going to do because all you
 
07:22:53.930 --> 07:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
have to do is register your car through
 
07:22:57.708 --> 07:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
your LLC or a business in is a federal
 
07:23:00.708 --> 07:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
matter at that point
 
07:23:04.368 --> 07:23:04.378 align:start position:0%
so I hope you vote with me and say no to
 
07:23:04.378 --> 07:23:05.570 align:start position:0%
so I hope you vote with me and say no to
this

07:23:05.570 --> 07:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:23:08.270 --> 07:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker
 
07:23:12.468 --> 07:23:12.478 align:start position:0%
I have been here 12 years
 
07:23:15.048 --> 07:23:15.058 align:start position:0%
and I have always known
 
07:23:20.628 --> 07:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:34.968 --> 07:23:34.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:34.978 --> 07:23:40.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:23:40.250 --> 07:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:43.010 --> 07:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
good evening
 
07:23:45.888 --> 07:23:45.898 align:start position:0%
sorry the finance has taken so much time
 
07:23:49.250 --> 07:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
but anyhow
 
07:23:51.230 --> 07:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
on um
 
07:23:52.810 --> 07:23:52.820 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:23:56.388 --> 07:23:56.398 align:start position:0%
registering your car in Maine
 
07:23:58.850 --> 07:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't help you
 
07:24:03.048 --> 07:24:03.058 align:start position:0%
because you will still have to pay the
 
07:24:03.058 --> 07:24:04.368 align:start position:0%
because you will still have to pay the
fines

07:24:04.368 --> 07:24:04.378 align:start position:0%
fines
 
07:24:07.730 --> 07:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
you will still have to pay the tolls
 
07:24:09.948 --> 07:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
if you drive through them
 
07:24:12.770 --> 07:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
without pain
 
07:24:15.410 --> 07:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
this is
 
07:24:18.110 --> 07:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
it has gone to the point
 
07:24:18.120 --> 07:24:20.810 align:start position:0%
it has gone to the point
where

07:24:20.810 --> 07:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
where
 
07:24:24.770 --> 07:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
we have habitual offenders
 
07:24:27.128 --> 07:24:27.138 align:start position:0%
you know kind of like alcohol
 
07:24:31.190 --> 07:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
habitual offenders that just think that
 
07:24:33.170 --> 07:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
07:24:36.288 --> 07:24:36.298 align:start position:0%
to not pay their tolls
 
07:24:38.570 --> 07:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
you know forget the fact that you can
 
07:24:41.208 --> 07:24:41.218 align:start position:0%
get one of those little
 
07:24:45.650 --> 07:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
ID things for I think it's five dollars
 
07:24:48.888 --> 07:24:48.898 align:start position:0%
and you can pay by your credit card
 
07:24:52.490 --> 07:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
but they just refuse to do it and these
 
07:24:56.930 --> 07:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
are people that use the toll roads every
 
07:24:59.208 --> 07:24:59.218 align:start position:0%
single day
 
07:25:02.628 --> 07:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
and they have thousands of dollars
 
07:25:05.150 --> 07:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
that they owe to the state
 
07:25:07.250 --> 07:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
and guess what
 
07:25:10.788 --> 07:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
these are thousands of dollars that we
 
07:25:16.010 --> 07:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
don't have to repair the turnpikes
 
07:25:19.388 --> 07:25:19.398 align:start position:0%
you know it's just sitting out there
 
07:25:23.208 --> 07:25:23.218 align:start position:0%
waiting for it to come in
 
07:25:27.170 --> 07:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
so folks I ask you this is a
 
07:25:29.750 --> 07:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know if you don't if you pay your
 
07:25:31.968 --> 07:25:31.978 align:start position:0%
tolls you'll never have to worry about
 
07:25:31.978 --> 07:25:32.868 align:start position:0%

speaker Mr Speaker
 
07:33:27.830 --> 07:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
if I know

that this bill is going to
 
07:33:34.788 --> 07:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
accommodate businesses that are looking
 
07:33:37.968 --> 07:33:37.978 align:start position:0%
for regulation and if I
 
07:33:41.090 --> 07:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
believe that typically when businesses
 
07:33:43.850 --> 07:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
are looking to be regulated they're
 
07:33:46.730 --> 07:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
actually looking to prevent competition
 
07:33:48.590 --> 07:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
from moving into the market
 
07:33:50.810 --> 07:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
and if I believe those things then would
 
07:33:53.750 --> 07:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
I press the red button
 
07:33:55.190 --> 07:33:55.200 align:start position:0%

um Mr Speaker
 
07:34:10.448 --> 07:34:10.458 align:start position:0%
um if if if I knew that
 
07:34:12.590 --> 07:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:34:15.650 --> 07:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
stripped out all of the punitive
 
07:34:17.690 --> 07:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
portions of the bill
 
07:34:21.170 --> 07:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
but left intact the part that the
 
07:34:24.048 --> 07:34:24.058 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nurses wanted which was
 
07:34:26.628 --> 07:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
the statistical Gathering and Reporting
 
07:34:30.048 --> 07:34:30.058 align:start position:0%
and the periodic meeting if if I knew
 
07:34:33.708 --> 07:34:33.718 align:start position:0%
those things remained as they requested
 
07:34:36.230 --> 07:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
but with no penalty for anyone not
 
07:34:38.930 --> 07:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
participating and if I knew that the
 
07:34:41.750 --> 07:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
state-run hospitals were stripped from
 
07:34:44.270 --> 07:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
this bill so there are no State costs
 
07:34:46.850 --> 07:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
associated with this would I go ahead
 
07:34:48.548 --> 07:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
and accept an extremely strong
 
07:34:50.990 --> 07:34:51.000 align:start position:0%

David and Goliath
 
07:41:25.070 --> 07:41:25.080 align:start position:0%

overcame All Odds and defeated the
 
07:41:29.750 --> 07:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
impossible foe
 
07:41:31.490 --> 07:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
I do give a hat tip and an

07:41:34.250 --> 07:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
Gladwell

and his book David and Goliath underdogs
 
07:41:42.048 --> 07:41:42.058 align:start position:0%
Misfits and the Art of battling Giants
 
07:41:44.510 --> 07:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
so who was this Goliath
 
07:41:47.090 --> 07:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
he was Goliath of gath
 
07:41:50.448 --> 07:41:50.458 align:start position:0%
he was truly a giant among men
 
07:41:53.690 --> 07:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
his height was six cubits in a span that
 
07:41:56.388 --> 07:41:56.398 align:start position:0%
is over nine feet tall
 
07:41:59.330 --> 07:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
Goliath was a warrior who wore a brass
 
07:42:01.670 --> 07:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
helmet that weighed 30 pounds
 
07:42:04.250 --> 07:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
he was protected by a brass a coat of
 
07:42:07.788 --> 07:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
brass rings that weighed 125 pounds he
 
07:42:10.010 --> 07:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
wore a brass armor to protect his legs
 
07:42:12.888 --> 07:42:12.898 align:start position:0%
and brassama to protect his Shins
 
07:42:15.230 --> 07:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
along with a sword and shield he carried
 
07:42:18.650 --> 07:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
a spear that was 14 feet long
 
07:42:21.170 --> 07:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
with a metal Point alone that weighed 15
 
07:42:21.180 --> 07:42:22.430 align:start position:0%
with a metal Point alone that weighed 15
pounds

07:42:22.430 --> 07:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
pounds
 
07:42:25.010 --> 07:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
all told the armor and weapons of
 
07:42:29.270 --> 07:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
Goliath weighed over 700 pounds
 
07:42:31.310 --> 07:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
so the story starts with the army of the
 
07:42:32.930 --> 07:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
Philistines and the army of the
 
07:42:35.510 --> 07:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
Israelites meeting in the valley of Eli
 
07:42:37.910 --> 07:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
both armies took positions on opposite
 
07:42:40.250 --> 07:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
Mountain sides because both of them were
 
07:42:42.048 --> 07:42:42.058 align:start position:0%
smart enough to know you always want to
 
07:42:43.610 --> 07:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
take The High Ground
 
07:42:46.310 --> 07:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
neela Army would risk leaving The High
 
07:42:48.048 --> 07:42:48.058 align:start position:0%
Ground to attack the other
 
07:42:50.388 --> 07:42:50.398 align:start position:0%
so for weeks the mighty Goliath would go
 
07:42:51.590 --> 07:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
down to the valley
 
07:42:54.530 --> 07:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
every morning and every evening and he
 
07:42:56.930 --> 07:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
would taunt the Israelites to send out
 
07:42:59.448 --> 07:42:59.458 align:start position:0%
their Champion to decide the battle's
 
07:43:02.570 --> 07:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
outcome in a single Mortal Combat
 
07:43:06.410 --> 07:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
Goliath might have had one weakness he
 
07:43:09.708 --> 07:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
might have suffered from acromegaly
 
07:43:12.288 --> 07:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
that is a disorder that causes massive
 
07:43:15.048 --> 07:43:15.058 align:start position:0%
bodily growth and can also bring about
 
07:43:17.208 --> 07:43:17.218 align:start position:0%
very poor eyesight
 
07:43:19.788 --> 07:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
the professional wrestler Andre the
 
07:43:23.208 --> 07:43:23.218 align:start position:0%
Giant suffered from agromegaly
 
07:43:25.430 --> 07:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
no Israelite would volunteer to fight
 
07:43:28.670 --> 07:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
the Goliath in their right Minds no one
 
07:43:31.310 --> 07:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
that is until David stepped forward and
 
07:43:33.888 --> 07:43:33.898 align:start position:0%
who was David David was just a poor
 
07:43:36.410 --> 07:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
little Shepherd boy now the job of a
 
07:43:38.750 --> 07:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
Shepherd was to protect his flock
 
07:43:41.570 --> 07:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
and they Protected Their flocks from
 
07:43:41.580 --> 07:43:43.128 align:start position:0%
and they Protected Their flocks from
wolves

07:43:43.128 --> 07:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
wolves
 
07:43:44.868 --> 07:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
and they Protected Their flock from
 
07:43:47.510 --> 07:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
wolves by using a sling
 
07:43:50.090 --> 07:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
not a slingshot but a sling
 
07:43:52.730 --> 07:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
it has been calculated that a rock slung
 
07:43:55.490 --> 07:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
from a sling had the stopping power of a
 
07:43:57.708 --> 07:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
45 caliber bullet
 
07:44:00.530 --> 07:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
with their sling Shepherds could kill a
 
07:44:03.770 --> 07:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
wolf from 50 yards
 
07:44:06.530 --> 07:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
as a side note Julius Caesar's Legions
 
07:44:09.170 --> 07:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
had battalions of slingers
 
07:44:11.270 --> 07:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
who could bring Mayhem and death to
 
07:44:15.288 --> 07:44:15.298 align:start position:0%
their enemies from over 100 yards away
 
07:44:17.208 --> 07:44:17.218 align:start position:0%
and that reminds me virtual of the time
 
07:44:20.270 --> 07:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
a couple of Roman soldiers very thirsty
 
07:44:23.628 --> 07:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
looking for some beer walked into a bar
 
07:44:27.410 --> 07:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
and said bartender five beers
 
07:44:29.388 --> 07:44:29.398 align:start position:0%
but I digress
 
07:44:31.548 --> 07:44:31.558 align:start position:0%
it is written that on that fateful day
 
07:44:33.770 --> 07:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
Goliath was led down the mountain to the
 
07:44:34.968 --> 07:44:34.978 align:start position:0%
valley floor
 
07:44:38.270 --> 07:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps Goliath the giant had to be led
 
07:44:40.310 --> 07:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
down the mountain because of his very
 
07:44:41.930 --> 07:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
poor eyesight
 
07:44:44.030 --> 07:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
David started down the mountain carrying
 
07:44:46.730 --> 07:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
only his Shepherd's staff some locks in
 
07:44:49.190 --> 07:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
his pouch and his slang
 
07:44:51.288 --> 07:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
as David came down to the valley floor
 
07:44:54.830 --> 07:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
Goliath seemed abubous to the fact that
 
07:44:56.930 --> 07:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
David did not wear any armor
 
07:44:59.990 --> 07:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
do not carry a sword did not carry a
 
07:45:00.000 --> 07:45:00.948 align:start position:0%
do not carry a sword did not carry a
shield

07:45:00.948 --> 07:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
shield
 
07:45:04.430 --> 07:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
and Goliath said am I a dog that you
 
07:45:07.128 --> 07:45:07.138 align:start position:0%
would come to me with sticks perhaps his
 
07:45:09.830 --> 07:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
eyesight was so poor he confused the

07:45:13.610 --> 07:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
sticks
 
07:45:15.770 --> 07:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
because of Goliath's poor eyesight he
 
07:45:18.650 --> 07:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
couldn't see what David was Goliath said
 
07:45:20.208 --> 07:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
come to me
 
07:45:22.788 --> 07:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
come to me so that I may feed your flesh
 
07:45:25.128 --> 07:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
to the birds of the heavens and the
 
07:45:26.868 --> 07:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
Beast of the fields
 
07:45:29.570 --> 07:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
Goliath was telling David to come close
 
07:45:32.510 --> 07:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
I can't see where you are come close so
 
07:45:36.230 --> 07:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
we can fight and I can kill you quickly
 
07:45:39.230 --> 07:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
but David never had any intention of
 
07:45:41.810 --> 07:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
getting anywhere near Goliath
 
07:45:45.288 --> 07:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
from 10 to 20 yards away David wound up
 
07:45:48.048 --> 07:45:48.058 align:start position:0%
his sling released the lock and hit the
 
07:45:50.570 --> 07:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
giant smack in the forehead killing
 
07:45:50.580 --> 07:45:52.730 align:start position:0%

Goliath

07:45:52.730 --> 07:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
Goliath
 
07:45:54.770 --> 07:45:54.780 align:start position:0%

story

07:45:55.670 --> 07:45:55.680 align:start position:0%

07:45:57.170 --> 07:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
about David
 
07:45:59.208 --> 07:45:59.218 align:start position:0%
the poor little Shepherd boy
 
07:46:02.090 --> 07:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
who overcame All Odds and defeated the
 
07:46:04.850 --> 07:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
impossible foe perhaps you will think to
 
07:46:04.860 --> 07:46:05.628 align:start position:0%
impossible foe perhaps you will think to
yourself

07:46:05.628 --> 07:46:05.638 align:start position:0%

wait a minute
 
07:46:10.070 --> 07:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
David wasn't the underdog
 
07:46:12.430 --> 07:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
Goliath was the underdog
 
07:46:15.650 --> 07:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
never even saw what hit him
 
07:46:18.770 --> 07:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
Goliath never stood a chance
 
07:46:21.830 --> 07:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
and now you know the rest of the story
