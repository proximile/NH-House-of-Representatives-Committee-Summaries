1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Okay, good morning everybody.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.500
We're ready to go ahead with this first of eight community conferences to be held in this room today or elsewhere as well.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.000
And so we got to stick to this schedule that we have in front of us here.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This first bill is HB 1195.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.500
This is apportionment methods for school administrative unit costs.

9
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:44.000
And so I'd like to open it up to discussion from the seven members that are here.

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We are being streamed, so when we speak, we've got to make sure our red lights are on.

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So anybody up for discussion here?

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.500
We have two perspectives here.

13
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.000
There is the side-by-side, 1195.

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You can see the left-hand side being the House version and the right-hand side being the Senate version.

15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The differences are referencing different areas of statute.

16
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.500
RSA 194C2 is the House version and 194C9 and C9A are the references in the Senate version.

17
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.000
One reference is more organization and structure.

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The other side, alternative and budgetary type references.

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yes, Representative Cordelli.

20
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Thank you.

21
00:01:34.000 --> 00:02:07.500
The issue I see with the Senate version, which refers to C-9 and C-9A, is that the vote is based on the cumulative votes within the entire SAU so that a larger district within the SAU can outvote all the rest of the districts within that SAU, which is the age-old problem that we've wrestled with for a number of terms in terms of SAUs and co-ops.

22
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:23.500
So I think that that is the problem there, and I'm trying to double-check in the House version how the voting works, because that refers to a different section, just C2, 194C2.

23
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:47.000
But there was the possibility of adding to the Senate version a sentence that the proposed method of apportionment would be adopted only if there's a majority affirmative vote in each school district, which I think eliminates the majority, the larger district majority vote as an issue.

24
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Further comments?

25
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Sure.

26
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So thank you very much, Mr.

27
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Chair.

28
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And sort of a question to the Chair and to the committee.

29
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Are there really sort of two actions that would have to be taken, one of them being the apportionment of the SAU costs and how that apportionment would go into the budget and affect the individual members of the SAU?

30
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.500
then part two, approval by the by the SAU member districts of of their of their budgets.

31
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.500
So are there two steps to this, or am I missing that?

32
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:48.500
From my perspective, we're referencing that singular statute, which is the methodology of apportionment for the structure of the school cooperative or district, SAU.

33
00:03:48.500 --> 00:04:18.000
I see that we're looking at two different things here in this, and I think the basic intent, as I believe the bill came, I was not prime sponsor or sponsor this thing, but it was we've had this age old issue of the small districts not having any control when it comes to apportionment and how they're working.

34
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.500
And we were trying to support the smaller district and ensure that their vote mattered.

35
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.500
Representative Damon.

36
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.500
Thank you, Mr.

37
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.500
Chair.

38
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.500
Good morning, everyone.

39
00:04:33.500 --> 00:05:12.500
So, I concur with what the Chair just said, that the intent of the bill was to respect the smaller districts but i think this doesn't accomplish that it um in the senate version at least it would seem very very likely that the majority vote would be with the largest district and they would always prevail over the smaller population town so it doesn't solve what was being addressed to be solved or attempted to be solved.

40
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.500
Mr.

41
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.500
Chair, can I?

42
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.500
Yes.

43
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:27.000
So again, I'm trying to read through C2 here and see where the voting process actually occurs.

44
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And it looks like it's under Section H.

45
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:50.500
And in Section H, it says, and the reason I think we reference Section 2 for this is that under Section 8, if three-fifths of the votes cast on the question in each district shall vote in the affirmative.

46
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.500
Right?

47
00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:04.000
So again, that is a definitive by district versus an entire board, you know, the whole multiple districts combined voting in the affirmative.

48
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:18.500
So I think that was the intent of why we ended up changing that was because under Section H, you have to have 60 percent vote of each district.

49
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.500
If any one district says no, then the question fails.

50
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.500
Representative Cordelli?

51
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.500
Yes, I think that's correct, Senator.

52
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.500
And in my mind, the three-fifths is a problem in that regard.

53
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:42.500
And this section was really related to organization of the SAU rather than apportionment, I believe.

54
00:06:42.500 --> 00:07:02.000
Because section Roman 2, under H is under Roman two it talks about it uh establishing a planning committee and so forth um and specifically for organization of the SAU I think that's what I mentioned organization as well.

55
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Yeah.

56
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Further discussion.

57
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Yes.

58
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I'm just looking at the title of the bill here.

59
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
You need to approve a different method of the portioning.

60
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:35.500
So it seems to me if we're talking about whether the whole district should vote as one or whether you should have individual parts of the district to vote individually and then collect the votes.

61
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:43.500
So I think that it's already included that there is you can do it either way.

62
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.000
Go get my statute book.

63
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Yeah.

64
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Yeah.

65
00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:23.000
If anyone has the statute book yeah um yeah on if anyone has the statute book i'm not it's um on page 635 it's uh c9a roman 3 if you're looking online um but it says if a majority of the voters voting in the school districts within the school administrative unit approve the question, then the provisions shall govern the adopting of the SAU budget.

66
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So I think right there it's saying that it's the cumulative voters of all the districts.

67
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.500
Glenn, can you give me that statute number again?

68
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.500
Yeah, it's C9A, Roman 3, and it's halfway down in Roman 3.

69
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:48.000
It starts with if a majority of the voters voting in school districts.

70
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Right.

71
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So this goes.

72
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Let me reread that.

73
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:07.500
So, Glenn, is it your contention that under Roman 3, this is a cumulative of the whole, all the districts combined and a majority vote of that?

74
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.500
Yeah.

75
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.500
But again, so I think versus having it be within each district.

76
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.500
Right.

77
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.500
It's cumulative.

78
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.500
Right.

79
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:44.500
So I think if we add a sentence onto the Senate version to the effect that pursuant to C9 and C9A, accept that the proposed method of apportionment shall be adopted only if there is a majority affirmative vote in each school district within the SAU.

80
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.000
You have written copies of that sentence?

81
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Yeah, one.

82
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.500
Jen, could you please make a copy of the sheet that he has?

83
00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.000
We need to have six additional copies.

84
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Make it ten, please.

85
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Mr.

86
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Chair.

87
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Yes, while we're doing that, could you summarize how it's currently being, how current law applies?

88
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
No.

89
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
No?

90
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Okay.

91
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Can you?

92
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
No, I mean, or I can't.

93
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.500
So perhaps Representative Cordelli could summarize how current law applies in this case.

94
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:41.000
I think if we're looking at apportionment, I think C9A talks about the alternative procedure and methods of adoption.

95
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And so I think that under Roman III, current law would have the majority of voters within the entire SAU determining any re-apportionment method.

96
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.500
As opposed to by the member districts?

97
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.500
Correct.

98
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.500
Perhaps representing fellows.

99
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:07.000
Well, I want to really keep it to the right here right now.

100
00:11:07.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So again so again if i may so again if as i read the apportionment method under nine right for the budget on on your education hymnal it's page 634 about halfway down it says the school administrative unit board shall apportion the total amount of budget among the constituent school districts in the following manner the apportionment shall be based on one half average daily membership in attendance for the previous year and one half of the most recently available equalized valuation so again that's the if they want to adopt anything different than that this is what we're talking about how they go about doing something different than this apportionment.

101
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.500
I think that's correct, Senator.

102
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.500
Well, that's statute right now, yeah.

103
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:16.000
So we have the paperwork in front of us that has represented Cordellis suggested language.

104
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Um.

105
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:31.500
Except that the proposed method of apportionment shall be adopted only if there is a majority affirmative vote in each school district within the school administrative unit.

106
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.500
Mr.

107
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.500
Chair, yes, we ask for just a 2 minute recess.

108
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.500
Sure, Senate.

109
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.500
You meet real quick.

110
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.500
Yeah.

111
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:52.000
All right, you can use the office and we're going to do the same thing.

112
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Here we got it.

113
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Thank you.

114
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Thank you.

115
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Thank you.

116
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Thank you.

117
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Thank you.

118
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Thank you.

119
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Thank you.

120
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Thank you.

121
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Thank you.

122
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Thank you.

123
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Thank you.

124
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Thank you.

125
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Thank you.

126
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Thank you.

127
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.500
We're back in session now.

128
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:38.000
We have a couple minutes left on this one, so I'd like to have Senator Ward, would you please speak to what your caucus came up with?

129
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.500
My caucus has come up with the...

130
00:13:41.500 --> 00:14:02.500
We will go with the senate version with the house amendment a slight change in the uh we'd like to have an or between the rsa 194 c9 and the rsa 94 c9 dash a other than that we'll find where that.

131
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.500
And I'll ask you the question.

132
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:13.500
The amending language, is that the amending language which is outlined here in front of us?

133
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.500
Yes.

134
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.500
Yes.

135
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.500
Yes.

136
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.500
OK.

137
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.500
Your exception here.

138
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.500
Yes, that's OK.

139
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:59.000
So yeah, again, so we'll accept the amendment you proposed with the additional sentence and we want to make just one minor change and just change that and to an or between the two rsas because they are two different methods we don't want to make sure people don't think it's a combined it's one or the other is there any comment from the outside on that?

140
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Oh, thank you.

141
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Okay, is there any further comment?

142
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:30.500
Is there perhaps it's time then to take a a vote as a caucus and see where hr sounds like we know where you are but okay um is there a need for to further any further discussion on this from our side uh i am okay with what the Senate is suggesting.

143
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.500
I am too.

144
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.000
Representative Leno and Representative Damon.

145
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:48.500
So, just in the scenarios we talked about, will this prevent, I guess I just want to make sure I understand the consequences of what this does.

146
00:15:48.500 --> 00:16:01.500
and particularly looking at the corner cases on this, not when everybody's in agreement, but when everybody's in agreement, but when there's disagreement in the apportionment.

147
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:40.000
So like we discussed, The SAU cost apportionment is created by the by the sau board and then it's brought to the to the member districts for an up down vote correct that's how i see it yes i agree okay so um so now each under under this um each member district would have to approve the um the sau budget or else the sau budget fit so you could have a small district, let's say.

148
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Can I answer that?

149
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Yes, Rick.

150
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:58.000
So again, the way I read this and from my practical experience on the school board is this is talking about the apportionment method, not the budget itself.

151
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
The apportionment method.

152
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:15.500
So I know in my school district, I happen to be in a cooperative school district, and we have to do apportionment every five years by our contract between the towns.

153
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:24.500
And so again, the idea behind this is that in SAU, we have multiple districts, the apportionment method.

154
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:45.500
So instead of using 50% attendance and 50% equalized valuation, if you're going to differentiate from that, change from that, any apportionment change has to be approved by all three towns that are in all three districts that are in the SAU.

155
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.500
That's exactly how I see it.

156
00:17:48.500 --> 00:18:05.000
And so the intention is not to make it so a big SAU could change it in their benefit and have the small SAU pay a disproportionate share because they changed the apportionment.

157
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:16.000
This makes sure that everybody's in agreement, that everybody agrees by a 51 percent vote that this is a good apportionment method.

158
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:26.500
So it's not approving the apportioned SAU budget, but the method of apportioning the SAU budget for each of the members.

159
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.000
That's approved in the agreement between everybody.

160
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:40.500
And, you know, if they want to change it from a 50-50 to a 40-60, that may impact one town significantly.

161
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:48.000
And we've seen that in the North Country with one of our districts way up.

162
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And so above us.

163
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Yeah.

164
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.500
So it's about, again, it's not about the budget.

165
00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:02.500
It's about the apportionment of the budget to the districts, the formula.

166
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:10.500
So what would be the unintended consequences of having any one district veto an apportionment method?

167
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:20.500
You would end up back on the default apportionment method that they had prior until a new method is approved.

168
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.500
And would that be the 50-50?

169
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.500
Is that the default?

170
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:31.000
Well, it depends on whether they're under C9 or C9A, right?

171
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:45.000
So C9 is 50% of attendance, 50%, but C9A, which is what our district is under, is we have a different methodology and it has to be approved.

172
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
So it depends on which one you're on, but yeah.

173
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.500
Do we need a caucus, or are we good?

174
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.000
We've run out of time.

175
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Yeah, I'm good.

176
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Okay.

177
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Is the Senate good?

178
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
So let's take a vote from our side, Representative Damon.

179
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Yes.

180
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Cordelli, Vlad.

181
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Yes?

182
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Yes.

183
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Yes.

184
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Thank you.

185
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:31.000
So we'll get this language written up and out to everybody and I don't think just need to have to come back.

186
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
We've got it.

187
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Great.

188
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Thank you very much.

189
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Mr.

190
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.500
Chair, we'll have legislative services we'll send out final language to the conferees prior to sign off.

191
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.500
Oh, definitely.

192
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:56.000
And I've also got to contact our people over in the clerk's office.

193
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Okay, terrific.

194
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Thank you.

195
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
All righty.

196
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
So we've got a new cast of conferees.

197
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
So right now we're on 1695.

198
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.500
That's at least I don't think all our cast is here.

199
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.500
1695.

200
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.500
Bye.

201
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.500
No, no, you'll be.

202
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.500
1695.

203
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.000
No, no, you'll be sitting.

204
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.500
So we welcome to the committee represent Noble and represent Cascadden.

205
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.500
Thank you.

206
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.500
Thank you very much.

207
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.500
Here we go.

208
00:21:36.500 --> 00:22:06.500
And this bill is an act relative to the release of student personally identifiable information and the, I guess, the confusion that we have in the House is, can we please have explained to us within 14 school days before the release, you know, days of the release date, and the other is informed 14 school days before the release.

209
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:19.500
That's the hang up, and I don't think this should take a heck of a lot of time, but we're confused, Senator, And that's not usual.

210
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:34.500
I think having something within a certain length of time can always give you the option of going from one day within to five days within to nine days within.

211
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.500
If you specify 14 days before, that's much more definitive.

212
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.500
And that's what we're looking for.

213
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.500
Your up, Senator Cordelli.

214
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.500
Thank you.

215
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:54.500
I agree that that's more definitive, but really this is just an informational release to parents.

216
00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:07.000
There's no set action within the statute that the parent could take in relation to blocking release of the information because it's covered under FERPA.

217
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
So this is informational.

218
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:23.000
If the parent wants to go and complain to the district, I guess they can and ask for an explanation as to why the information is being released.

219
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.500
So I don't see a great deal of difference between within or before.

220
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.500
Good morning, represent Mike.

221
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:51.000
So again, I think the intention was on the Senate side is to give parents notice before the data's out, if they feel like taking action, it gives them the ability to do that, what action they can take.

222
00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Maybe just to, you know, I don't think you should be releasing my kid's data and complain, and that may be the only thing they do.

223
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:19.000
But doing it after the data is already released is kind of, you know, it doesn't give the school a chance to respond to the complaint if they want to.

224
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:41.000
And so the idea was to let a parent go in and complain, and then if they want to, because they know it's being released before the date, you know, again, this is horse out of the barn, horse still in the barn discussion.

225
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Are you good with the four?

226
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Yeah.

227
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Not yet.

228
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.500
Okay, we're not all there.

229
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:56.000
You've got to do a little more explaining for Representative Cascade.

230
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:11.500
Again, so the idea, my last statement, right, so the idea being that this is horse still in the barn before you've let it out versus horse out of the barn.

231
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:27.000
Now you're closing the barn doors after the fact with a parent making a request for clarification on why data is being released that they may not know is being released.

232
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
It gives some clarity.

233
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:50.500
It gives the district the chance of realizing they might have made a mistake and they're not going to release this data now because they've either got an uprising within the community saying, I don't want my kids data released for this purpose.

234
00:25:50.500 --> 00:26:07.000
Again, the idea being is that if you do it after the release, the parents really have no recourse other than protecting the parents of next year, but if they do it again.

235
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:20.000
But if you do it before the information is released, it gives parents and community a chance to respond before the data is cut, let loose.

236
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Because once, as you know, once you put something out there, you can't get it back.

237
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
So let me try to give a few thoughts to that, Senator.

238
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
So ours is saying within 14 school days.

239
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000
So it could be actually seven days or six days within that time frame.

240
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:55.500
You're saying that before that release, 14 days prior to the release of the data, that that has to be notified.

241
00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:14.500
So from my perspective right now, I agree with the Senate version that, you know, it could be a very short time that the parent has this information to deal with it the way we have it written.

242
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:48.500
So any concerns within 14 does not necessarily say before yeah the release it could also mean 14 days after the release yeah it doesn't specifically say so our intent was to say it's before you release the data at least 14 days to give time for the community to respond are you how's everybody with that one right now well i have some questions oh Oh, yeah.

243
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.500
I need something.

244
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.000
Why don't you use your red button, please, Corrie.

245
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Yeah.

246
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
I have some questions.

247
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Oh, yeah.

248
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I need something.

249
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.500
Why don't you use your red button, please, Corrine?

250
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.500
Yeah.

251
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:20.000
Sorry, I don't have an issue with either the House version or the Senate version in terms of the time frame.

252
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:29.000
What I'm struggling with is the language added to the law, and this is where I'm coming from.

253
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:49.500
In reading 189.68 and 189.67 on student privacy, I can't help but put my practitioner hat on and have been the result of many, many unfunded mandates in legislature that is required to be enacted in a school district or school.

254
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.000
And student records and student privacy is highly regarded.

255
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.500
I don't care if it's first party, second party, third party, fourth party.

256
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:08.000
And so I struggle with adding this language because it's already included in the process.

257
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.500
And I really need to know what is the real reason for this?

258
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.500
Am I missing something?

259
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:28.000
Because I've been on the end, receiving end of many mandates, particularly in 2018 when the data security and governance plans were initiated.

260
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Those required an enormous amount of time and are very detailed by their rights, as they should be.

261
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:53.500
And I'm just questioning why, what purpose, what does this language serve that is not already served by the current legislation and then in effect a school district is required to develop policy.

262
00:29:53.500 --> 00:30:07.500
And then by golly, you better follow those policies, and you better not release information unless there has been annual parent notification or written consent for individual process.

263
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:17.500
So I'm trying to wrap my head with, why do we have to add other language that is already covered?

264
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.000
I'm not understanding that part of it.

265
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
So somebody needs to help me with that.

266
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.500
Would we like to have the attorney from DOE?

267
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.500
Sure.

268
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.500
That's fine.

269
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.500
Okay, Diane.

270
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:41.000
We'll elevate you from a full colonel to a one-star general.

271
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.500
Okay, Attorney Fenton, you hear us asking about this issue right here between the two.

272
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:57.000
Do you have any thoughts on behalf of the department, whether this is needed or not needed?

273
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Good morning.

274
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:14.000
For the record, Diana Fenton of The department, so we have worked with Representative Cordelli on this bill, and I'm not, the department really doesn't take a position on this.

275
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.500
So I would really kind of defer to this legislative body.

276
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:26.500
And we have appreciated the ability to speak with Representative Cordelli about our concerns.

277
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:38.000
And I know that he took those to the Senate and address them with that legislative body to the best of his ability.

278
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:49.500
I think the department's position is simply neutral, and the concern that we raised with the representative was simply possible unforeseen collateral consequences.

279
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:55.500
And again, we appreciate his ability to take those to the Senate.

280
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.500
Thank you.

281
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.000
Any questions for the attorney?

282
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Thank you very much.

283
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.500
So the ball's back in our court.

284
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.000
Representative Cordelli, do you have any comments?

285
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Yes.

286
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:20.500
Just as indicated in one, some of the release of this information under certain conditions is allowed under FERPA.

287
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:31.000
And so this was an attempt to comply with FERPA, but also to let parents know that information was being released.

288
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
That was the intent.

289
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:46.500
and in terms of the actual issue at hand, in terms of the Senate version and the House version, I have no problem with the Senate version.

290
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.500
Okay, any further?

291
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.500
Yes, Senator.

292
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:55.500
The whole bill deals with the transferring of student data.

293
00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:05.000
And all we are asking is that the student let the parents know that the data is being transferred.

294
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:14.500
And all we're asking that be done before a certain date, like 14 days before you send it out.

295
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:27.500
So if the parents feel there's a need for clarification or anything else, that they have an opportunity to do so before the information goes out.

296
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:50.500
How does that work when we're working with the College Board and the SAT, and we're allowing the SAT to direct the College Board to directly mail this information to the address of the individual parents, and that's information they have to garner from the DOE.

297
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:58.000
Does that have to occur each time we do this with these students or not?

298
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Representative Crudeli?

299
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:08.000
We assume that you have a written consent to transfer the information to the third party.

300
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Again, I just say.

301
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Giving the state of technology now being a technologist, this is not a heavy lift, right?

302
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
This is not.

303
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
This is a form letter with a mail merge, right?

304
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
This is not a heavy lift for a school district.

305
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:42.500
And again, I think in the effort of keeping a parent informed of where their child's information is going, having that this notification is important.

306
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.500
Further discussion?

307
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:54.500
Okay, what we're going to do is we're going to just take a short caucus here and be back in.

308
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.500
I have to be going it.

309
00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

310
00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:04.500
I mean, take 10, but I think it's a 1030.

311
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.000
So I want you back.

312
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
No, I have three bills in a row.

313
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
10, 1030.

314
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Thank you.

315
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Thank you.

316
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Thank you.

317
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Thank you.

318
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Thank you.

319
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Thank you.

320
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Thank you.

321
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Thank you.

322
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Thank you.

323
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:53.000
In looking at, we're looking at the Senate version, and we're looking at, if you have the side-by-side, we're looking at section two there where it says, if student personally identifiable data is released to a third party, parents of students shall be informed.

324
00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:12.500
we would strike 14 school days in a timely manner before the release date to whom the data is released, what information is released or to be released, and the education purpose for which the information will be used.

325
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:19.000
So we see some tenses in the verb of being, and is incorrect.

326
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:56.500
And so we say in a timely manner, that means they're gonna have to do it, and if they don't, then they're gonna get slapped pretty hard by the commissioner that's a timely matter is very subjective yeah you know what it's timely to me may not be to somebody else and i think that's the risk that we're trying to avoid so rick can you read what your changes again what you're looking for?

327
00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:16.000
On part two there, if student personally identifiable data is released to a third party, parents of the student shall be informed in a timely manner before the release date to whom the data is released, not was released.

328
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
what information uh uh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

329
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:29.000
So I guess, again, to Senator Ward's point, the problem with a timely manner is so subjective to based on who's answering.

330
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.500
I guess it's a day before timely.

331
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.000
It's before I did it.

332
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
I sent it out.

333
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.500
Is that a reasonable number?

334
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:44.000
Is 30 days a reasonable number for somebody else?

335
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.500
It's one of the reasons why we put it.

336
00:37:48.500 --> 00:38:28.000
You know, again, I think think only thing we did was change from the house version to us is we just you know inserted before instead of within the most important part to us is that the parent be notified right and uh we're we want to see if this would work uh if in fact the if if it's not, this needs to be reported to the DOE, to the commissioner, and somebody needs, quote, their hands slapped.

337
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.000
So we'd like to try to do this if we could make the changes initially here.

338
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
And if this doesn't work, then to go to the next step.

339
00:38:42.000 --> 00:39:51.500
I think our point was we just wanted to create a minimum window of time before the release of the data that parents get notified right rather than have it be subjective so it's a definitive it doesn't matter if they do it 30 days before as long as they're within a window of time that gives parents the opportunity to say something if they want to say something so I'm not sure that in your question again if I released the data one day before if I give a notice send a notice home with my child one day before the release of the data there's no time for a parent to respond would some um informed uh at least x number of days prior to the release acceptable, at least seven school days prior, something like that.

340
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:55.000
So you just want to change it.

341
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:09.000
So again, on the line under the Senate version, besides the is and the was, just change it to 14 to seven days and form seven days prior.

342
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000
At least seven days so that you have that minimum that you're looking for.

343
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.500
So it's OK with that.

344
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.500
I'm OK with that.

345
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.000
Are we OK with that?

346
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.500
Are we OK with that?

347
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.500
Thank you.

348
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:38.500
So I think we're at the point then where we're at the point where we're going to have to move forward here.

349
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.500
With language so.

350
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:50.000
We're going to have to go ahead then and we're going to just caucus briefly for 30 seconds here.

351
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.500
We're going to have to go ahead then and.

352
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:59.500
We're going to just caucus briefly for 30 seconds here.

353
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.500
We have the thing over there.

354
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.500
It's on the clock.

355
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.500
Yeah, I know it.

356
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.500
So we'll be back and just.

357
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:14.000
When the red hand gets up in the 12th.

358
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
6.

359
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
in the 12th you Thank you.

360
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
The House is willing to accede to the Senate version.

361
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Would the amendment to change the was is to is?

362
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.500
So there'd be two changes.

363
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:36.000
And from the House side, we'll take a vote.

364
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Reps and Noble.

365
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.500
Yes, represent yes, represent lag.

366
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.500
Yes, yes, yes.

367
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:48.000
She's gonna be OK so so that concludes what we are.

368
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:56.500
We'll get the was is changed to is now we're all running over to state house 100.

369
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.000
Yes, it was a meeting.

370
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000

Thank you.

493
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Thank you.

494
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Thank you.

495
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Thank you.

496
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Thank you.

497
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Thank you.

498
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Thank you.

499
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Thank you.

500
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Thank you.

501
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Thank you.

502
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Thank you.

503
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Thank you.

504
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Thank you.

505
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Thank you.

506
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Thank you.

507
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Thank you.

508
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Thank you.

509
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Thank you.

510
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Thank you.

511
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Thank you.

512
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Thank you.

513
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Thank you.

514
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Thank you.

515
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Thank you.

516
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Thank you.

517
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Thank you.

518
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Thank you.

519
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Thank you.

520
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Thank you.

521
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Thank you.

522
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Thank you.

523
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Thank you.

524
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Thank you.

525
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Thank you.

526
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Thank you.

527
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Thank you.

528
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Thank you.

529
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Thank you.

530
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Thank you.

531
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Thank you.

532
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Thank you.

533
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Thank you.

534
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Thank you.

535
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Thank you.

536
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Thank you.

537
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Thank you.

538
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Thank you.

539
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Thank you.

540
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Thank you.

541
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Thank you.

542
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Thank you.

543
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Thank you.

544
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Thank you.

545
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Thank you.

546
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Thank you.

547
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Thank you.

548
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Thank you.

549
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Thank you.

550
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Thank you.

551
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.500
We're going to have a conference committee on House Bill 1278.

552
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:22.500
House Bill 1278 is a therapeutic cannabis bill so that we can get beyond having to approve indication by indication for expanding the ability of providers to write certifications for therapeutic cannabis.

553
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:32.000
This program is one that is now moving towards a more mature stage than when it was initially created.

554
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:48.000
And as we potentially move to Schedule 3 classification, that will change from the current status with Schedule 1, and it should be treated more like other things that providers can provide.

555
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:57.500
It also has three of the sections from what I like to call the smorgasbord of Feed Our Kids.

556
00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:04.000
There were a lot of different provisions that the Senate initially put forward.

557
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.500
There are only two that had been supported by the House.

558
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:18.000
With that, there's an additional third section that was added by the Senate when this was amended.

559
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.500
The Senate Bill 499, which is the Feed Our Kids, is also alive.

560
00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:39.000
It has another part, which is a provision to allow towns to get some funding in an emergency right away and not have to wait for the federal government.

561
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
That one is still in process and still in play.

562
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
It looks quite optimistic.

563
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:59.500
But my biggest question now would be, regardless of what happens with 499, is the Senate 100% committed to keeping the language in paragraph 3 of 1278?

564
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:06.000
That is the one that adds into the school's food and nutrition programs.

565
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:20.500
One that quite frankly takes quite a bit of research to understand the implications and was not accepted in either of the amendments that came out of House Finance.

566
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:27.000
Section 3 of the bill, it's on page 1, lines 10 through 21.

567
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:46.000
So that is what's different different between 499 as attached to this bill and 499 as passed by the house can we have a one minute break yes so we'll be in recess for one minute Thank you.

568
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Thank you.

569
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
And we are back for House Bill 1278.

570
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Do you want any?

571
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Sure.

572
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:09.500
I think our position at this point is that, you know, it's all part of the conversation, particularly with 499 and the ongoing conversations with disaster relief.

573
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:23.000
So I think at this point, the Senate would be most comfortable just recessing this bill and coming back tomorrow after the committee of conference on 499.

574
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000
And then it will be all part of that conversation.

575
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000
I think that's sort of where we're at.

576
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Okay, thank you.

577
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:57.000
I'm just trying to understand what conversation we'll be having if the Senate, if we end up passing 499 with both sections, which is what I believe, with both sections in some form, which is what I believe would need to happen for 499 to pass.

578
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:08.000
If that passes, would the Senate be willing to recede from their amendment and accede to the House position on this bill?

579
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:20.000
So I haven't had a chance to go to any of the 499 committees of conference because I've had a couple of things scheduled.

580
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:28.500
So my understanding is that the disaster relief changes the law that we just passed in 2022.

581
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:45.500
That being said, I think what we saw with the flooding in the seacoast this year and the slow response of getting a FEMA declaration, that there some merit to what is being proposed.

582
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.000
The question is the amount.

583
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.500
And I think that that's under discussion.

584
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:59.500
So just like that's under discussion, you know, free and reduced lunch should be under discussion.

585
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:05.000
Hopefully we can roll this all together where everybody leaves happy.

586
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.500
Nobody gets everything, but we have a compromise that we can pass both of these.

587
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:14.500
Okay?

588
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.500
Thank you.

589
00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:21.500
So I'm not saying yes and I'm not saying no.

590
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:39.500
So you're saying that, assuming that Senate Bill 499 is passed, perhaps with the $50,000 amount that helps the Seacoast, helps the North Country, helps our communities when, because the federal government's too slow to act.

591
00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:48.500
Assuming that that passes, you still will be looking to have all three items from the school lunch.

592
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.500
Oh, your microphone's off.

593
00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:59.000
It all gets wrapped in to the same discussion, okay, of what a good compromise looks like.

594
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Thank you.

595
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
I appreciate that.

596
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:18.500
I also appreciate that my job here isn't necessarily to have my position, but to represent the position of the House, and the position of the House is those two items.

597
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:29.000
Well, and remember, the Senate killed the disaster relief bill because we had just passed something a couple of years ago.

598
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Thank you.

599
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
I recognize that.

600
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Unfortunately, it seems that what we passed a few years ago still needs some more change.

601
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.500
And I also recognize how busy we've all been this year.

602
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:50.000
We all put in too many bills.

603
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000
I know I'm guilty of that.

604
00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:01.500
And I know that that led to a lot of the challenges we're dealing with right now.

605
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:09.000
I guess we'll recess until 3 o'clock tomorrow, but we'll recess until 3 o'clock tomorrow.

606
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Thank you.

607
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.500
Sorry, can you be there at 3 o'clock tomorrow?

608
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.500
I apologize.

609
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:22.000
Sorry, Senator Whitley had suggested that as a time.

610
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
I forgot to check it with the rest of you.

611
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.500
I know Senator Bradley and Senator Abarth are also very busy.

612
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.500
Right now, yes.

613
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.500
Okay.

614
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.500
If I can't be here, Okay.

615
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.500
Okay.

616
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.500
Okay.

617
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.500
Okay.

618
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.500
Okay.

619
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.500
Okay.

620
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.500
Okay.

621
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.500
Okay.

622
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.500
Okay.

623
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.500
Okay.

624
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.500
Okay.

625
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.500
Okay.

626
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.500
Okay.

627
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:12.500
okay okay if you'll make it work we'll recess this until three o'clock tomorrow thank you Thank you.

628
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.500
Thank you.
