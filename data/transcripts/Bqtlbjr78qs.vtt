I'd like to make a motion to itl House
Bill

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
1326 do we want to second
 
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
itk thank you Mr
 
00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
chair yes um during uh testimony we
 
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
heard that um these permits are
 
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
primarily requested by municip ities um
 
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
the permitting process is already
 
00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
expensive $2 to
 
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
$300,000 and there is a concern that
 
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
this would increase the cost and delays
 
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
further and it might um and that while
 
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
newspapers paper newspapers papers are
 
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
not as prevalent as they once were they
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
have an online presence that's often
 
00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 align:start position:0%
linked uh to social media and spreads
 
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
rapidly to social media as as uh as
 
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
evidenced by the fact that a recent
 
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
hearing for uh one of these permits over
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
there was over a 100 attendees so I I
 
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this um bill is is
 
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
necessary and I think that it could add
 
00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
cost to municipalities thank you so I
 
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote i' heel thank
 
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
you repres representative Dunn would you
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
speak on the
 
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.230 align:start position:0%
speak on the
motion

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
uh I will be voting against the motion
 
00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
as the
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
chair uh I feel that uh there are there
 
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
were two amendments brought to
 
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
this committee that I think we should be
 
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
discussing uh the uh I think that that
 
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
that those amendments make the uh make
 
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
palatable and so uh I will be voting
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
against the I motion uh anyone else wish
 
00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 align:start position:0%
to speak to the speak to the
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
motion representative
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
mchu thank thank you Mr chairman in the
 
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
interest of transparency I I agree with
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
you that notification is generally a
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
good thing the Amendments specified
 
00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 align:start position:0%
economical way to do that with a
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
postcard and a smaller radius so I'll be
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to speak to the
 
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
motion representative Rong I I support
 
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
the itl because in the testimony and
 
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
even in with the Amendments I think the
 
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
greater concern is just getting the
 
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
public to go to meetings and I don't
 
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
think a postcard is going to do it I
 
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
just look in my experience in miramac
 
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
we're lucky if we get more people at our
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
deliberative session which is very well
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
communicated get more people there than
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
the people who have to be there so I
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
don't think um this notification is
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to uh bring more people into the
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
process a process that's already
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
established by Dees a process that's
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
already established by the
 
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities um to have people come
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
earlier in the process during the
 
00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
planning board um you know review of the
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
project so I I just think this is
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
unnecessary I think it adds expenses
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
onto the businesses that want to bring
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
the project forward and I think it's
 
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 align:start position:0%
redundant with the existing public
 
00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 align:start position:0%
hearing and notification system that
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
communities already have in place thank
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to speak to the
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
motion repres representative harb thank
 
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
you I'll make my comments brief I was
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
always concerned and even with the
 
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
Amendments that the bill is proposed and
 
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
as the Amendment states that there's no
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
statistical basis for the distance and
 
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh somebody's just making up the
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
distance I appreciate the representative
 
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh in his effort to clarify that and
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
narrow it down but he there's still I
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
don't see a basis for it so I will be
 
00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 align:start position:0%
supporting the uh itl thank
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%

within the state that were affected by
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%

inform the

clearcut wording in the Statue allowing
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920 align:start position:0%

announcement um put out electronic
 
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
messages to reduce the speed there was
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
never an attempt on this to find people
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
to be chasing them down Etc it was to
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
alert people what we ended up doing last
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
summer because the commissioner was not
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
sure whether he had the
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
authority we got the local police
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
departments that got their electronic
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
we put them out and I would say there
 
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
was a 90 plus per compliance and what we
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to go give give the department of
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%

this is a really critical um need and I
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%

process for when we have these
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
incredible storms in the aftermath in
 
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
order to help people clean up and
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
mitigate the damage that they've had we
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
need the damage to stop during that time
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
so that people can regroup so I am
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
really in support of a to pass as

speak on the oh repres representative
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
veale thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
to basically say that I think this is a
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
very well-intentioned bill um drinking
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
water and clean water is threatened and
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
groundwater is precious there is not as
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
much recycling as we would like and some
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the recycling causes plastic
 
00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:41.799 align:start position:0%
Ash however I will still need to support
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
the it on this bill because I think that
 
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
we learned there were too many issues um
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
some of them that have been raised in
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
the property taxes of
 
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
$27,000 to the town was something that
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
really stuck in in my mind I put it
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to speak to the
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
bill representative L
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
Monte I I I will be also voting it but I
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
do think the bill raised some issues
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
that I think it's true that we probably
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
drink too much water out of plastic
 
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.630 align:start position:0%
drink too much water out of plastic
bottles

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
bottles
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily but then again people who
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
are that lack clean and safe water do
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
need to be able to buy bottled water
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
and also for bottling companies many of
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
them not necessarily in this state but
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
they're actually using municipal water
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
sources not drilling new wells in order
 
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
to to bottle their water so I hope that
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
in the future if people want to oppose a
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
new Bottling Company and it's Municipal
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%

mchu thank you Mr chairman I'll move
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
inter room study on
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
1314 13
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
14 do we have a
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
second I'll second Mr chair second by
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
representative harb do you wish to speak
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
motion sure uh it's a good bill well
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
intended needs a little bit of work
 
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
there is an older development plan as
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
that we as we heard uh that we could uh
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
examine as well and not a lot has
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
happened with that so for now I think
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
the best thing to do is to hang on to
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
this bill study it over the summer and
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
improvements you wish to speak to the uh
 
00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.070 align:start position:0%
improvements you wish to speak to the uh
your

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:45.519 align:start position:0%
second no Mr chair I believe
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh set forth my
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
reasons for supporting interm study
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you okay anyone else wish to speak
 
00:29:55.389 --> 00:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
to the bill to speak to the motion
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
repres well I saw I was looking I saw
 
00:29:59.789 --> 00:29:59.799 align:start position:0%
representative rung first and
 
00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:00.830 align:start position:0%
representative rung first and
representative

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
Bale thank you very much Mr chair I'm
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
opposed to interim study and I'm going
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
to be voting against it the bill is very
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
straightforward I I don't really know
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
what we would study it it's just adding
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
two sections to existing statute one is
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
to include drink on if you have the bill
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
it's on line 27 it's just to add
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
drinking water aquifier identification
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
and protection protection of our Lake
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
Rivers estuaries Forest wetlands and
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
Shoreline Uplands Coastal marshlands
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitat and then it continues
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
about Farmland conservation which is
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
already existing and um adding in the um
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
on the last page of the bill on line 16
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
adding an environmental threats section
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
which identifies environmental threats
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
from chemical and biological
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
contamination waste disposal inadequate
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
recycling opportunities in order to
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
address the cumulative effects of
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
natural man-made contaminants on our air
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
Waters and land and to anticipate
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
possible future threats to our natural
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
environment this is so critically
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
important to me because had this bill
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
passed before um a chemical plant was
 
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
permitted in the town of
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
marac this language would have prevented
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
that the state plan could have outlined
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
areas where that type of manufacturing
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
was and was not acceptable it's a very
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
simple Bill I'm not going to come in in
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
the summer to debate these two minor uh
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
minor paragraphs I think it's really
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
important when we're doing a plan to
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
include the consideration of our water
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
and our air and the environment so I
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
encourage um my colleagues to vote
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
against the interim study so that um an
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
you well
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
first that's right represent that's I'm
 
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
sorry represent thank you Mr chair um I
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
Echo what representative rang shared um
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
I too will be voting against the interim
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
study I think this is an important bill
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
that there is guidance that people will
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
need to use um and you know many people
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
that live in New Hampshire and visit New
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire come here for the clean water
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
and it's really important to us to
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
address these Environmental
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
threats and to have this comprehensive
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
plan so that we can have a Common
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
Language across all of the Departments
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
that we are you know asking to mitigate
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
damage and to address environmental
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
concerns so I would like to as well see
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
a motion of aut to pass be brought
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
forward and again I'll be voting against
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
the interim study and I hope that others
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
me representative Harve Bia you wish to
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
speak to yes thank you Mr chair I will
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
be voting for the interim study um just
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
two things I I was involved in a lot M
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
to master plans and I studied how Master
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
plans are supposed to work seen
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
litigation about master planning in
 
00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:17.559 align:start position:0%
towns where as representative rang
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
brought up um she represent the
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh sort of touched upon
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
that if these regulations had been in
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
there then some sort of development
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
would have been prevented but you know
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding of Master plans is um
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
that you can't sort of legislate that
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
sort of thing if if we're following the
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
example of towns you know towns may say
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
that we want wish for a rural character
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
in our town um you can't use that then
 
00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
to keep out development so I think
 
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of misunderstanding
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
about what exactly this language is
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
going to do is can't and we still have
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
laws um which you know take precedence
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing also I saw some
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
outdated language in there um for the
 
00:34:07.869 --> 00:34:07.879 align:start position:0%
protection it's seeking to protect uh
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
Lakes that's a bit um outdated I have to
 
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
just say that um we're not we're going
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
the updated language is to mitigate
 
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
issues concerning lakes and waterways
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
but not to protect them from anything uh
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
the idea being that it's sort of you
 
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:28.389 align:start position:0%
the idea being that it's sort of you
can't

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
you know mitigation is is the gold
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
standard and it's the standard uh as
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to protection which is sort of
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
more of like an 80s term so I was hoping
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
to update that language a little bit
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
much

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.950 align:start position:0%
much
representative

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
wolf thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
representative rung uh alluded to the
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
fact that if this master plan had been
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
been in
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
place before the U construction of the
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
plant in maraman we wouldn't have had
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
this problem it's my understanding that
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
this plan has been in
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
effect for over 20 years and hasn't been
 
00:35:16.119 --> 00:35:17.670 align:start position:0%
effect for over 20 years and hasn't been
used

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
so I think we need to have interim study
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
to see how it's going to be used how
 
00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to prevent the issue that you
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
were talking about I think it was
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
written and it's been on the shelf for
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
years finish to respond representative R
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
representative will for bringing that up
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
this isn't a master plan as
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey buolo mentioned
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
it's not a tool of communities to use
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
for their Community it's really a
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
statement that the state makes about
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
what our PRI priorities as we're
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
developing um State resources how how
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
are we going to make that consideration
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm disappointed as well as I'm sure
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
the entire committee is is that it
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't been implemented or used it's
 
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
been collecting dust on the Shelf but I
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
think that's a separate issue I think
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that we take up with
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
state agencies that use this but I think
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
the content of that plan needs to
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
includes include these environmental
 
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.510 align:start position:0%
includes include these environmental
considerations

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative Derby thank you Mr chair
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
I just like to point out that this is
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
titled the comprehensive State
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
development plan and it seems to me that
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
um the state development plan if it's
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive can't it's it's lacking in
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
its comprehensiveness if it doesn't
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
include all our natural resources which
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
are critical to um our tourism trade our
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
many of our Industries and of course of
 
00:36:59.069 --> 00:36:59.079 align:start position:0%
course um in considering the natural
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
resources we have to consider the
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
threats to those and the threats to
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
human health as well and that's what
 
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
this um that's what this bill does is
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
add those sections for consideration to
 
00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.030 align:start position:0%
add those sections for consideration to
the

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um State development plan
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
so that the we can get guidance from the
 
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
state that can be shared to the um to
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
the communities and to others and to the
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
state departments in particular about
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
how to um how to estab how to PR how to
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
develop um guidance for developing um
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
resources um in a in a in a safe um
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
effective manner so I urge you to vote
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
itl on the um interim study so a better
 
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
motion can be made thank
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to speak
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative M thank you Mr chairman
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Darby and
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative rung for bringing up the
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive fact it is a comprehensive
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
of plan and it's probably one of the
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
most important plans that we need to
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
protect air and water in our communities
 
00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
so in that representative R and I
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
actually agree where we disagree is on
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
the Simplicity of the bill my concern is
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
how do we Define quote inadequate
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
recycling opportunities right what what
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
one community may find adequate another
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
community may find inadequate um we have
 
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
a a mixed stream recycling center in our
 
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
town and that might not be what another
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
town wants this bill asks for an entire
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
section on environmental
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
threats uh to identify environmental
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
threats I think that needs to be further
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
defined um it asks to anticipate future
 
00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
threats to our natural environment so
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
apparently there's a crystal ball that
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
has to go in here as well which is
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
difficult and that's perhaps why this
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive plan has sat on the shelf
 
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
for so long so there's a lot of issues
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
that we need to examine it needs to be
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
done in a thoughtful way to make sure we
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
get the best possible protections for
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
our communities and enable our
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
communities to take action to prevent
 
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
things like representative rman you
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
remember marac medals uh and our other
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
super fund site whose Name Escapes me
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
right now uh and of course our current
 
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
problem with that industry in the
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
northern end of our town so there's a
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
lot of issues here that we agree on but
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
I think we can all agree we need to get
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
it right and we can truly study it
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
improve this and bring back uh
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh in the in the near
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
term in in November of this
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
year so with that I would urge you to
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
support interim study um for the short
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
interum anyone else wishes to
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
speak representative
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
wol I would like to I am going to vote
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
for an N study and I think there should
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
be a SE added when we have major
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
developments that the the
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide development plan has been
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
referred to we have a thing in our
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
Master plans in town have you checked
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
with the police department have you
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
checked with the highway department have
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
you X Y and Z and I think any time that
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
there is a major
 
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
development somebody should read this
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
and acknowledge that they've read it so
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
part of my suggestion during inter study
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
and I I guess I just put myself on a
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
committee is to um see that it gets used
 
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
Shelf anyone else wish to
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
speak um I have a question or two uh did
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
you read the uh old master plan uh that
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh the the development plan that
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
out

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair I didn't go
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
through all of it I don't look at this
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
bill as really complicated it's just
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
adding some environmental factors into
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
the comprehensive plan I think some of
 
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
the ideas that representative wolf had
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
are very valid and if he wants to bring
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
a separate bill about that talks about
 
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
implementation and some other things I'd
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
be happy to co-sponsor that with you
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
this is just adding in environmental
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
considerations when the state has their
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
comprehensive plan um as far as
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
implementation responsibility anything
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
like that I think would have to be a
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
separate bill anyway and even with
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
interim study this bill isn't coming
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
back somebody still has to file it
 
00:41:48.319 --> 00:41:49.270 align:start position:0%
back somebody still has to file it
actually

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe he did hand anything
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
out no uh so uh I only watch this on
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
YouTube uh and as his he had a plan I
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
did he did did did anybody read it old
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
plan uh maybe it did but I I it was I
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
didn't get a copy uh oh Mr chair when um
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
before I signed on as co-sponsor I did
 
00:42:23.069 --> 00:42:23.079 align:start position:0%
skim a plan it is available yes but he
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
never handed it out did he and uh also
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh the if if in his testimony and I'm
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
not I'm testifying now I'm not or I'm
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
speaking not
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
questioning uh he didn't uh in his
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
testimony said he act actually there was
 
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
none at the State Library he found uh he
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
F actually found somebody I guess who
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
had a copy in stored away somewhere so
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
he found it in a junk drawer I guess
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
but the point is we're taking time and a
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
bill to discuss something that nobody
 
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
bothered to look at 25 years
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
ago and what's the definition of
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
insanity is doing the same doing the
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
same thing twice and expecting a
 
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.510 align:start position:0%
same thing twice and expecting a
different

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
result uh
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
putting this into this bill right now
 
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:31.510 align:start position:0%
putting this into this bill right now
you're

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
changing that we have an we have an
 
00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:34.950 align:start position:0%
changing that we have an we have an
Arcane

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
Arcane
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
statute right now that is not that has
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh made a uh that which a plan was
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
developed and the plan has been just
 
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.630 align:start position:0%
developed and the plan has been just
shoved

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
shoved
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
away why don't why this is like having
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
amending that part of the statute right
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
now is like putting new tires on a a
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
junk car in the
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
it's we're spending time on a statute
 
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
that is not going to be operable until
 
00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:09.559 align:start position:0%
maybe next year when he brings when he
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
when he said he would bring forth a bill
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
that would be the time to do this uh to
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
to do make this add addition to that
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill and not spend time and bring this
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
floor and had and debate it on something
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
that probably might not even become a
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill it's with this is premature so
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's my that's my
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
testimony you wish to speak just to
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
respond um I love the analogy putting
 
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
new cars on a junk car but I don't see
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
that this is a junk car if you look at
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
all of the things that are in existing
 
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
statute looking at natural Hazard
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
section recre ation section utility and
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
public service section there's some
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
really good things in here so I think
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
this is like putting new tires on a
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
great car but we need to find the keys
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
great enough debate anybody else I won't
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
debate any
 
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
longer said my piece but anyway nobody
 
00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:31.559 align:start position:0%
else wishes to speak on the motion
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%

1314
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%

excuse me representative
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
R going back and forth you wish to speak
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
to your motion I do thank you Mr chair
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
um we agree that this is an important
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
guidance document and that it was made
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
25 years ago with the best of intentions
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
in order to be a really important
 
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
document there are a broad swath of
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
areas in this um bill that and in this
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive plan that we definitely
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
need to update um I think over time the
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
last 25 years we've had a lot of
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminants and things to
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
address that section of the bill is
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
important to me um and we need to
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
respond to threats that we anticipate so
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
at the very least this will be
 
00:47:46.109 --> 00:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
educational and once again I think I
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
made the rest of the arguments when
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
against the the last motion uh thank you
 
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.710 align:start position:0%
against the the last motion uh thank you
Mr

00:47:58.349 --> 00:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
chair you wish to speak to your second
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
no I think I've said everything thank
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair okay representative
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
lante yes I think if um many of you
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to send this for interim study
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
you see some value in this bill and in
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
updating the the comprehensive State
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
development plan so an a toach motion is
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
just moving it forward so that the
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive development plan will be
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
updated and many of the things that we
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
think we need to study more will
 
00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
be worked out by the committee
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
developing this plan and it's time to
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
get the ball rolling on that so I urge
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
OTP anyone else wish to speak to the
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair my my baptism
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
into my first year as a state legislator
 
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
has come
 
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.549 align:start position:0%
has come
um

00:48:57.549 --> 00:48:57.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
primarily um about by people that are
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill in then central
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um the Lakes the rivers
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
the mountains the Lakes associations
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
like the sunap Lake Association Squam
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
Lakes Association I think we've heard um
 
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
that that the state Dees the state needs
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
to jump into the driver's seat here in
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
this very precarious time and and be
 
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
given a green light to to help lead uh
 
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the constituents
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
forward um given the Priceless nature of
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
our environment so it's not just about
 
00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
water you know clean water in Southern
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's about this
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar tourism industry
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's about um um I think it's about um
 
00:49:51.549 --> 00:49:51.559 align:start position:0%
supporting it's about dusting off an old
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
document that um perhaps has been put on
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
on the Shelf because the state hasn't
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
been given the green light hasn't been
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
given the resources to move ahead in
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
this really uh critical time with this
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
climate crisis that is affecting dams
 
00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
it's affecting so many aspects of our
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
environment so I hope we can vote to
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
pass this and move forward and to um put
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
some teeth and some energy into this
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
ecology representative harp thank you Mr
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
chair uh with the motion for interim
 
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
study failing I don't find that this
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill is harmful and we all certainly
 
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
support protecting our resources lakes
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
rivers so with the failing of the
 
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
interim study I will support this Bill
 
00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:43.990 align:start position:0%
interim study I will support this Bill
thank

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
motion representative Ryan I'll be
 
00:50:55.789 --> 00:50:55.799 align:start position:0%
voting to um support OTP if we we're not
 
00:50:58.990 --> 00:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
making the the forward motion to protect
 
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
what is most important to us in this
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
motion I probably shouldn't even say
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
this but I'll say it
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
anyway I will support the motion because
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
I can smell a political trap a long way
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
away and so I'll support it so you can't
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
beat me over the head with it that those
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
evil Republicans did not want to protect
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
the our our lakes and rivers so as an
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
evil Republican I will vote ought to
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
pass well a clerk representative who
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
Youk thank you Mr chairman for a morning
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
chuckle um I've noticed I'm not laughing
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
I I didn't have have it in my file um
 
00:51:58.789 --> 00:51:58.799 align:start position:0%
but I did have a look through the
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive plan and I will also be
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
supporting the motion of a to pass as a
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
baby step although I I I find it a
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
little shocking that even some of the
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
sponsors haven't read this plan so
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit uh shocking um and
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
there are some things that need to be
 
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
addressed the good news is there's at
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
least two committees before this bill is
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
signed into law so we can clarify things
 
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
like inadequate recycling opportunity
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
and possible future threats those are
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
all things that we need to address that
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
normally are thoughtfully addressed in a
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
study process we don't pass
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
educational legislation right that's not
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
the purpose we pass legislation that
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
does good that takes positive and
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
affirmative steps with specific
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
Direction and we'll get that done in the
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
next two committees but in the in the
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
interest of of of supporting clean air
 
00:52:52.789 --> 00:52:52.799 align:start position:0%
and clean water this is a this is a baby
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
yeah oh president you haven't spoken she
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
spoke go ahead yes thank I I hate to
 
00:53:10.589 --> 00:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
beat this up and but um it's one has to
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
look at the purpose of the bill in the I
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
mean the purpose of the development plan
 
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
to begin with um it wasn't was it was
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose to cover every aspect of our
 
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
life here as in New Hampshire because
 
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
you know there are a lot of threats that
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
could go in here what about the threat
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
of contagion or other human related
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
threats um you're you're isolating this
 
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
and and pointing out lakes and and
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
whatnot but there's there's a lot of you
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
could you could look at you could look
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
at this from any aspect but what was the
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of the development plan to begin
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
with um it's really behe it really
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
behooves to have the um planning the the
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
office of planning to get involved with
 
00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
this to see what's really
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate um obviously I second what
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
um representative rulu said if if this
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
comes back um I know that U Master plans
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
in towns cost about
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
$30,000 how much is this is a a very
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
large comprehensive plan like this that
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
encompasses all natural resources how
 
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
much is that going to cost that's quite
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
a bit so that's why I have a big
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
hesitation about this
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
R representative rung then
 
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
representative Derby thank you Mr chair
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
and I just want to get this on the
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
record I have tremendous respect and
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
fondness for you I hope you know that so
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
attributing motive that this would be
 
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
used politically I think is unfair thank
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Derby thank you Mr
 
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
chair just answering what the
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
comprehensive plan is about um it's
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
about uh helping the state um coordinate
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
across agencies to figure out um best
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
practices and where they should be
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
focusing their development efforts and
 
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
the environment is clear is clearly
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
crosscutting across all those areas and
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
so very applicable for the comprehensive
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
plan again this is not the master plan
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
right this just provides guidance on
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
what the equivalent of a master plan at
 
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
the state level should study so this the
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%
the the comments with respect to details
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
that need to be in here just just aren't
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
applicable that's what the office of uh
 
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
the you know um growth and uh
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
development or whatever that office is
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
is responsible for so thanks I
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%

consent it has a FN on it I don't think
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
it uh it has an indeterminate FN so I
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
Tod it's then determin
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
it actually what would having it debated
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
it all
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
right joh consent it's consent can can I
 
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
go on consent even with an indeterminate
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
actually uh if they'll they'll take it
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
required and Fin finally
 
00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
house 1440 we got oh 1440 okay yep I'm
 
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
sorry 1440 uh chair recognizes
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
buia and uh relative to establishing a
 
00:57:43.029 --> 00:57:43.039 align:start position:0%
life jacket loner station program along
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
the marac
 
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
river um yes thank you chair I am making
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
mon any just we like to speak to your
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
motion just briefly um thank you chair
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
is uh I have seen myself that um a lot
 
00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:17.559 align:start position:0%
of people they have been leaving life
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
jackets voluntarily along waterways like
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
near my hometown in Tilton in the samton
 
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.430 align:start position:0%
near my hometown in Tilton in the samton
area

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
I've seen this um people hang them up
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
and just says loner so um also the other
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
reason would be the cost of supplying
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
these and then having them get
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
stolen uh which I guess happens too so
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
you and representative lontine for the
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
second yes I think this bill was uh very
 
00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
well intentioned and I I found some of
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony from Safe Kids very moving
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
but it seemed that sponsor hadn't really
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
put in the time to figuring out how this
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
implemented um and you know it seemed a
 
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
lot to put on the department of
 
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
safety um so I hope that he brings a
 
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
bill back and and does a lot of work to
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
see how he could implement this program
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
um in a better Bill next
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.750 align:start position:0%
um in a better Bill next
year

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak representative
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
Bale thank you Mr chair um I Echo that
 
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
this is a well-intentioned bill and I my
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
heart really goes out when you're living
 
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
in a community where there are frequent
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
drownings in the mar Mack River you know
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
you're you're really looking at what the
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
solutions can be um we heard some
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
testimony that was really compelling and
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
during that time I was I I found myself
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
thinking that there could be a
 
00:59:54.839 --> 00:59:56.029 align:start position:0%
thinking that there could be a
non-legislative

non-legislative
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
solution and I like um representative
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
lontine feel that it would be wonderful
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
if he could work on that and and um
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
bring it back this is an important bill
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%

the last couple of speakers said but I
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
just want to mention that I think there
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
is um an appropriate place for the
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor to start engaging this is really
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
about injury prevention injury
 
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
prevention isn't um so much in the
 
01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
department of safeties um you know uh
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction as it is the Department of
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and that's why
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
they actually um came and testified on
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
this bill there is a there is a council
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
though Council on resources and
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
development that coordinates across
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
agencies for these sort of cross cutting
 
01:01:05.549 --> 01:01:05.559 align:start position:0%
purposes um one of the things that this
 
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
Council on resources and development is
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
jackets would go so I would encourage
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%

bring it up to the Council of resources
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
and development and see if they can
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
engage um not uh nonprofits in order to
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh to provide um this important measure

especially on the marac river which we
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
heard is one of the most dangerous in
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%

1483 is there a
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
second I second second by representative
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
bolia you wish to speak on your motion
 
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair uh I appreciate
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
the concern of this bill 1483 but in
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and reviewing the bill I felt
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
that uh perhaps this can already be
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
addressed by subdivision regulations and
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
I think it need needs a little more
 
01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
study uh to see how can it be
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
implemented and it can it already be
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
implemented before we pass the Bill
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you you wish to speak on your
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
second just briefly um yes I Echo uh
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative harb I think it's well
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
intentioned um after having served on
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
the planning board I can say that and
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
sitting through subdivision hearings
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
that people bring forward usually it's a
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
a giant engineering study that
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
accompanies a subdivision application
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
including these tests and um um I'm I'm
 
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that um people will keep in
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
mind that we have a housing crisis here
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
and additional regulations are uh often
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
not uh conducive with impr making
 
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
improvements to our housing crisis so
 
01:04:45.559 --> 01:04:46.390 align:start position:0%
improvements to our housing crisis so
thank

01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.430 align:start position:0%
motion repres representative
representative

01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
rung thank you Mr chair um I'm going to
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
vote against the interm study um so that
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
an ought to pass motion can come
 
01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
primarily because when I look at the
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
history of this issue we had a bill that
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
was brought up by a member of this
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
committee at the in 2019 representative
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
Hobson um and I believe representative
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
Mark Pearson was also involved in that
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
um because they had encountered a
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
subdivision in I believe it was in the
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
Kingston area that had um caused
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
neighboring dist uh neighboring homes to
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
have their Wells go dry and um and then
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that the sponsor of this
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
bill representative McGee had brought a
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
bill forth last year um it was if you
 
01:05:44.029 --> 01:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
remember it was introduced by
 
01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:45.269 align:start position:0%
remember it was introduced by
representative

01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
McWilliams that tried to uh approach
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
this issue as well um and the committee
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
ited that because it was going to
 
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
require a lot lot of extensive testing
 
01:05:58.510 --> 01:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
hydrologist things like that and the
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor took back that feedback from
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
this committee to bring this forward and
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is really just enabling legislation
 
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
if you look at the first um on line
 
01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
three it says requiring a water supply
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
study in accordance with local
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
regulations so it's allowing local
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
regulations to consider Water Resources
 
01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
um as they're going through a pro
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
project approval process so I I think we
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
need to give our our planning boards and
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
our municipalities the um Power that
 
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
this bill provides them in looking at
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
Water Resources and how they may be
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
impacted with new subdivisions that
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't fall within the um large
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawals or other um
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
projects that would be under New
 
01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees and and I do want to
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
remind the committee too that the New
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association which
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
studies a lot of bills in depth did
 
01:06:58.349 --> 01:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
support this bill so I'm I'm going to
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
vote against the itl so that a to pass
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to speak
 
01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.630 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to speak

01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
Vale um the motion on the floor is
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
interm study point of clarification yes
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
okay so um all right I just want to Echo
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
what uh representative rung said we
 
01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
looked at this bill last year there were
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of concerns that were brought
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
forward and this has returned with those
 
01:07:26.039 --> 01:07:27.309 align:start position:0%
forward and this has returned with those
um

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
concerns excuse me last yes last year um
 
01:07:33.309 --> 01:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
those concerns have been addressed as
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
far as what I can see um and so I just
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
really think enabling and not mandating
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
really comes forward for me with local
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
control and that we do want to enable
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
Town governments to have the ability to
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
oversee what's going on in their own
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair I'm sure I'm
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
going to take a lot of flak for this but
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna support your uh this notion of
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
interim study um I I think that the
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor did do a lot of work I think
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
that there is a real problem um the
 
01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:15.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor talked about this um Coming
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
forth in their planning board you know
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
in their local planning board multiple
 
01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
times um the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
Association also supports
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
um there was this was previously studied
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
by um a subcommittee and um but that was
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
actually in 2010 and that's the reason
 
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
why I think it's reasonable to to
 
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
evaluate it again make sure that um
 
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.749 align:start position:0%
evaluate it again make sure that um
something

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
as potentially significant as um as you
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
know requiring a a hydrological survey
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
um and the impacts of that really gets
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
considered from all perspectives so
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
sorry to all the people that are gonna
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh throw Flack at me but I'm going to
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
study is there anyone else who wishes to

yours thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to speak today
 
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
1494 relative to ohvs um so to update
 
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
some of our newest members uh in 2022
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
this committee uh voted to create a uh
 
01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
hb11 188 study committee on ohvs in New
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so this bill is uh born out of
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
some of the discussions that we've heard
 
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
in that uh committee the chairman and
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
myself are two members who serve on that
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
committee um the the I'm going to skip
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
there's five sections it's they're um
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
all related to hrvs but I'm going to
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
skip section one um right now and and
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
come back to that later so that study
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
commission was meant to be a place that
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
all discussions about ohvs could be had
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
um the numerous you know uh Rising
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
issues or concerns could be brought um
 
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:43.639 align:start position:0%
so we hear from a vast array of people
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
on the subject with a lot of different
 
01:22:45.679 --> 01:22:46.510 align:start position:0%
on the subject with a lot of different
um

01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.030 align:start position:0%
um
motivations

01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
motivations
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
um so section two of the bill that was
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to start by saying that
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh there I will be bringing forward an
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill before we exec uh
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
execute um so I'll talk on touch on some
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
of those amendments that I've already
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
discussed with members who are going to
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
testify after me um but and and I'll
 
01:23:09.629 --> 01:23:09.639 align:start position:0%
start by saying that section two is
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
going to be removed that was brought to
 
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
me by a local uh golf club um who
 
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
believed that the prohibition was in
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
state law and it turns out it's a
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
federal restriction um so we're just
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and remove that uh
 
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
from the bill um section three uh it
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
takes language that already exists in
 
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 26182 in relation to other
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
agricultural vehicles um and then it
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
just extends that to utility vehicles um
 
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
many of you have probably seen stories
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
involving accidents with ohvs in the
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
southern half of the state where on the
 
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
road use of ohvs is less common a number
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
of these accident accidents involved uh
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
inappropriate use of special
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
registration plates uh there was a a
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
tragic one in Auburn in 2021 that
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
claimed the life of a mother and son
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
these special registrations exist to
 
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
help ease the regulatory burden on farms
 
01:24:02.669 --> 01:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
and other small businesses it is vital
 
01:24:05.229 --> 01:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
that we protect them um there's a myth
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
at at the same time there's a myth going
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
around that by simply registering a UTV
 
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
through a business you can drive it
 
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
anywhere um the commission has heard
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
that one contributing factor is the
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
inconsistent requirements between local
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
Town clerks um some will will ask for
 
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
more um evidence when when for creating
 
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
one of these registrations others will
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
not um and so it leads to this well I
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
just had mine registered in this town
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
and it was no problem they just checked
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
it off in other towns they people who
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
should deserve the license plate have to
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
jump through a couple Hoops um so this
 
01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
is just taking language that's that's
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
already applied for other agricultural
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
license plates and then extends it to
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
the UTV license plate and it's meant to
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
help um shift the onus to the operator
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
to the person who is applying for the
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
permit to make sure they understand what
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're applying for and what the
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
license plate is meant to be be used
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
for and by doing this we can help um
 
01:25:05.629 --> 01:25:05.639 align:start position:0%
protect that a industrial license plate
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
that is used by SM bus small businesses
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
and Farmers around our state um we can
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
help make sure that that is available to
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
them in the
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
future so section four of the bill um
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
this is a small fix to make sure that
 
01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
funds are going to the appropriate place
 
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
so this deals with the ohrv event permit
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's issued by fishing game as anyone
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
on the ohrv commission would agree
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of confusion between this
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
fishing game permit and the special use
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
permit that's issued by dncr for events
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
on state lands so this is the fishing
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
game event permit and they are monitored
 
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
exclusively by fish and game with the
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
help of local law enforcement So
 
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
currently $15 of the $50 permit fee is
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
transmitted to dncr $7.50 goes to
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
Administration and $7.50 goes into the
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
grant and aid fund um and we're only
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
talking about a couple thousand each
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
year that gets transferred and we're
 
01:25:58.830 --> 01:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
likely spending more splitting it up
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
into those funds than we are sending it
 
01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
to the grant and aid fund uh so for
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
comparison the grant and aid fund budget
 
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh last year was $4 to5 million so we're
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
talking about 05% of those funds and
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
they probably could be better used by
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
fishing game to oversee the permits that
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
issuing um this uh there's a correction
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
that will be issued in amendment to make
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
sure that this is apply to both
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles and ohvs this was meant to
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
be a b dealt with ohvs somehow it only
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
made it into the snowmobile portion of
 
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
the law so RSA 2155a applies to ohvs and
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 215 C applies to snow wheels so the
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
both um so section five of this bill um
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
is related to Grant aid funds and the
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
uses of them so one thing that I've
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
heard in the North Country um that's
 
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
been brought up to me by multiple people
 
01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
is that the cost involved with
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
engineering larger projects can be
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
burdensome for
 
01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
clubs uh so if a club is applying for
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
funds to let's say create a bridge um
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know they have to put up 50% of the
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
funds for that for that bridge they in
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
these larger project the things that
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
require more upfront costs they're
 
01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for those entire upfront
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
costs because the department funds can
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
only be used in the 6 months after
 
01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
they're issued so you know for something
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
like a bridge you could be spending
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
$50,000 on the bridge materials for the
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
club could be spending that getting
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
50,000 from um from the grant n program
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
but then they would have to put up you
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
know 35 $40,000 ahead of time for for a
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
larger project to make sure it's
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
engineered before they bring that
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
project to uh apply for the funds um so
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
the intent of that that was to ease that
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
burden on the clubs for these larger
 
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
projects um I think in light of you know
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
the in light of the the damage that
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
happened in December and the more we're
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
learning about the damage that's
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
happened in uh over over last summer the
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
I think it's I I I think I agree with
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
the people who are going to speak after
 
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
me that we should just hold off on
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
making that change but I think it's
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
something that should be discussed um
 
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments that going to be
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
made uh is going to be that these funds
 
01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
have to be spent within six months from
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
the that sixth month requirement is
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
currently establishing rules not not
 
01:28:33.629 --> 01:28:33.639 align:start position:0%
statute so I think it's completely
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate for if the legislature were
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
to allow them to be used for the funds
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
or direct dncr to allow them to be used
 
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
for these funds that they could be there
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
could be other rules created to make
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
sure that those engineering projects
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
aren't taking up all of the money for
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
for the projects that are shovel ready
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
um so that brings me to section one um
 
01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
so section one is an attempt to get more
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
Buy in to the ohrv um program in our
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
state so U many of you and many people I
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
think in the southern part of the state
 
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
might think of Berlin as like we all
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
love ohvs and ohvs are the best thing
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
ever and we're going to keep supporting
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
them forever um I think you know living
 
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
in the community there is a um still a
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
very vocal group who think that ohvs
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
will go away and I think that that is
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
not a realistic belief I think that you
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
know we you know um that ohvs just like
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles are a um going to be a
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
fixture of New Hampshire for a long time
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
to come and I want them to be um so when
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
I hear those people and I do hear from
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
them uh enough um I I'm trying to think
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
of ways that we can make it so that they
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
can feel that they have some more
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
control over over the ohvs in our
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
state the the intent of this is to
 
01:30:05.109 --> 01:30:05.119 align:start position:0%
expand the definition of an ohrv club uh
 
01:30:07.629 --> 01:30:07.639 align:start position:0%
so it it eliminates the thing that says
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
that they have to be ohrv users and it
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
says I have to have a focus on ohrv so
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
that I just want to it does say it has
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
to have a focus on ohvs and maybe that
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
language could say it has to have the
 
01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
primary focus bvs but I think that
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to to allow those
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
who see harm or feel harm uh with
 
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
ohrv to be able to deal with those
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
issues with the same state support that
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
we give to OHV users in the state um the
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
the by changing that definition we are
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
still requiring them to go through the
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
same application process so they would
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
still still have to show that they are
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
going to benefit the trail system in the
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
same way that these other projects are
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
going to benefit the trail system but
 
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
maybe there could be a state
 
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
organization who is you know listening
 
01:31:07.109 --> 01:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
to those who feel the most affected by
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
ohvs and then addressing their concerns
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
I think that state our state departments
 
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
do an excellent job of of listening for
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
those type of complaints and responding
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
to them but they're not always equipped
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
to deal with them completely
 
01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
um under current rules for the grant aid
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
program uh clubs are not the only ones
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
who can apply for funds uh towns um can
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
also apply for those funds currently but
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
yet no towns are applying for those
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
funds and I think that that shows that
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
there is a you know there are other
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
public you know it concerns that the
 
01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
local municipality isn't equipped to
 
01:31:50.189 --> 01:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
deal with or feels that they would
 
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
be harming their their other interests
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
by applying for those funds for certain
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
uses so I think that you know this is in
 
01:32:03.109 --> 01:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
light of the damage in the Grant and a
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
funding that we're going to need over
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
the next year I I I also intend to
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
withdraw this part of the um bill um but
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
I did want to have that discussion I do
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
think that there is that there is more
 
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
that we can do as a state to address
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
some of those those concerns and maybe
 
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
make people feel like there's a bit
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
more that the state because the state
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
currently offers funding to ohvs to
 
01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:33.400 align:start position:0%
incentivize them so you know if we can
 
01:32:36.669 --> 01:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
have some way for the state to also give
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
those an opport give those who you know
 
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
who are traditionally opposed to ohrv
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
use an opportunity to use those funds
 
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
constructively towards the benefit of
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
ohrv use in our state I think it will
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
help the longevity of the program and
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
maybe lower some of the tensions that
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
we're uh that we feel uh in these
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
communities where Ohr use is more uh
 
01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.070 align:start position:0%
communities where Ohr use is more uh
common

01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
common
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
um thank
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
you any questions by members of the
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative run thank you
 
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm a little
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
confused um when you me we're talking
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
about expanding the definition of ohrv
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
Club so that organizations that weren't
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
traditional like they don't
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
traditionally support ohrv use because
 
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
they have a focus on the use and so that
 
01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
they could then get funds to improve
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
ohrv use I'm I'm kind of confused
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
because if there's a group that doesn't
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
support OVR ohrv use but they'd be
 
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
getting funds to improve the use of Ohr
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
if you could just kind of explain that
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
and then was that also a section you
 
01:34:01.629 --> 01:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
said will come out an
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you yeah yes thank you
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
so sections one two and five I plan to
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
withdraw an amendment um so the yes the
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
the what I think we're going to hear is
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
that this will open up the program to
 
01:34:21.109 --> 01:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
hundreds of other organizations to apply
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
for the f
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think I I Envision a existing
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
organization that could could use these
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
funds but for example when you open up a
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
trail on your property oh for example
 
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
let's just look at there is a currently
 
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
a connector Trail
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
between uh between north umberland and
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
colbrook and that trail is currently
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
closed to ohrv use due to landowner com
 
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
problems with the ohrv club who
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
represents that that trail so the the
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
landowner feels that the club is
 
01:35:03.149 --> 01:35:03.159 align:start position:0%
not um addressing his concerns and I
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
know that um dncr has stepped in and
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
talked with this landowner before um but
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
that trail does remain
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
closed the I think that there could be a
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
third party group who could you know
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
address those concerns directly who
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
could you know listen to the land owner
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know he says that there's trash
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
problems on the property he says that
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
there's other concerns and specifically
 
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
address his concerns in a way that you
 
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
know a state organization may not be
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
equipped to do so um and and maybe you
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
know by you know addressing his concerns
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
directly um that we can continue that
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
trail connector being open so instead of
 
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
having to spend funds to build a new
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
trail that goes around his property we
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
can directly address his concerns and
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
get that property open um I think that
 
01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of times where a trail is
 
01:35:58.830 --> 01:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
on a private land owner's property on
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
the edge of a property and his abutters
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
have complaints about the use and they
 
01:36:04.750 --> 01:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
have no control they feel they have no
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
control and oftentimes they don't have
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
any control over the use of on because
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
it's on another person's private
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
property so an organization that could
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
address those Butters
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
concerns could would benefit the clubs
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
the Trail's use because it's going to
 
01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
keep it from being ch on other fronts um
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
and it's D dealing with them directly
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
and and quickly in a lot of
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
cases that example really helped explain
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
it thank you so much any other questions
 
01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.950 align:start position:0%
it thank you so much any other questions
representative

01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
Bale yes um thank you uh for taking my
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
question and thank you Mr chair you
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
referred to the damage of last summer um
 
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
do you want to say more about what
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
happened last
 
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:53.149 align:start position:0%
happened last
summer

01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so the the wash outs that we had
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide you know we've talked about
 
01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
the I'm sure you've seen you know the
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
the uh money that had to go into the
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
highway budget all those highways you
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
know there's ohrv trails in all those
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
communities as well so many of them
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
exist along waterways and um other
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
corridors and they don't have the as
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
much uh existing you know Culvert
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and all those other
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
things so we're talking wash outs and
 
01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
other issues there's currently Senate
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 397 that's working its way through
 
01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate that's looking to add about
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
$2 million to the grant Aid budget um so
 
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
in light of those I don't think that
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
either of these um programs especially
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
because they don't take take effect
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
until next year would have a major
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
impact on the grant aid program but I
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
just don't I don't think there's any
 
01:37:44.669 --> 01:37:44.679 align:start position:0%
reason to touch it this year I think
 
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
that we can we can deal with that in a
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
future um
 
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
session any other other questions by
 
01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:53.910 align:start position:0%
session any other other questions by
representative

01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly for taking my
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
question this is there's a lot of pieces
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
to this bill I I have multiple questions
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
but I will just ask the one
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
initially um your section three you said
 
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
you know is the intent is to make sure
 
01:38:12.589 --> 01:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
that people aren't I think you said
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
aren't misregistered their utility
 
01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles but it seems to me the the
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
portion of Statute that you are updating
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
actually has a separate Roman 4 for
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
motorcycles trail bikes and agricultural
 
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles that meet ohrv and so I'm
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
wondering why you modified Roman 1
 
01:38:36.109 --> 01:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
instead of Roman 4 where Roman 1 might
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
be like tractors and and have broader
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
implication broader impact than just
 
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
you let me see if I can pull up 259
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
quickly and look at at it my so as I was
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
taking so I took the language from 2598
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
82 it's it's
 
01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
26141 okay so so the 26182 or uh the the
 
01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
was where I just took the language from
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
I had asked OS to just insert that into
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay the the under ohvs as well so it it
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
for well follow up thank you Mr chair
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank thank you again representative
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
Kelly um also um you know I I think I
 
01:39:33.149 --> 01:39:33.159 align:start position:0%
got your gist of section four which is
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying hey that we're
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're chopping up this the fees that are
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
paid into little tiny pieces and fishing
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
game really needs the fees but I wonder
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
like it seems that some of the some of
 
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
the fees where this is going today are
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
to um Grant and kind funding for trail
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance um other Trail maintenance
 
01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
and uh land purchases and easements and
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
will those you know are those will those
 
01:40:01.709 --> 01:40:01.719 align:start position:0%
suffer will will um public lands will be
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
not able to sort of obtain the easements
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
that they need to make ohvs you know um
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
to expand ohrv use if if those funding
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
if that funding is
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
cut so the majority of funding is comes
 
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
from registrations so we're talking
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
about maybe
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
05% of funds
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
very very very small percent and the
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
fishing game could definitely use that
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
that fund those funds to to better
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
monitor to continue to monitor all the
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
permits that they um are they issue
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
program anyone else have a question
 
01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.750 align:start position:0%
program anyone else have a question
representative

01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
lonte yes I was just trying to
 
01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
understand the the section of um the
 
01:40:51.149 --> 01:40:51.159 align:start position:0%
funds and how the fees and how these
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
were distributed I mean I think it seems
 
01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
a little vague to just say there will
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
either go um to dncr or fishing
 
01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.709 align:start position:0%
either go um to dncr or fishing
game

01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
um are there and then but then you've
 
01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:10.679 align:start position:0%
added the and um under rule
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
making um that you might impose
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
administrative fines and is that u a
 
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
potential source of funding could one go
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
to one and one to the other
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
I just think it was a little confusing
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
just by adding the or in
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
there yeah I'm a bit confused about
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
where that administrative findes section
 
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
came from uh my request to OS was to
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
Simply remove the section that says 750
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
shall go to and 750 shall go to and is
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
simply appropriate all to fishing game
 
01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
um so that Miss must be in related to
 
01:41:47.709 --> 01:41:47.719 align:start position:0%
you know some other um actually that's
 
01:41:49.709 --> 01:41:49.719 align:start position:0%
in section five so that's that's
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
probably where that they came and again
 
01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:53.719 align:start position:0%
I don't know why that appeared in there
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
because section five is was meant to
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
just add that stipulation to the Grand a
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
program Grant AG is currently only in
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
rules uh the rules or the the what it
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
can be applied to is only in rules so uh
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
it could be that they needed to add that
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
language to to make it so they could add
 
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't answer your question
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
or does
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh maybe if
 
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
you you'll fix it you'll find the
 
01:42:28.149 --> 01:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
reasons and fix that section five will
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
be completely removed so that part about
 
01:42:33.629 --> 01:42:33.639 align:start position:0%
that will be removed and um I think that
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh both fishing game and dncr are
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
testifying you can ask them how what
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
percentage of funds are coming that way
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
the majority of funds four to5 million
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
are coming from other
 
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
sources any other questions by members
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
of the committee seeing none thank you
 
01:42:51.599 --> 01:42:53.790 align:start position:0%
of the committee seeing none thank you
very

01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:42:58.030 --> 01:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
much chair recognizes Captain Mike Ean
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.510 --> 01:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
game good morning my name is Captain
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
Mike Leeman the hampsh fishing game
 
01:43:12.189 --> 01:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
department I am the ohrv uh enforcement
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
safety and um training coordinator um
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
it's I want to thank representative
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
Kelly for bringing this bill uh it does
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot of well-intentioned things
 
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
from uh the 1188 commission um as far is
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh what I'm going to speak to today is
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
is really just number two and then uh
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
the section uh which was uh the event
 
01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.430 align:start position:0%
the section uh which was uh the event
permits

01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
permits
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
which find it
 
01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
here so to the uh to start off uh this
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
went in front of uh Fishing Game
 
01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
Commission and they were opposed uh to
 
01:43:56.189 --> 01:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
um to the bill um for multitude of
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
reasons um one of which uh to speak to
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
number two which would be changing the
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh ATV um which um would add the uh age
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
of 14 and operating uh for a golf cart
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
and a golf facility um at this point
 
01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
this only speaks to ATVs which um within
 
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
ohrv ATVs are more of your four-wheel
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
Ride On Top motorcycle style um
 
01:44:24.589 --> 01:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
machine whereas a golf cart would not be
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
an ohrv it's not considered an ohrv um
 
01:44:30.189 --> 01:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
so this really uh would not uh sit
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
within that um and we wouldn't want any
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
confusion between a UTV which is more of
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
your dune buggy uh with steering wheel
 
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
which would be more of the look more
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
like a golf cart and get that confused
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
with the two um and there is no age
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
limit within those um from our
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
impression uh this is more of an issue
 
01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
with the golf club and not an ohrv issue
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
so that was really why we were opposed
 
01:44:59.550 --> 01:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
to that section as far as event permits
 
01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
um we have no issue with the changes um
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
within uh
 
01:45:07.709 --> 01:45:07.719 align:start position:0%
215c um but it only speaks to 215c which
 
01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
is snowmobiles um there is another
 
01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
section within 215 a30 which speaks to
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
events um within o the ohb statute so um
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
that would have to be added um the
 
01:45:24.189 --> 01:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
reason in uh behind the changes to uh
 
01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
215c uh for the event permits um was and
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
and really speaking to the changes in
 
01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of the um fee for the
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
permit uh really what that comes from is
 
01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
um and the reasoning behind it is that
 
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
the addition to this would be that we
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
would keep a public calendar um which we
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
certainly can do through our public
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
affairs and um in the review of of uh
 
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
all those event permits
 
01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
um but really um the event permits the
 
01:45:57.790 --> 01:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
majority of them do not occur on Trails
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
some do uh this event permit only speaks
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
to unregistered snow machines or o hrvs
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh for which uh the fishing game
 
01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
department would would enforce um so
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
really for the $50 with the only $750
 
01:46:18.589 --> 01:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
cents coming to fishing game uh we would
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh we would be doing the the work and
 
01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
enforcing it so we would process the the
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
permit um notify make sure that
 
01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
everything is legitimate on that permit
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
there is we have had circumstances where
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
people enter things and say yes I spoke
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
to the town and the police department
 
01:46:36.589 --> 01:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
and none of that is true so we have to
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
verify all of that we have to notify the
 
01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:41.560 align:start position:0%
officers supervisors for that area so it
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
takes us time um there's a lot of leg
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
work there and then if there is a
 
01:46:46.669 --> 01:46:46.679 align:start position:0%
problem within the event permit we have
 
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
to send an officer to basically enforce
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
that portion of our loss so um we feel
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
that the $50 and and that there is not a
 
01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
desire to increase that fee um from $50
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh so that there can be a breakup of
 
01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
distribution and where there isn't a
 
01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
whole the majority of these permits
 
01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
aren't occurring on trails that the the
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
bulk of the work is being done by
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
fishing game and that's why that change
 
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
would the $50 would come to fishing game
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
and not have a breakup and Grant need
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
and um that would not take away from
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
what comes out of
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
registrations um for the grant n program
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
so and I won't speak to the grant n
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
program or any other section because I
 
01:47:30.669 --> 01:47:30.679 align:start position:0%
think there are others from other
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
agencies that are more qualified to that
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
so um that's really the sections that I
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
want to speak on
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay any questions
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
Captain representative har
 
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
representative Derby thank you Mr chair
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question just
 
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
very briefly you said that it only
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
covered 215c because uh and that's
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles what was the other chapter
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
what was the other section you mentioned
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
so the other section that would affect
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none very much thank
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau good morning uh my name is Craig
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
rany I'm the chief of the Bureau of
 
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
trails at the Department of Natural and
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
cultural resources and I just handed out
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
some written testimony regarding the
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
bill um we're not taking a position on
 
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
it we just wanted to share a few
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
concerns with it and some of the
 
01:48:49.390 --> 01:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
language um as representative Kelly had
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
um so the redefining the term ohrv Club
 
01:48:58.750 --> 01:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
um to remove that the requirement of the
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
club being a group of ohrv users to the
 
01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
club um only having a focus on ohrv use
 
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
um you know the O ohrv users help fund
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
the grant and aid program as you heard
 
01:49:12.189 --> 01:49:12.199 align:start position:0%
through the ohrv registrations so
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
therefore the definition of ohrv Club
 
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
should continue to be members who are
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
actual ohrv you know users as this model
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
has worked well New Hampshire for over
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
50 years um you know as representative
 
01:49:26.189 --> 01:49:26.199 align:start position:0%
Kelly mentioned the the the commission
 
01:49:28.109 --> 01:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
the fiveyear study committee to study
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
ohrv use in New Hampshire you know we've
 
01:49:33.149 --> 01:49:33.159 align:start position:0%
been meeting since 2022 it's an active
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
group um you know it's a full fiveyear
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
study and and we would recommend you
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
know allowing that study committee to
 
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
continue its research on some of these
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
issues and make their recommendations as
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
a full committee prior to making any
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
statutory changes on
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
that um but but as representative Kelly
 
01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
said that's section one of the proposed
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
language he is withdrawing so that uh
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
may not be a concern any longer um the
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
other section um in section five that we
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
were concerned about is the distribution
 
01:50:06.990 --> 01:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
of grant and aid reimbursements for up
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
to 50% engineering costs as
 
01:50:11.709 --> 01:50:11.719 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly mentioned uh most
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
Trail related G projects that we fund
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
they don't require engineering study uh
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
most of their projects are considered di
 
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
Minimus or maintenance projects um for
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
just ongoing maintenance and
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
improvements um and again even most of
 
01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
the projects qualify for simple Trail
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
notification through de which is a
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
really simple permit process there's no
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
engineering involved with that uh so
 
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
again it's very rare that we have
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
engineering cost involved with Trail
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance projects and the you know
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
the 100 snowmobile clubs and the 25 ATV
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
clubs in the state that that help with
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
Trail maintenance again the majority of
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
it is just Trail ongoing Trail
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
maintenance for snowm bills it's winter
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
grooming as well that the grant aid
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
helps to reimburse but it's it's a
 
01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
regular maintenance um program um so the
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
the concern about putting money into
 
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
engineering um firms and groups to to
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
study or engineer on different projects
 
01:51:07.629 --> 01:51:07.639 align:start position:0%
I don't see it as um something that
 
01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
occurs that often in the program U but
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
the concern could be that if monies were
 
01:51:14.189 --> 01:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
redirected to engineering firms or
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
Consultants um that less of the
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance regular ongoing maintenance
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
of the trail system would would take hit
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
from those monies not being put into
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
direct maintenance and it could affect
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
Public Safety of Trail
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
users um but again that section 52 I
 
01:51:31.229 --> 01:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
think representative Kelly mentioned um
 
01:51:33.069 --> 01:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
withdrawing that uh section with
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
engineering so again the testimoni
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
really was based on those two sections
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
as the main concern um but I hopefully
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
the committee will continue to meet uh
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
chairman is on that as well and and
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
we'll uh come up with more suggestions
 
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
in the future as we conclude that again
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
another uh three plus years of of
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
meetings to talk about it I think our
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
next meeting is coming up in March so um
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
much Richard
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:25.390 align:start position:0%
 
Association

01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Rulo and members
 
01:52:28.589 --> 01:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Rich Parsons
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
I work at ryp grite strategies here in
 
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:33.560 align:start position:0%
conquer and um I'm here today on behalf
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire off highway vehicle
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
association uh we were opposed to the
 
01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:39.719 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced uh we had some
 
01:52:41.069 --> 01:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
productive conversations with
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly and we understand
 
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
um he's going to be removing section one
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
and two and five and I think with that
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
we're fairly neutral on the other
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
section changes I'll just say in terms
 
01:52:55.709 --> 01:52:55.719 align:start position:0%
of you know the sworn Avid David piece
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
to get back to your question earlier we
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
have that language already in statute
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
for special commercial plates which have
 
01:53:05.790 --> 01:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to um access the main roads
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
for special purposes and the Agriculture
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
and Industrial plates have the ability
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
depending on which use it is to go up to
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
10 Mi you know between the farmland and
 
01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
2 miles I think if it's an industrial
 
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
complex land
 
01:53:22.270 --> 01:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
and putting that in there will will
 
01:53:24.910 --> 01:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that you know when a town clerk
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
gets a request for one of them they have
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
to sign that they understand they can't
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
use it to go to Dunkin Donuts they can't
 
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
use it to go grocery shopping that it
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
has to be for the uh Agriculture and
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
Industrial use there's enforcement of
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
this section is all over the place um
 
01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
you know some clerks don't give almost
 
01:53:46.589 --> 01:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
any of these um kind of plates out and
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
some just give it to anyone it doesn't
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
really matter the vehicle so um we
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
definitely do not have a a problem with
 
01:53:55.149 --> 01:53:55.159 align:start position:0%
including that in in the Agriculture and
 
01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
Industrial section and we think it's in
 
01:54:00.189 --> 01:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
the the proper section there um in terms
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
of the event permits piece we also um I
 
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
think agree that you know it's currently
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the snowmobile section and if this is
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
geared at ohvs it should be in ohrv
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
section as well or um and if the
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
snowmobilers are um okay with it in
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
their section but I think they'll speak
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
to that a little later
 
01:54:24.669 --> 01:54:24.679 align:start position:0%
um I think in the event permits um the
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
1188 study commission which thank you to
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly and representative
 
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
Rula for being a part of and the late um
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
Suzanne Smith for forming the committee
 
01:54:35.870 --> 01:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
I think you know it's very important
 
01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
that it's a five-year Commission because
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of these issues are very complex
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
and take a lot of time I mean the event
 
01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
permits we've created diagrams to try
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
and uh differentiate all the different
 
01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:51.719 align:start position:0%
um event permits there are between dncr
 
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know do Crossing permits um fishing
 
01:54:57.870 --> 01:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
games so while this I think uh moves the
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
money with fishing game and and creates
 
01:55:01.629 --> 01:55:01.639 align:start position:0%
some improvement we hope that this
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
commission continues to work on the
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
event permit section because we do think
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
that there is some additional Clarity
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
and you know a more comprehensive um
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
look at them in general that needs to
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
continue to be done um I will um just
 
01:55:19.149 --> 01:55:19.159 align:start position:0%
going back to what representative Kelly
 
01:55:21.069 --> 01:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
said in terms of um working with land
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
owners and and while there are some
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
issues with land owners I think our
 
01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
clubs work very closely with land owners
 
01:55:30.589 --> 01:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
and municipalities um to make sure that
 
01:55:33.229 --> 01:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
everyone is happy I mean 80% or so of
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
our trail system relies on private land
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
owners we have some clubs that to get
 
01:55:40.709 --> 01:55:40.719 align:start position:0%
approval for projects they need over 170
 
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
signatures of land owners to be able to
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
get permission to to do some of this
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
stuff so I think we work very well with
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
many um land owners to the state there
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
are obviously situations where we don't
 
01:55:53.709 --> 01:55:53.719 align:start position:0%
um and we are concerned about opening
 
01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
the definition of OHV clubs um from this
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated money for um from ohrv
 
01:56:03.629 --> 01:56:03.639 align:start position:0%
registrations for ohrv Riders and users
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
to to help with that if if a group that
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
maybe isn't getting along with the
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
landowner like the example given if a
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
third party group all of a c sudden
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
exists and there's almost like a
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
duplicative efforts trying to be done
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
maybe to to fix one certain trail system
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
and who does dncr work with who does the
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
town work with um I know it was
 
01:56:25.229 --> 01:56:25.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned that municipalities don't
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily apply for G funds but in
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
many cases they are very closely um
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
partnered with clubs you know sometimes
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
they identify issues for clubs that they
 
01:56:39.629 --> 01:56:39.639 align:start position:0%
want fixed or they hear from land owners
 
01:56:40.750 --> 01:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
that they want addressed and so the
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
clubs are the ones that take it on and
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
fix it as as you know class six roads
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
Town cannot maintain class six roads so
 
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of um circumstances it would you
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
know the clubs are the ones that apply
 
01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that can
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
provide the matching funds because the
 
01:56:58.109 --> 01:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
municipality cannot be the one to do it
 
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
on those roads um so I I I guess while
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities maybe have not been
 
01:57:06.350 --> 01:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
applying much for Gia they are closely
 
01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
um working with folks so all that to say
 
01:57:13.149 --> 01:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
you know section one and section five
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
looking to change the Gia funds we
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate um the sponsor's willingness
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
to um continue to work on that at the
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
study commission level and I think have
 
01:57:23.709 --> 01:57:23.719 align:start position:0%
these conversations which I think are
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
important conversations to continue to
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
have and also that uh the recognition
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
that all the storm damage that was
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
caused last year caused millions of
 
01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
dollars in damage to the trail system
 
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
between the July storm alone which you
 
01:57:39.390 --> 01:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
know there's a bill in trying to get $2
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
million that's in Senate Finance um a
 
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
million of which would just be for State
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
Trails um itself and damage that
 
01:57:48.669 --> 01:57:48.679 align:start position:0%
occurred and that's just the July storm
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
that doesn't include the December storm
 
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
so Gia funds are really going to be
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
utilized these next couple of years to
 
01:57:58.109 --> 01:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
to Really it usually is to maintain
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
these Trails but I think it's a lot of
 
01:58:01.069 --> 01:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
it's going to unfortunately have to be
 
01:58:03.629 --> 01:58:03.639 align:start position:0%
used to to help repair and fix them so
 
01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
we appreciate his willingness to hold
 
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
off on that and continue those
 
01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
discussions um and with that I think
 
01:58:12.030 --> 01:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take any questions any
 
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.149 --> 01:58:19.159 align:start position:0%

01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:22.239 align:start position:0%

01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman renzou and members
 
01:58:55.870 --> 01:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
of the House committee my name is Brian
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
L and I serve as the vice president of
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Snowmobile Association
 
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
I do have a a brief prepared statement
 
01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
here to share with you on behalf of the
 
01:59:05.550 --> 01:59:05.560 align:start position:0%
association uh regarding the language
 
01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
for House Bill
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
1494 uh the association isn't in
 
01:59:12.189 --> 01:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
opposition to the language change simply
 
01:59:13.709 --> 01:59:13.719 align:start position:0%
because grant and aid was specifically
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
designed to help and support clubs with
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
Trail grooming and maintenance costs the
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
grant nid program is funded by
 
01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:21.589 align:start position:0%
grant nid program is funded by
snowmobile

01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
snowmobile
 
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
andv registrations and you can imagine
 
01:59:25.629 --> 01:59:25.639 align:start position:0%
those registrations are down
 
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
significantly with non-conducive with
 
01:59:29.069 --> 01:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
winter weather
 
01:59:31.109 --> 01:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
conditions uh I'm not sure if any of you
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
have been on the receiving end of an
 
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
engineering bill before but I can assure
 
01:59:35.709 --> 01:59:35.719 align:start position:0%
you if you have how expensive they can
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
be and quickly spiral out of spiral out
 
01:59:40.350 --> 01:59:40.360 align:start position:0%
of control the grant nade system simply
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
can't afford to pay any portion of any
 
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
engineering bills it just wasn't
 
01:59:46.189 --> 01:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
designed to do so at this
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
point further if this change were to
 
01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
take place
 
01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
it could be misinterpreted as a deao
 
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
prerequisite for building recreational
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
buges Bridges culverts and Etc on our
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
trails and could completely drain the
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
Gia Fund in the future until Gia becomes
 
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
substantially more robust these types of
 
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
additional draws cannot be implemented
 
02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:07.830 align:start position:0%
additional draws cannot be implemented
without

02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
consequence um I believe the
 
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
representative is going to withdraw this
 
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
section five so this is at this point
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
most likely a moot point but I just
 
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to state that on behalf of the
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
association to the committee uh thank
 
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
you for your time and with that I'd be
 
02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you may
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
have any any questions by members of the
 
02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
02:00:31.069 --> 02:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr lb
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
for coming to our committee today good
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
to see you good to see you um question
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
for you so if one two and five are
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
out does the association still object to
 
02:00:44.189 --> 02:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
then parts of section four if I
 
02:00:46.030 --> 02:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly the the fee
 
02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
distribution and whatnot so I believe
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
the association positions on the balance
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill would be like
 
02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
neutral so I don't think we're we're
 
02:00:56.109 --> 02:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
we're not concerned with that further
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
question for a
 
02:01:03.069 --> 02:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
followup so so section four
 
02:01:06.069 --> 02:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
then if if it's if section four stays in
 
02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
you're you're fine with
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
the the uh the division between 215c and
 
02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
2155a snowmobiles and
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:24.589 --> 02:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
is that it
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
thanks is there anyone else from the
 
02:01:33.390 --> 02:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much I think I
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
had all the pink
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
cards there anybody else who is looking
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
to speak if
 
02:01:43.149 --> 02:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
not I will close the hearing thank you
 
02:01:43.159 --> 02:01:45.310 align:start position:0%
not I will close the hearing thank you
very

02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
much and we're back at
 
02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:59.950 align:start position:0%
much and we're back at
one

02:01:59.950 --> 02:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
he's on the committee with you you
 
02:02:03.870 --> 02:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
haven't finished he's coming in with
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
this knock three
 
02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
sections yeah I would talk to him
 
02:02:11.229 --> 02:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
because it's like he's going against his
 
02:02:11.239 --> 02:02:12.870 align:start position:0%
because it's like he's going against his
own

02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
commission representative Kelly can I
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
speak with you for a few
 
02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:39.830 align:start position:0%
speak with you for a few
minutes

02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
fire burning well I got a million two
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
deal going and then they changed the
 
02:02:47.149 --> 02:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
deal at the last minute so they're
 
02:02:50.109 --> 02:02:50.119 align:start position:0%
they're all waiting for me to call
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.880 --> 02:49:13.710 align:start position:0%
 
way

02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:13.720 --> 03:03:44.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:03:44.110 --> 03:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:46.030 --> 03:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record my
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
name is Erica Leon I represent the town
 
03:03:50.190 --> 03:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
of dairy and I'm here to introduce my
 
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill House Bill 153 relative to the
 
03:03:55.790 --> 03:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
definition of wetlands I live on sheno
 
03:03:58.790 --> 03:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
road um potent potentially better known
 
03:04:02.309 --> 03:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
as the end of the new exit 4A um there's
 
03:04:04.070 --> 03:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of different work that's going on
 
03:04:06.269 --> 03:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
and driving home I found it really
 
03:04:08.190 --> 03:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
interesting that there were the little
 
03:04:11.150 --> 03:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
pink flags for Wetlands everywhere on
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
the uphill side of the road just about
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
everybody along the road has small
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
little puddle sized Wetlands designated
 
03:04:20.510 --> 03:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
on their property and that's why I
 
03:04:23.429 --> 03:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
brought this bill to me a wetland is
 
03:04:25.389 --> 03:04:25.399 align:start position:0%
actually a viable ecosystem that
 
03:04:27.389 --> 03:04:27.399 align:start position:0%
actually can support plants and life in
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
more than just a small little area
 
03:04:33.030 --> 03:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's smaller than this table um as I
 
03:04:34.990 --> 03:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
work through this um I do have to admit
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
that I had my attention on some other
 
03:04:38.349 --> 03:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
bills so I probably should have done a
 
03:04:39.750 --> 03:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more homework on this in
 
03:04:41.630 --> 03:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
order to better look into the whole
 
03:04:44.110 --> 03:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
process um but I do believe that it's
 
03:04:45.389 --> 03:04:45.399 align:start position:0%
very important that we are not
 
03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
designating puddles as Wetlands um I did
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
look back on the history of some of my
 
03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
property and there's a very large
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
vibrant ecosystem that was created when
 
03:04:58.510 --> 03:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
chenita Road was put in instead of the
 
03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
old 192 Highway it ended up blocking off
 
03:05:04.190 --> 03:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
the flow and now there's beavers there's
 
03:05:06.670 --> 03:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
birds there's fish living along the edge
 
03:05:09.950 --> 03:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
of my property so by designating that a
 
03:05:11.590 --> 03:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
wetland that's created only by the
 
03:05:14.030 --> 03:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
failure of a state federal orun IAL
 
03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
Public Works project probably would have
 
03:05:18.910 --> 03:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
pointed to that vibrant ecosystem and
 
03:05:21.469 --> 03:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
that wasn't my intention my intention is
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
that if you change the Contours of the
 
03:05:26.070 --> 03:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
road or a culvert underneath the road
 
03:05:28.309 --> 03:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
gets clogged and suddenly you have water
 
03:05:30.510 --> 03:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
backing up that's not really a true
 
03:05:32.269 --> 03:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
viable Wetland and we should be focusing
 
03:05:35.070 --> 03:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
our resources on those good areas um I'm
 
03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
actually on the committee to study um
 
03:05:40.030 --> 03:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered um illnesses
 
03:05:41.750 --> 03:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we were talking about
 
03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and that ALS also seems
 
03:05:45.269 --> 03:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get more information from
 
03:05:46.910 --> 03:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
Dees but it seems that when there's an
 
03:05:48.830 --> 03:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
inappropriate flow of water either too
 
03:05:51.030 --> 03:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
fast or too slow there's more of a
 
03:05:53.469 --> 03:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
chance I'm trying to get uh it seems
 
03:05:54.590 --> 03:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
like there may be more of a chance that
 
03:05:56.349 --> 03:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
you get the cyanobacteria because it's
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
not a healthy flowing situation of the
 
03:06:01.110 --> 03:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
water where it should be traversing it
 
03:06:02.550 --> 03:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
should be filtering as it's going
 
03:06:04.429 --> 03:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
through um as it's going through the
 
03:06:07.429 --> 03:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
natural process of water moving along so
 
03:06:09.229 --> 03:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
I I am concerned that if we end up
 
03:06:11.190 --> 03:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
designating a lot of these puddles as
 
03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
Wetlands we have other problems between
 
03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes um and just just harboring
 
03:06:18.269 --> 03:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
other things that we don't want but I
 
03:06:20.309 --> 03:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
didn't write this correctly um what I
 
03:06:22.429 --> 03:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
would ask you to do would be to interim
 
03:06:23.830 --> 03:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
study this bill because I think that
 
03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
there is a true need to make sure that
 
03:06:28.389 --> 03:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
our exemptions are correct but I didn't
 
03:06:30.190 --> 03:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
do it the right way in this bill so I
 
03:06:31.630 --> 03:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
hope that you could humor me by doing
 
03:06:32.990 --> 03:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
that I'd love to work with you over the
 
03:06:34.830 --> 03:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
summer to figure out how to make sure
 
03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
that we do give the exemptions summer or
 
03:06:39.710 --> 03:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
fall uh but that we do give their
 
03:06:41.950 --> 03:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
correct exemptions to make sure that
 
03:06:44.190 --> 03:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
we're not calling things Wetlands that
 
03:06:46.910 --> 03:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't be um while we can we
 
03:06:48.870 --> 03:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
can focus our resources and not take
 
03:06:51.389 --> 03:06:51.399 align:start position:0%
people's land um and and take the use of
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
their land just because they have a
 
03:06:55.389 --> 03:06:55.399 align:start position:0%
puddle that um has fostered a few seeds
 
03:06:57.309 --> 03:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
and has developed what technically
 
03:06:59.830 --> 03:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
counts as a wetland so with that I'd be
 
03:07:01.630 --> 03:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions any
 
03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
questions members of the committee
 
03:07:03.359 --> 03:07:05.469 align:start position:0%
questions members of the committee
representative

03:07:05.469 --> 03:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:07:08.750 --> 03:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
Bale thank you Mr chair um thank you U
 
03:07:10.510 --> 03:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon for presenting the
 
03:07:13.790 --> 03:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
bill and um for taking my question um
 
03:07:16.030 --> 03:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you live um near exit
 
03:07:19.510 --> 03:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
4A is that i93 um yes so it' be exit 4A
 
03:07:22.030 --> 03:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
off of i93 thank
 
03:07:24.990 --> 03:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
you it's not built yet no the they're so
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
they're still constructing the highway
 
03:07:28.269 --> 03:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
over the freeway but I'm right at the
 
03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
end of the two miles so on Cheno Road
 
03:07:32.229 --> 03:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
they've been flagging all of that in
 
03:07:33.830 --> 03:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
order to do their survey work I think
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:42.309 --> 03:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
now representative run thank you Mr
 
03:07:43.429 --> 03:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you repes representative
 
03:07:47.070 --> 03:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you know I
 
03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
first joined this Committee in 2018 2019
 
03:07:52.870 --> 03:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
and we have we get a lot of wetlands
 
03:07:56.590 --> 03:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
bills and I was and it's the statute's
 
03:07:58.990 --> 03:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive very detailed and I
 
03:08:01.469 --> 03:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
was just wondering um did you meet with
 
03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
people from Dees from the wetlands
 
03:08:05.870 --> 03:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau when you drafted this this bill
 
03:08:07.870 --> 03:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
uh no I didn't unfortunately we had some
 
03:08:09.670 --> 03:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
losses in my family so I wasn't as
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
diligent in preparing this as I
 
03:08:13.670 --> 03:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have been because I'd be
 
03:08:16.190 --> 03:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
of the mind that perhaps instead of the
 
03:08:18.790 --> 03:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
committee committing time over the
 
03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
summer on this maybe if you just met
 
03:08:24.229 --> 03:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
with Dees and got their feedback on it
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
um it just it's just an idea thank
 
03:08:31.950 --> 03:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
you anyone else representative Darby
 
03:08:33.190 --> 03:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
my question definitely I'm interested in
 
03:08:38.550 --> 03:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
understanding impacts you know where it
 
03:08:41.950 --> 03:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
may not look like areas or Wetlands um
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
so the you know the statute talks about
 
03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
P pervasive um vegetation in saturated
 
03:08:50.590 --> 03:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
soil can you can you describe a bit more
 
03:08:51.990 --> 03:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
that you know when you mention you're
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
driving up the road and you see a lot of
 
03:08:56.750 --> 03:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
areas marked off as um with pink flags
 
03:08:58.110 --> 03:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
which are marked as Wetlands can you
 
03:08:59.309 --> 03:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
describe a little bit more the
 
03:09:01.469 --> 03:09:01.479 align:start position:0%
characteristics of that area um thank
 
03:09:04.070 --> 03:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
you it is um essentially sort of the
 
03:09:06.150 --> 03:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
unimproved road shoulder where you have
 
03:09:08.429 --> 03:09:08.439 align:start position:0%
somebody's property that ends up dipping
 
03:09:09.990 --> 03:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
down a little bit before it goes over
 
03:09:12.510 --> 03:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
the hill um sometimes that is the area
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
that tends to naturally drain to
 
03:09:16.269 --> 03:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
whatever draining place there is but
 
03:09:17.870 --> 03:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
because there's been an uneven
 
03:09:19.870 --> 03:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
distribution of it you have something
 
03:09:21.630 --> 03:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
that would be a bit of a stream bed but
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's low points and then those low
 
03:09:25.830 --> 03:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
points within there because some seeds
 
03:09:27.590 --> 03:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
were able to germinate as you as you
 
03:09:29.229 --> 03:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
have the silt and everything else wash
 
03:09:30.910 --> 03:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
off you get to have good nutrients in
 
03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
those locations as well so you have
 
03:09:35.510 --> 03:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
small areas maybe this big that have
 
03:09:37.550 --> 03:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
some of those Wetlands type plants but
 
03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's simply because in the process of
 
03:09:41.990 --> 03:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
flowing to an area of drainage there was
 
03:09:43.990 --> 03:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
enough time for for it to sit and dwell
 
03:09:46.190 --> 03:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
so that you'd get a few plants but it's
 
03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
right on the roads side it's one where
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
there's not it's not a good location for
 
03:09:53.389 --> 03:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
any animals at all um and it's simply
 
03:09:55.269 --> 03:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
just sort of a failure of drainage we
 
03:09:57.710 --> 03:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
have quite a few coverts that have it
 
03:09:59.429 --> 03:09:59.439 align:start position:0%
seems that they've collapsed underneath
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
our road um I spoke to people in other
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
areas where um their towns continually
 
03:10:06.309 --> 03:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
sand their roads as opposed to plowing
 
03:10:08.590 --> 03:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
them and they built up over time so that
 
03:10:10.229 --> 03:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
what used to be able to flow in certain
 
03:10:12.269 --> 03:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
areas can't just because of that
 
03:10:15.469 --> 03:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
man-made distribution of materials so I
 
03:10:16.990 --> 03:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
my thought is to make sure that we can
 
03:10:19.429 --> 03:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
have a good way to deal with those areas
 
03:10:22.710 --> 03:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
that that really that really aren't a
 
03:10:24.910 --> 03:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
vibrant and healthy Wetlands but just
 
03:10:26.710 --> 03:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
happen to be saturated and happen to
 
03:10:29.309 --> 03:10:29.319 align:start position:0%
have caught and fostered some seeds um
 
03:10:31.630 --> 03:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we're not just incre
 
03:10:33.269 --> 03:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
that we're not focusing our resources in
 
03:10:35.309 --> 03:10:35.319 align:start position:0%
the wrong
 
03:10:38.990 --> 03:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:41.150 --> 03:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
else seeing no
 
03:10:43.990 --> 03:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
one thank you very much thank you and
 
03:10:44.990 --> 03:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go back over to my
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:54.670 --> 03:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
much call uh barene forest from New
 
03:10:54.680 --> 03:11:04.269 align:start position:0%
much call uh barene forest from New
Hampshire

03:11:04.269 --> 03:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:06.510 --> 03:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
Dees good afternoon my name is darling
 
03:11:07.950 --> 03:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
Forest the current Welton buau
 
03:11:09.110 --> 03:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
administrator at the New Hampshire
 
03:11:11.389 --> 03:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services I
 
03:11:13.990 --> 03:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
believe the department emailed a copy of
 
03:11:17.389 --> 03:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
its letter of testimony to folks
 
03:11:20.670 --> 03:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday um which hopefully you all
 
03:11:22.349 --> 03:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
have today since I've just realized I
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
have 40 copies of my letter of testimony
 
03:11:26.950 --> 03:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
for the Department for House Bill 1554
 
03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:32.510 --> 03:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
next um to summarize to summarize that
 
03:11:35.229 --> 03:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
letter and since I figured you they
 
03:11:37.950 --> 03:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
always give me a they always pass
 
03:11:41.030 --> 03:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
something around so my apologies I'm uh
 
03:11:43.469 --> 03:11:43.479 align:start position:0%
well prepared for the next hearing
 
03:11:47.349 --> 03:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
so the department uh is opposed to the
 
03:11:50.950 --> 03:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
legislation is crafted
 
03:11:54.269 --> 03:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm uh on behalf of the department it
 
03:11:55.990 --> 03:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
is good to hear that representative Lon
 
03:11:58.349 --> 03:11:58.359 align:start position:0%
has suggested uh possibly study so that
 
03:12:00.910 --> 03:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
we have time to work with her uh to
 
03:12:04.469 --> 03:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
determine what her concerns are our
 
03:12:06.550 --> 03:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
concerns with this legislation is that
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
the definition of
 
03:12:12.150 --> 03:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
wetland is an understood scientific
 
03:12:15.429 --> 03:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
definition it is a commonly
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
defined land form there is a uniform
 
03:12:21.349 --> 03:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
definition that's used primarily
 
03:12:24.229 --> 03:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
Nationwide please understand that while
 
03:12:26.469 --> 03:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
some folks May argue who's got
 
03:12:28.750 --> 03:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over one Wetland what
 
03:12:31.790 --> 03:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
wetlands in different states and all of
 
03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
that what is a wetland is not normally
 
03:12:38.070 --> 03:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
the argument that is a very consistent
 
03:12:40.349 --> 03:12:40.359 align:start position:0%
definition to say that something is a
 
03:12:43.190 --> 03:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
wetland unless it's caused caused by a
 
03:12:47.070 --> 03:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
certain matter or a certain situation it
 
03:12:50.590 --> 03:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
is still wet it is still that thing if
 
03:12:52.110 --> 03:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
we have a situation where we're arguing
 
03:12:54.429 --> 03:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
causality what that will do is create a
 
03:12:57.190 --> 03:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
lot of just arguments is there an
 
03:13:00.790 --> 03:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
advantage to arguing cause or not um do
 
03:13:03.150 --> 03:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
you need a permit or not how much of
 
03:13:04.750 --> 03:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
that Wetland is caused because of the
 
03:13:06.590 --> 03:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
roadway and how much of that Wetland was
 
03:13:10.190 --> 03:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
not and we spend a great deal of time
 
03:13:13.229 --> 03:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
arguing over essentially
 
03:13:15.150 --> 03:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
um what's going to come down to whether
 
03:13:16.510 --> 03:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
or not a permit is needed it doesn't
 
03:13:18.190 --> 03:13:18.200 align:start position:0%
change the way it functions in the world
 
03:13:19.830 --> 03:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change whether it is habitat
 
03:13:21.229 --> 03:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
or not it doesn't change whether it
 
03:13:24.030 --> 03:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
provides flood storage or nutrient
 
03:13:26.710 --> 03:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
attenuation or contaminant attenuation
 
03:13:28.750 --> 03:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
it still does those things the only
 
03:13:30.269 --> 03:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
difference in changing the definition
 
03:13:31.590 --> 03:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
would be determining whether or not it
 
03:13:33.710 --> 03:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
falls under our
 
03:13:35.429 --> 03:13:35.439 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction on whether or not you need
 
03:13:38.710 --> 03:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
a permit so the effective way to do that
 
03:13:41.349 --> 03:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
isn't to change the definition if if the
 
03:13:43.030 --> 03:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
legislature ever determined there's a
 
03:13:45.630 --> 03:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
need for something to not need a
 
03:13:49.309 --> 03:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
permit then call it what it is but
 
03:13:51.910 --> 03:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
simply say this activity or this thing
 
03:13:54.750 --> 03:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't need a permit so the way the
 
03:13:57.269 --> 03:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
methodology for this bill was our
 
03:13:59.030 --> 03:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
primary concern it was it seemed
 
03:13:59.040 --> 03:14:00.110 align:start position:0%
primary concern it was it seemed
technically

03:14:00.110 --> 03:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
technically
 
03:14:03.790 --> 03:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
flawed um and in doing in developing
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
that analysis we did have to presume
 
03:14:07.590 --> 03:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat what representative lon's
 
03:14:09.030 --> 03:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
intent was it sounds like we may have
 
03:14:11.309 --> 03:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
presumed a little bit wrong we look
 
03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
forward as I said earlier to to working
 
03:14:16.269 --> 03:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
with her um in the
 
03:14:19.830 --> 03:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
future so that's that's the
 
03:14:23.150 --> 03:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
general position of the department
 
03:14:28.190 --> 03:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
um this is just not it's a it's going
 
03:14:31.349 --> 03:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
to it's going to provide an additional
 
03:14:33.950 --> 03:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
reason to argue about something with
 
03:14:37.389 --> 03:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
very little beneficial outcome at the
 
03:14:40.030 --> 03:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
end so we would prefer if this goes
 
03:14:42.150 --> 03:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
forward if if that is an intent a
 
03:14:42.160 --> 03:14:44.710 align:start position:0%
forward if if that is an intent a
different

03:14:44.710 --> 03:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:48.349 --> 03:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
method I'll ask myself a question
 
03:14:52.469 --> 03:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
first uh there are certain exceptions
 
03:14:56.070 --> 03:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
that to the wetlands uh I think Farm
 
03:14:59.030 --> 03:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
ponds if I'm not mistaken are exe ex
 
03:15:02.950 --> 03:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
except Exempted from uh uh some of the
 
03:15:06.110 --> 03:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
regulations around that there are
 
03:15:09.990 --> 03:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions of my am I correct there are
 
03:15:11.830 --> 03:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
many there are exemptions by Statute and
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
exemptions by rule as well okay uh maybe
 
03:15:17.349 --> 03:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
if you could go over a little bit more
 
03:15:22.990 --> 03:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
what they might be uh so as an example
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
so exemptions usually focus on
 
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
activities so the cleaning of culverts
 
03:15:30.309 --> 03:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
is Exempted the maintenance of farm
 
03:15:33.550 --> 03:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
ponds storm water ponds fire
 
03:15:37.110 --> 03:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
ponds water conveyance systems all of
 
03:15:38.990 --> 03:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
those things are Exempted from permits
 
03:15:40.990 --> 03:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
certain types of Maintenance of seaw
 
03:15:42.750 --> 03:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
walls are Exempted from the the need for
 
03:15:42.760 --> 03:15:43.590 align:start position:0%
walls are Exempted from the the need for
a

03:15:43.590 --> 03:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:15:48.590 --> 03:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
permit there are um exemption by rule we
 
03:15:50.590 --> 03:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
have exemptions that require simple
 
03:15:54.830 --> 03:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
notification for geotechnical borings
 
03:15:58.510 --> 03:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
for um emergencies for oil remediation
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
activities if there's something where
 
03:16:03.590 --> 03:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
for instance you have an oil spill we
 
03:16:05.309 --> 03:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
don't want you getting a wetland permit
 
03:16:07.309 --> 03:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
before you go in and clean it up if
 
03:16:10.910 --> 03:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
you're um anytime you're working under
 
03:16:14.550 --> 03:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
their directive I would direct you to if
 
03:16:15.990 --> 03:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
you want to read the whole list the
 
03:16:18.229 --> 03:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
world's longest uncomfortable sentence
 
03:16:20.870 --> 03:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
it is RSA
 
03:16:23.710 --> 03:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
42a colon
 
03:16:27.790 --> 03:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
3 I believe it's Roman numeral 4 A B and
 
03:16:34.389 --> 03:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:40.189 --> 03:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
law and as a follow on to that uh is
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:16:41.279 --> 03:16:42.910 align:start position:0%
there is
this

03:16:42.910 --> 03:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:16:47.070 --> 03:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
issue around uh encroaching Wetlands
 
03:16:49.469 --> 03:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
where or developing
 
03:16:52.910 --> 03:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
Wetlands where Wetlands uh where you
 
03:16:56.950 --> 03:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
have not no wetlands and then water
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
maybe drainage starts a wetland at what
 
03:17:05.070 --> 03:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
point can you say stop the Wetland and
 
03:17:08.790 --> 03:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
return it to what it was originally so
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
if you have an if you have an area
 
03:17:13.229 --> 03:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
understand that there are three criteria
 
03:17:15.990 --> 03:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
under the definition to delineate a
 
03:17:18.429 --> 03:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
wetland one of those is soil chemistry
 
03:17:20.269 --> 03:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
you need to have the hydrology present
 
03:17:22.110 --> 03:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
and it has to be present long enough to
 
03:17:25.189 --> 03:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
affect the soil chemistry which will
 
03:17:27.910 --> 03:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
then affect the type of plants that can
 
03:17:31.429 --> 03:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
grow there it takes a few years before
 
03:17:35.150 --> 03:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
soil chemistry actually shows physical
 
03:17:37.269 --> 03:17:37.279 align:start position:0%
changes that you would need to delineate
 
03:17:40.309 --> 03:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
something out as a jurisdictional
 
03:17:43.269 --> 03:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
wetland so at any any point in those
 
03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
years to correct that you you should um
 
03:17:51.229 --> 03:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
if you have a situation where for
 
03:17:53.710 --> 03:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
instance culverts need to be resized or
 
03:17:53.720 --> 03:17:55.229 align:start position:0%
instance culverts need to be resized or
culverts

03:17:55.229 --> 03:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
culverts
 
03:17:59.189 --> 03:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
collapsed if you maintain that CT and
 
03:18:01.830 --> 03:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
now you allow proper passage of water
 
03:18:03.429 --> 03:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
then that water isn't building up there
 
03:18:05.750 --> 03:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
so that chemistry even if it has begun
 
03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
to show hydr
 
03:18:09.630 --> 03:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
characteristics will then begin to
 
03:18:13.550 --> 03:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
revert back to its its normal more
 
03:18:15.830 --> 03:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
oxidized physical characteristics in
 
03:18:18.590 --> 03:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
chemistry and won't come back as as a
 
03:18:22.429 --> 03:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
wetland soil so timing varies on a
 
03:18:24.429 --> 03:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
number of things mostly associated with
 
03:18:27.309 --> 03:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
soil chemistry and plant
 
03:18:29.630 --> 03:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
responsiveness but it usually takes
 
03:18:33.990 --> 03:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:37.189 --> 03:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
changes thank you representative Darby
 
03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
you have a question thank you Mr chair
 
03:18:42.910 --> 03:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
so what um
 
03:18:45.389 --> 03:18:45.399 align:start position:0%
what does
 
03:18:48.309 --> 03:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
the taking representative lons um
 
03:18:50.429 --> 03:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
scenario where there's some work going
 
03:18:51.910 --> 03:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
on and they they need to Mark the
 
03:18:54.269 --> 03:18:54.279 align:start position:0%
wetlands on the side what impact is that
 
03:18:57.110 --> 03:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to say the construction on
 
03:18:59.309 --> 03:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
that road where let's say there's a
 
03:19:02.309 --> 03:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
drainage ditch and some areas have had
 
03:19:05.070 --> 03:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
depressions for years as you mentioned
 
03:19:07.870 --> 03:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
and so there's so what what's the goal
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
of of treating those as
 
03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:15.630 align:start position:0%
of of treating those as
wetlands

03:19:15.630 --> 03:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:17.670 --> 03:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
so in treating those as Wetland it
 
03:19:18.950 --> 03:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
depends on whether or not it's an
 
03:19:20.790 --> 03:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
existing highway or you're maintaining a
 
03:19:20.800 --> 03:19:21.710 align:start position:0%
existing highway or you're maintaining a
new

03:19:21.710 --> 03:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:19:24.710 --> 03:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
highway when you have Roadside ditches
 
03:19:26.750 --> 03:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
or roadside depressions that are
 
03:19:29.150 --> 03:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
collecting water the questions there are
 
03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
several um questions that would come up
 
03:19:32.640 --> 03:19:34.030 align:start position:0%
several um questions that would come up
such

03:19:34.030 --> 03:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
such
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
as is this you have nutrient attenuation
 
03:19:39.150 --> 03:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of our roads because they're
 
03:19:42.189 --> 03:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
historic they don't have um storm Water
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
Management they weren't built at a time
 
03:19:45.550 --> 03:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
when storm water management was
 
03:19:47.389 --> 03:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
something that was considered all of
 
03:19:50.110 --> 03:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
that road salt all of the stuff that's
 
03:19:53.070 --> 03:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
getting washed off your car or falling
 
03:19:55.870 --> 03:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
off your vehicle that is going into
 
03:19:58.590 --> 03:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
those roadside Wetlands which then those
 
03:20:01.710 --> 03:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
chemicals are broken down and attenuated
 
03:20:03.830 --> 03:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
in those roadside Wetlands those
 
03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
roadside Wetlands serve as flood
 
03:20:09.510 --> 03:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
storage for all of that runoff if it's
 
03:20:11.550 --> 03:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
not going to a detention Basin that
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
gives where you have the impervious
 
03:20:15.150 --> 03:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
surface which isn't just the pavement
 
03:20:17.710 --> 03:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
you need to compact your road base so
 
03:20:20.030 --> 03:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
that your road base is solid those
 
03:20:23.710 --> 03:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
compacted soils and the pavement itself
 
03:20:26.070 --> 03:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
is not taking in water anymore it won't
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
let water infiltrate so you need those
 
03:20:32.469 --> 03:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
adjacent Wetlands to give that water a
 
03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
chance to infiltrate back into a
 
03:20:38.229 --> 03:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
groundwater system and be treated as it
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
does so so it's filtering out some of
 
03:20:42.750 --> 03:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
the chemicals and the nutrients they do
 
03:20:46.710 --> 03:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
provide some some habitat value which is
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
kind of a catch22 will be the first to
 
03:20:50.510 --> 03:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
admit it because on one hand you want
 
03:20:52.150 --> 03:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
that habitat on the other hand you don't
 
03:20:54.150 --> 03:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
want it on the road
 
03:20:57.110 --> 03:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
because the the animals don't seem to do
 
03:20:58.349 --> 03:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
very well out
 
03:21:01.550 --> 03:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
there so it it does provide a certain
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
amount of habitat some of the most
 
03:21:05.110 --> 03:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
valuable habitat we have in New
 
03:21:07.229 --> 03:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is always at risk is
 
03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
vernal pools which are a simple
 
03:21:11.189 --> 03:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
ephemeral pool they tend to show up in
 
03:21:12.750 --> 03:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
the spring
 
03:21:16.790 --> 03:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
that are key habitat types
 
03:21:19.910 --> 03:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
for uh certain reptile and amphibian
 
03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
species that are the start of the food
 
03:21:24.229 --> 03:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
chain those are hard to
 
03:21:26.590 --> 03:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
recreate but strangely as much as
 
03:21:29.670 --> 03:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
they're difficult to recreate on
 
03:21:32.189 --> 03:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
purpose they tend to just accidentally
 
03:21:35.469 --> 03:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
happen in logging roads and roadside
 
03:21:37.990 --> 03:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
depressions in part because there is no
 
03:21:40.670 --> 03:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
one going out there because you're in
 
03:21:43.070 --> 03:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
the roadway rideway or nearby it's
 
03:21:45.469 --> 03:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
someplace that doesn't get the
 
03:21:47.469 --> 03:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
activity uh and it tends to get good
 
03:21:49.269 --> 03:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
light so you have the shrubby growth
 
03:21:50.990 --> 03:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
that you might need for some of these
 
03:21:54.790 --> 03:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
these Critters to use as cover in that
 
03:21:57.630 --> 03:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
habitat so there's there's any number of
 
03:22:00.550 --> 03:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
things and values that these roadside
 
03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
habitats or any other incidental
 
03:22:07.630 --> 03:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
habitats can use one of the things that
 
03:22:10.349 --> 03:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
uh we are looking at moving forward we
 
03:22:14.990 --> 03:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
at Dees um are starting within for those
 
03:22:17.630 --> 03:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
who didn't know the New Hampshire GE
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
geological section is embedded at Dees
 
03:22:23.349 --> 03:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
they are embarking on a study to assist
 
03:22:25.870 --> 03:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
towns with planning for asset by asset I
 
03:22:28.030 --> 03:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
mean Culvert
 
03:22:30.070 --> 03:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
replacement where on one hand everybody
 
03:22:31.790 --> 03:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
thinks it's a good idea to upssize your
 
03:22:34.229 --> 03:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
Culvert so they pass water better you
 
03:22:36.150 --> 03:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
want to pass that water quickly on the
 
03:22:38.229 --> 03:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
other hand sometimes by downsizing a
 
03:22:41.309 --> 03:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
culvert you hold water back and what
 
03:22:43.110 --> 03:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
that does is it slows down the
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
progression of a flood through it
 
03:22:47.070 --> 03:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
creates flood storage higher in the
 
03:22:49.950 --> 03:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
Watershed so you know some of these
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
projects some of these older road
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
projects is in fact a can provide a
 
03:22:58.110 --> 03:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which to create flood
 
03:23:01.030 --> 03:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
storage control and capacity and that is
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
something that we will be working with
 
03:23:04.870 --> 03:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
um to develop tools for the town to help
 
03:23:06.990 --> 03:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
them integrate that as part of their
 
03:23:09.790 --> 03:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
flood resiliency Pro uh planning and
 
03:23:12.750 --> 03:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
programming moving forward so that's
 
03:23:15.309 --> 03:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most overlooked
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
aspects of these areas is just flood
 
03:23:19.870 --> 03:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
storage if that water is ponded there
 
03:23:21.790 --> 03:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
then it's not in the Stream and it's not
 
03:23:24.309 --> 03:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
contributing to the flood it's it's that
 
03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:29.389 --> 03:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
important any other questions
 
03:23:29.399 --> 03:23:31.790 align:start position:0%
important any other questions
representative

03:23:31.790 --> 03:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:23:34.269 --> 03:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
Bale thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:23:37.750 --> 03:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
for um taking my question so I'm
 
03:23:39.870 --> 03:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about this little area um in
 
03:23:41.630 --> 03:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
NASA where there's a Circ
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
circumferential Highway at the south end
 
03:23:47.790 --> 03:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
and where they have built the road up
 
03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
around it there is a natural depression
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
and there's quite a vibrant little
 
03:23:54.349 --> 03:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
Wildlife um biome going on there because
 
03:23:57.189 --> 03:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
there's a wetland that was created so
 
03:23:58.990 --> 03:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
this is something that we would want
 
03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:02.269 align:start position:0%
this is something that we would want
isn't

03:24:02.269 --> 03:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:04.469 --> 03:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
it that Wetland May well have been
 
03:24:06.710 --> 03:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
created with intent when the road was
 
03:24:10.269 --> 03:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
built as a precisely for for the flood
 
03:24:12.030 --> 03:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
storage and infiltration purpose purp
 
03:24:14.910 --> 03:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
that is a when we work with DOT as part
 
03:24:17.030 --> 03:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
of their roadway design that is
 
03:24:18.990 --> 03:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
something that we actively ask them to
 
03:24:22.510 --> 03:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
work in is areas for collection of storm
 
03:24:27.349 --> 03:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
water and infiltration and treatment so
 
03:24:30.590 --> 03:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
yes any other
 
03:24:32.550 --> 03:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
03:24:36.870 --> 03:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:36.880 --> 03:24:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
much

members of the committee for hearing us
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
today my name is Kimberly peace I am the
 
03:25:08.670 --> 03:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
chair of the legislative committee for

the New Hampshire Association of natural
 
03:25:13.510 --> 03:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
resource scientists we go by the
 
03:25:16.389 --> 03:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
shorthand of nanners and new Hamp and
 
03:25:19.790 --> 03:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
nanners is the um sorry let me get my
 
03:25:22.550 --> 03:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
notes straight A Statewide nonprofit
 
03:25:24.150 --> 03:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
Professional Organization whose
 
03:25:26.229 --> 03:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
membership includes Wetland scientists
 
03:25:28.590 --> 03:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
soil scientists and Wildlife biologists
 
03:25:29.910 --> 03:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
from the professional Consulting
 
03:25:31.790 --> 03:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
Community from the state's academic and
 
03:25:34.150 --> 03:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
public sectors there are over 300
 
03:25:35.910 --> 03:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
practicing certified we and scientists
 
03:25:37.750 --> 03:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and we serve as
 
03:25:39.870 --> 03:25:39.880 align:start position:0%

03:25:42.269 --> 03:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
state and federal government officials
 
03:25:43.950 --> 03:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
and we assist in balancing wise growth
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
and development Environmental Protection
 
03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
and the rights of private property
 
03:25:49.110 --> 03:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
owners and we assist them with our
 
03:25:51.189 --> 03:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
technical expertise founded on
 
03:25:54.550 --> 03:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
scientific principles so the I the group
 
03:25:56.349 --> 03:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
that I'm here to speak with they are the
 
03:25:57.870 --> 03:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
people who would take go out in the
 
03:26:00.110 --> 03:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
field and um as representative Leighton
 
03:26:02.030 --> 03:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
said um Place those pink flags and
 
03:26:03.710 --> 03:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
identify the wetlands we call it Wetland
 
03:26:05.630 --> 03:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
delineation where's the Wetland and
 
03:26:07.110 --> 03:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
where's the Upland and where's the line
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
in between those those resources and
 
03:26:11.590 --> 03:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
we're here to comment on this bill
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
because we um as uh Miss Force said so
 
03:26:17.910 --> 03:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
eloquently uh a wetland is a resource it
 
03:26:19.710 --> 03:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
is a land form and it is a
 
03:26:21.910 --> 03:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
well-established resource that is
 
03:26:24.670 --> 03:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
defined by soils hydrology and presence
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
of vegetation and so because that
 
03:26:29.550 --> 03:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
definition is so well-versed um
 
03:26:32.790 --> 03:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
Nationwide it there's there's no um
 
03:26:35.550 --> 03:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
rationale behind what caused the Wetland
 
03:26:39.030 --> 03:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
or how it Formed it simply is or is not
 
03:26:41.790 --> 03:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
a wetland and and the identification of
 
03:26:43.830 --> 03:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
a wetland is different as she spoke on
 
03:26:46.429 --> 03:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
to the jurisdiction of a wetland so
 
03:26:48.429 --> 03:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
there are wetlands and then there is
 
03:26:50.429 --> 03:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over whether or not you
 
03:26:53.389 --> 03:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
need a permit or how or if you can
 
03:26:55.110 --> 03:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
develop that Wetland or do certain
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
activities in or around those Wetlands
 
03:26:58.910 --> 03:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
but none of that speaks to the
 
03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
definition of wetlands and while um
 
03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
culverts are a challenge in situations
 
03:27:07.309 --> 03:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
where they become blocked um they can
 
03:27:09.349 --> 03:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
create a wetland that can be valuable or
 
03:27:11.550 --> 03:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
they can be a challenge and there are
 
03:27:13.269 --> 03:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
certain situations you know can be
 
03:27:15.550 --> 03:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
looked at from good or bad um but the
 
03:27:17.189 --> 03:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
the fact that whether it's a wetland or
 
03:27:18.750 --> 03:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
not is just simply based on those three
 
03:27:21.389 --> 03:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
parameters so we uh understand that
 
03:27:22.830 --> 03:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
there are concerns that there are
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
wetlands within the state that may seem
 
03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
low functioning or may seem um to have
 
03:27:30.990 --> 03:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
popped up sort of for um man-made
 
03:27:33.870 --> 03:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
reasons the fact is that those um
 
03:27:36.309 --> 03:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
situations can be dealt with either
 
03:27:38.309 --> 03:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
through legislative um through rul
 
03:27:40.630 --> 03:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
making or through guidance or exemptions
 
03:27:42.110 --> 03:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
and there are currently lots of
 
03:27:44.830 --> 03:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
exemptions available to um clean out
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
culs or to unblock culverts um as needed
 
03:27:51.550 --> 03:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
and as as as is um in a way that gets
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
looked at in a positive way so that that
 
03:27:55.389 --> 03:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
the whole situation gets looked at
 
03:27:57.990 --> 03:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
before um before the certified Wetland
 
03:27:59.469 --> 03:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
scientist has to stand in the field and
 
03:28:01.670 --> 03:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
say is this a resource or is it not and
 
03:28:04.070 --> 03:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
and what is its cause that that second
 
03:28:06.189 --> 03:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
step is just not part of that
 
03:28:09.150 --> 03:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
delineation process and we feel strongly
 
03:28:11.910 --> 03:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
that that would be um sort of mixing up
 
03:28:13.389 --> 03:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
the process of identifying what a
 
03:28:15.910 --> 03:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
wetland is in the field versus how you
 
03:28:17.550 --> 03:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
deal with the jurisdiction and
 
03:28:20.189 --> 03:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
permitting that might come from that um
 
03:28:22.910 --> 03:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
the potential alteration or impacts to
 
03:28:25.550 --> 03:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
those Wetlands so we just wanted to send
 
03:28:27.870 --> 03:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh myself to today to hear what was said
 
03:28:29.189 --> 03:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
here today in the committee into here
 
03:28:31.349 --> 03:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative Leighton um you know and
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
as she pointed out there have been
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
Wetlands that have been created that and
 
03:28:39.189 --> 03:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
per this rule change could even be um
 
03:28:40.830 --> 03:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
considered not a wetland and that's
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
that's not not really the case in hand
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
the case is um really what we tend to do
 
03:28:47.189 --> 03:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
or what we want to do as a state with
 
03:28:49.309 --> 03:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
Wetlands where there could be blocked
 
03:28:52.389 --> 03:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
culs or cul issues which could be
 
03:28:54.269 --> 03:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
changed or not and it and it really I
 
03:28:55.790 --> 03:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
think the whole picture has to be looked
 
03:28:57.990 --> 03:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
at and I don't think that the solution
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
is by changing the definition of
 
03:29:07.070 --> 03:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:12.349 --> 03:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
committee seeing no one oh
 
03:29:14.830 --> 03:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr can you just um tell me uh

it is the New Hampshire Association of
 
03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
natural resource scientists thank
 
03:29:24.750 --> 03:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
you that
 
03:29:28.510 --> 03:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
it thank you thank you very
 
03:29:31.990 --> 03:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
much have no more pink
 
03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
cards uh any else one else uh want to
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
have a speak on this or have a uh we me
 
03:29:45.790 --> 03:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
let me ask take Now personal privilege
 
03:29:49.670 --> 03:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
on this as a chair
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh there is a you you heard
 
03:29:55.469 --> 03:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh Leon ask
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
about uh you know having this be
 
03:30:03.790 --> 03:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:06.750 --> 03:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
study maybe I should ask representative
 
03:30:09.389 --> 03:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
Force representative for I just I just

committee spend time working on that uh
 
03:30:41.790 --> 03:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
on the on the uh on this issue or would
 
03:30:44.870 --> 03:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
you rather have uh representative
 
03:30:46.830 --> 03:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
Leighton spend time with you working on
 
03:30:46.840 --> 03:30:48.790 align:start position:0%
Leighton spend time with you working on
the

03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:30:52.030 --> 03:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
issue for us as Department I don't know
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
that it please don't be offended I don't
 
03:30:57.269 --> 03:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
know that it matters much if you have a
 
03:31:00.189 --> 03:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
formal committee or or not if there's
 
03:31:02.830 --> 03:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
any group of legislators who wants to
 
03:31:03.910 --> 03:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
work with
 
03:31:06.469 --> 03:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
us we're not going to say
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
no no what I'm talking about being being
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
just being effective knowing how INE
 
03:31:12.750 --> 03:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
effective we can be at
 
03:31:12.760 --> 03:31:15.590 align:start position:0%
effective we can be at
times

03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
times
 
03:31:19.269 --> 03:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
so it's up to it's up to the comme
 
03:31:19.279 --> 03:31:21.830 align:start position:0%
so it's up to it's up to the comme
whether

03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
whether
 
03:31:24.790 --> 03:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
keep you have that structure and you
 
03:31:27.349 --> 03:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
feel provit to you as a
 
03:31:27.359 --> 03:31:34.229 align:start position:0%
feel provit to you as a
committee

yeah I
 
03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%

yeah

04:03:06.750 --> 04:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:09.309 --> 04:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
and house bill
 
04:03:15.149 --> 04:03:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:18.030 --> 04:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
Coker the floor is
 
04:03:20.710 --> 04:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
yours thank you very much Mr chairman um
 
04:03:23.790 --> 04:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 1542 is a pretty simple
 
04:03:28.070 --> 04:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
bill um basically it allows you to have
 
04:03:31.550 --> 04:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
a photographic copy of your Boer Safety
 
04:03:35.710 --> 04:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
license so um the the Genesis of this
 
04:03:38.670 --> 04:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
came I'm part of a boat club and we all
 
04:03:41.710 --> 04:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
use different boats and uh somebody was
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
saying how it it stinks that they can't
 
04:03:46.910 --> 04:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
just have the uh their boter certificate
 
04:03:48.309 --> 04:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
on their phone and be able to show a
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
copy if the Marine Patrol pulls you over
 
04:03:51.269 --> 04:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
so technically you're supposed to have
 
04:03:53.429 --> 04:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
that on you um if it's if you're
 
04:03:57.149 --> 04:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
operating a a vehicle over 25 horsepower
 
04:03:59.189 --> 04:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
so basically this law would allow you to
 
04:04:00.750 --> 04:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
just put it get a copy of it on your
 
04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
phone and um that would be it that would
 
04:04:06.189 --> 04:04:06.199 align:start position:0%
just satisfy that law um I have an
 
04:04:08.349 --> 04:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to this because I C talk to a
 
04:04:11.070 --> 04:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
captain dunlevy and basically he said
 
04:04:12.389 --> 04:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
that there's a barcode on the back
 
04:04:14.429 --> 04:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
that's very important so it would be the
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
front and the back and I tried to get
 
04:04:18.149 --> 04:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
that printed out but I was uh I don't
 
04:04:19.309 --> 04:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
have power at my house because they're
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
putting in fiber optic cabl so as I was
 
04:04:23.229 --> 04:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
running out the door I was like now
 
04:04:25.269 --> 04:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
there goes my plan so I I put in a
 
04:04:26.950 --> 04:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
request to get it printed but it should
 
04:04:28.389 --> 04:04:28.399 align:start position:0%
be ready to
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
go so that's about it it's pretty simple
 
04:04:31.680 --> 04:04:34.189 align:start position:0%
go so that's about it it's pretty simple
okay

04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:04:36.429 --> 04:04:36.439 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:04:38.030 --> 04:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Koker for taking my
 
04:04:41.110 --> 04:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
question so I just wanted to ascertain
 
04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
now this is a certificate that you
 
04:04:47.630 --> 04:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
physically carry but you also have a
 
04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
digital copy on your
 
04:04:52.469 --> 04:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
phone so so what this would do is that
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to you wouldn't have
 
04:04:55.630 --> 04:04:55.640 align:start position:0%
to physically carry it anymore you just
 
04:04:57.189 --> 04:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
have a c you could have a copy on your
 
04:04:59.469 --> 04:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
phone and that would would satisfy the
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
law because right now a lot of people
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't actually have it on them and they
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
have 48 hours to to provide the
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
information to the Marine Patrol
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
so representative R thank you Mr chair
 
04:05:15.389 --> 04:05:15.399 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I'm
 
04:05:17.189 --> 04:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
reading the bill representative Coker
 
04:05:20.110 --> 04:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm it seems pretty clear that it
 
04:05:22.110 --> 04:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
says the certificate shall be a physical
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
original or copy or an electronic copy
 
04:05:27.670 --> 04:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
or a photograph of the certificate on
 
04:05:30.550 --> 04:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
electronic device
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
so I mean does that already kind of
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
imply that is both sides and by the way
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
I actually have mine so if anybody wants
 
04:05:43.830 --> 04:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
to see it that's what it looks like um
 
04:05:46.149 --> 04:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
can I see one I don't I don't have a
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
boat as a person without a boat but I I
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know it is boatless I mean it is a
 
04:05:55.110 --> 04:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
good idea because most people keep like
 
04:05:56.950 --> 04:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
I pulled it out of my wallet but I'm not
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to take my wallet on the boat
 
04:06:01.630 --> 04:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
because my luck it would fall over so
 
04:06:04.269 --> 04:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
but the way I'm reading the bill
 
04:06:06.429 --> 04:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
though and maybe this will be a good
 
04:06:08.910 --> 04:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
question for Captain dun love but it it
 
04:06:10.110 --> 04:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
appears to me if you're going to have a
 
04:06:12.469 --> 04:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
copy of it it would be both
 
04:06:16.389 --> 04:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
sides yeah I mean I just wanted to just
 
04:06:18.910 --> 04:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
for for the Marine Patrol because I
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
he'll be able to testify a little bit
 
04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
more to to the convenience of it but I
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
just wanted it to be clear for people it
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
is the front and back I just want to
 
04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
make that 100% clear okay thank
 
04:06:33.269 --> 04:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
you just just in looking at that it
 
04:06:36.510 --> 04:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
appeared to be more than a UPC it was it
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
looked like to be the computer thing a
 
04:06:42.429 --> 04:06:42.439 align:start position:0%
barcode yeah yeah reader that it reads
 
04:06:44.429 --> 04:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
same thing that you have on a TV screen
 
04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
if you want to buy
 
04:06:47.120 --> 04:06:49.389 align:start position:0%
if you want to buy
something

04:06:49.389 --> 04:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
yeah oh okay hey we got two all right
 
04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
none of you guys are going to be able to
 
04:06:56.590 --> 04:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
have your
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
Bo it's coming back to you it's coming
 
04:07:06.389 --> 04:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:09.870 --> 04:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:11.229 --> 04:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
all right is and that's and that's
 
04:07:12.990 --> 04:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment that's that that
 
04:07:16.830 --> 04:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
I've already had made up I just I I did
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
not I didn't even think about my power
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
being out when I went to go print it and
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
then I so I requested a print but it
 
04:07:26.510 --> 04:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't been enough filled yet so okay uh
 
04:07:29.070 --> 04:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Donnelly then
 
04:07:33.790 --> 04:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
representative Darby the
 
04:07:37.550 --> 04:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
D's thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
04:07:40.149 --> 04:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I have a boat and
 
04:07:41.670 --> 04:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
actually what's funny is my license is
 
04:07:43.229 --> 04:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
actually shrink wrapped with my boat
 
04:07:45.149 --> 04:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
right now uh cuz I don't ever take it
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
out of the boat I leave it with the boat
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
how often do you just a question for you
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
how often do you switch um vessels I
 
04:07:55.790 --> 04:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
switch boats all the time because I we
 
04:07:59.109 --> 04:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
we we have a boat club so we we tend to
 
04:08:00.870 --> 04:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
just take whatever boat's available and
 
04:08:02.590 --> 04:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
then normally we go to my buddy's Dock
 
04:08:04.750 --> 04:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
and then he has jet skis so we go off
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
and do that so I am constantly on and
 
04:08:10.750 --> 04:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
off of different boats U personally and
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
it was one of those things that just got
 
04:08:12.910 --> 04:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
brought up and a bunch of people are
 
04:08:14.189 --> 04:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
like yeah that would be that would be
 
04:08:16.510 --> 04:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
awesome so it's just I think it's just
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's an easy convenience and if it
 
04:08:20.109 --> 04:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't inconvenience the Marine Patrol
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
and doesn't make a difference I think
 
04:08:26.469 --> 04:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:30.030 --> 04:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
it representative Derby but you add next
 
04:08:31.630 --> 04:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
and then repres
 
04:08:33.790 --> 04:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:08:37.109 --> 04:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so um I
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
totally makees sense to me I just want
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
to say like this does allow for a copy
 
04:08:44.870 --> 04:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about water and I
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
could imagine that somebody has a paper
 
04:08:51.269 --> 04:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
copy right and and it gets wet and now
 
04:08:53.670 --> 04:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
you can't read the bird code anymore so
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
you might think about if you're me
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
amending it anyway to have like a
 
04:08:58.269 --> 04:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
legible copy especially since that
 
04:09:01.389 --> 04:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
barcode is very important yeah I'm I'm
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
open to whatever friendly amendments the
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee wants to uh put on to it I
 
04:09:08.469 --> 04:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
mean the the thing is one thing to think
 
04:09:10.229 --> 04:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
about is that already a lot of people
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
just don't carry it on them a lot of
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
people I've talked about this with are
 
04:09:14.309 --> 04:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
like oh I have to carry that I didn't
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
realize I have to carry that so um
 
04:09:18.990 --> 04:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
that's one thing to think about is it's
 
04:09:21.910 --> 04:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
better to have something other than
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
nothing I mean there is an electronic
 
04:09:26.149 --> 04:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
copy in your
 
04:09:28.349 --> 04:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
build what was that did you talk were
 
04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
you just saying electronic copy well
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
this the first Clause is a physical Co
 
04:09:36.590 --> 04:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
original or copy and so that copy to me
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
means to me a paper copy copy and could
 
04:09:41.830 --> 04:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
be like a photoc copy and I'm just
 
04:09:43.710 --> 04:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
thinking I could imagine making a bunch
 
04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
of these copies and putting them like
 
04:09:47.070 --> 04:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
any place you might need them but then
 
04:09:50.109 --> 04:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
they might get wet and so it's if they
 
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
really need to scan the thing and it's
 
04:09:53.149 --> 04:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
wet it's not going to be scanned so
 
04:09:54.630 --> 04:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's why I was just thinking it could
 
04:09:58.229 --> 04:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
you might want to clarify that the um
 
04:10:01.070 --> 04:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
certific the label has the um barcode
 
04:10:04.109 --> 04:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
has to be legible has to be legible
 
04:10:07.790 --> 04:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative wolf thank you Mr
 
04:10:10.750 --> 04:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um a question directed to the
 
04:10:14.630 --> 04:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
chairman um is this something that
 
04:10:17.710 --> 04:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
should go through legislation or should
 
04:10:21.870 --> 04:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
it be um done through rules in case
 
04:10:25.309 --> 04:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
something happens down the road that it
 
04:10:28.550 --> 04:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
becomes I can Envision a you know a
 
04:10:30.429 --> 04:10:30.439 align:start position:0%
magnetic thing on the side of a boat or
 
04:10:32.189 --> 04:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
something like
 
04:10:32.199 --> 04:10:34.070 align:start position:0%
something like
that

04:10:34.070 --> 04:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:37.469 --> 04:10:37.479 align:start position:0%
uh well you can't do rules without
 
04:10:40.510 --> 04:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
legislation but uh you can do
 
04:10:43.630 --> 04:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
legislation without rules okay I think
 
04:10:45.870 --> 04:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
you need the rules I I would
 
04:10:49.830 --> 04:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
actually uh well when uh when uh Captain
 
04:10:52.950 --> 04:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
duny talk speaks maybe he he might be
 
04:10:55.710 --> 04:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
able to talk to us a little bit about
 
04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
the rules if any rules would be would be
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
required for this or could be or whether
 
04:11:05.070 --> 04:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
not this could be just done in rules but
 
04:11:06.910 --> 04:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
might might it might might clear
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
something up but I don't know it might
 
04:11:12.429 --> 04:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
answer your question okay thank
 
04:11:14.990 --> 04:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative Coker
 
04:11:21.630 --> 04:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
um can you just explain to me what
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
happens to the individual who is pulled
 
04:11:28.590 --> 04:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
over by Marine Patrol and who has 48
 
04:11:33.469 --> 04:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
hours to respond to a request for uh a
 
04:11:36.670 --> 04:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
driver a voter's license Captain Dum
 
04:11:37.950 --> 04:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
lovey would probably have a much better
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
answer I I know that you have 48 hours
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
to produce to produce your certificate
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
or your information that's that's yeah
 
04:11:47.149 --> 04:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
that's about what I know um show up
 
04:11:50.429 --> 04:11:50.439 align:start position:0%
somewhere and yeah yeah present yeah so
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
again this is just a real like it's it's
 
04:11:55.630 --> 04:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
just trying to make things a little bit
 
04:11:58.389 --> 04:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
clearer and and I know that the their
 
04:12:00.109 --> 04:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
practice is already pretty like they
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
don't give people too much of a hard
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
time for not having it on them on their
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
person but this is just to clarify it
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
because when I the way that I read the
 
04:12:09.149 --> 04:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
rules and I I kind of like to follow the
 
04:12:10.910 --> 04:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
rules especially when I'm out on the
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
boat is I have to have that on me so I
 
04:12:17.309 --> 04:12:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:19.510 --> 04:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
times anyone
 
04:12:22.670 --> 04:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
else seeing none have another question
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
out of curiosity how many B clubs are
 
04:12:26.590 --> 04:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
there I know we've spoken about this
 
04:12:28.750 --> 04:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
before are there are there several on
 
04:12:31.469 --> 04:12:31.479 align:start position:0%
Lake wiip pasak I think there's a yeah I
 
04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
think it it's sted to become more
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
popular um it's it's I I love it I mean
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't want to be an
 
04:12:39.550 --> 04:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
advertisement right now but it's I think
 
04:12:40.710 --> 04:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
it's gonna you're going to see more of
 
04:12:43.590 --> 04:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
that in the future I
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
believe any more
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
questions very much all right thank
 
04:13:00.269 --> 04:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
dunlevy good afternoon Mr chairman
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee my
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
name is Tim Dunley and I come before you
 
04:13:07.710 --> 04:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
this morning or this afternoon
 
04:13:09.149 --> 04:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
representing the department of safety
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol
 
04:13:13.990 --> 04:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
unit and uh on behalf of the department
 
04:13:15.910 --> 04:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
I wish to express to you that we are
 
04:13:18.670 --> 04:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
taking a neutral position on this bill
 
04:13:21.109 --> 04:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh we have uh spoken with representative
 
04:13:23.630 --> 04:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
Coker about our wishes and our concerns
 
04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
of just having the barcode as you all
 
04:13:28.950 --> 04:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
have now seen on the back of the card
 
04:13:31.830 --> 04:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
included and if I could uh just give a
 
04:13:33.389 --> 04:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
little background on on the reasoning
 
04:13:33.399 --> 04:13:34.590 align:start position:0%
little background on on the reasoning
for

04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:13:37.389 --> 04:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
that uh as many of you commit well been
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
quite a turnover with the committee but
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the past when when you folks as a
 
04:13:43.070 --> 04:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
committee have been out on patrol boats
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
and seen us in action you'll see that
 
04:13:47.590 --> 04:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
when our officer makes a boat stop their
 
04:13:50.349 --> 04:13:50.359 align:start position:0%
number one priority is really to have
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
their hands on the boat that they've
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
stopped to prevent the boats from
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
banging into each other and causing
 
04:13:57.109 --> 04:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
damage and doing a safety check and
 
04:13:58.830 --> 04:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
having an exchange with the occupants of
 
04:14:02.590 --> 04:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
that boat um is is a is a challenge
 
04:14:03.910 --> 04:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes depending upon weather
 
04:14:05.189 --> 04:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
condition and the size of the boat and
 
04:14:09.030 --> 04:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
so on the office is then responsible for
 
04:14:11.670 --> 04:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
documenting that contact with the public
 
04:14:14.309 --> 04:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
it may be just a safety check they
 
04:14:17.229 --> 04:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
stopped us wanting directions or perhaps
 
04:14:19.229 --> 04:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
it's a ticket maybe even leads to an
 
04:14:21.750 --> 04:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
arrest it's important for us to document
 
04:14:24.750 --> 04:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
who we've dealt with during that time
 
04:14:28.790 --> 04:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
and um anticipating technology and where
 
04:14:31.309 --> 04:14:31.319 align:start position:0%
it has gone for officers on the road and
 
04:14:34.109 --> 04:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
on the water we built in the barcode on
 
04:14:36.109 --> 04:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
the back of these cards that is the
 
04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
exact same barcode code on the back of
 
04:14:41.469 --> 04:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
our driver's licenses those barcodes
 
04:14:44.070 --> 04:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
allow us to take a handheld small
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
handheld scanner wave it over that
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
barcode and that immediately goes to our
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
laptops on the boats and uploads all
 
04:14:54.429 --> 04:14:54.439 align:start position:0%
that person's personal information so
 
04:14:57.870 --> 04:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
that it saves us the time from pushing
 
04:15:00.070 --> 04:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
away driving a short distance away
 
04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
riding on the high's legibly uh and then
 
04:15:06.149 --> 04:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
returning to that boat all taking time
 
04:15:08.670 --> 04:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
where now we can just scan this finish
 
04:15:10.269 --> 04:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
our business with the occupants of the
 
04:15:12.429 --> 04:15:12.439 align:start position:0%
boat and send them on their way saving a
 
04:15:14.670 --> 04:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time less Boat
 
04:15:17.710 --> 04:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
tobo contact everybody's a
 
04:15:20.030 --> 04:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
winner right now the law says you are
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
required to carry your certificate with
 
04:15:23.670 --> 04:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
you whenever you operate a boat greater
 
04:15:24.910 --> 04:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
than 25
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
horsepower we recognize that people do
 
04:15:29.870 --> 04:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
not carry this in their wallets all the
 
04:15:32.630 --> 04:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
time like they do their driver's license
 
04:15:35.429 --> 04:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
um because some days they may be on
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
their fishing boat ski Bo boat the next
 
04:15:39.070 --> 04:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
day they could be in their grandparents
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft whatever it might be
 
04:15:44.189 --> 04:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
these cards travel and sometimes they
 
04:15:46.630 --> 04:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
don't travel with a person who may not
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
even be carrying their wallet because
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
it's in the glove box of the vehicle and
 
04:15:53.070 --> 04:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
they're in their swim trunks out on the
 
04:15:55.149 --> 04:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
water even though the law says you have
 
04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
to have it we run into regularly people
 
04:16:01.109 --> 04:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
who don't for a variety of reasons that
 
04:16:04.229 --> 04:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
have no criminal intent behind them the
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
law then allows us to give that person
 
04:16:10.269 --> 04:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
48 hours to provide us with the
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
information when we do that we have that
 
04:16:14.750 --> 04:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
personto person contact and we say to
 
04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
them please however you send this
 
04:16:19.109 --> 04:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
information to us often times it's a
 
04:16:22.109 --> 04:16:22.119 align:start position:0%
text a photo or an email we ask them to
 
04:16:23.550 --> 04:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
include that
 
04:16:26.950 --> 04:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
barcode uh and so that's why we uh work
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
with representative Coker to to include
 
04:16:32.070 --> 04:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
that barcode language uh we realize
 
04:16:34.510 --> 04:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes they come laminated in a photo
 
04:16:36.990 --> 04:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
copy sometimes it's water log sometimes
 
04:16:39.670 --> 04:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's you are allowed to buy as many
 
04:16:43.309 --> 04:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
cards as you would like in your name um
 
04:16:46.349 --> 04:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
so there are a variety of solutions but
 
04:16:48.189 --> 04:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
for the solution that that comes before
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
you today um we're dealing with it now
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're accepting variations now we just
 
04:16:55.349 --> 04:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
would include if it's going to go into
 
04:16:57.750 --> 04:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
statute that that the language include
 
04:16:57.760 --> 04:16:58.670 align:start position:0%
statute that that the language include
that

04:16:58.670 --> 04:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:00.670 --> 04:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
barcode I'm happy to answer any
 
04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have any
 
04:17:06.510 --> 04:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
you Captain D lovey so if you're
 
04:17:10.269 --> 04:17:10.279 align:start position:0%
accepting it now you're accepting
 
04:17:13.229 --> 04:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
electronic copies now of it do you feel
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
like this legislation is not
 
04:17:20.070 --> 04:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
needed um I would I would
 
04:17:23.790 --> 04:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
um I would say that our common practice
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
is not going to result in anyone
 
04:17:27.790 --> 04:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
receiving a ticket
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
today whether or not you folks wish to
 
04:17:32.149 --> 04:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
move forward with this bill just to get
 
04:17:35.309 --> 04:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
it in writing to ensure that that option
 
04:17:37.990 --> 04:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
exists I I I would defer to you folks I
 
04:17:42.550 --> 04:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
way representative fail thank you Mr
 
04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you Captain for taking my
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
question so I'm just looking so I looked
 
04:17:52.550 --> 04:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
at the card it went around it's a
 
04:17:55.189 --> 04:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
certification for boater operation it's
 
04:17:56.389 --> 04:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
not a
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:03.910 --> 04:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
correct and so my question is are there
 
04:18:07.070 --> 04:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
other safety certifications in the date
 
04:18:10.349 --> 04:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
where we don't expect the person to
 
04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:18.030 --> 04:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
digital access for perhaps the
 
04:18:19.950 --> 04:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
department of safety or whoever is
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
involved I I know firsthand as far as
 
04:18:25.830 --> 04:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
driver's license are concerned they do
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
not have that that option uh I can't
 
04:18:32.229 --> 04:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
speak to other snowmobile registrations
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
or safety cards uh or or fishing game
 
04:18:37.149 --> 04:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing licenses what the
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
practice of those departments are I I
 
04:18:42.189 --> 04:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:46.349 --> 04:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
sorry any representative D thank you Mr
 
04:18:48.990 --> 04:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you um for taking my
 
04:18:52.109 --> 04:18:52.119 align:start position:0%
question um does the fiscal note here
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
says that the Department's going to lose
 
04:18:56.790 --> 04:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
about $20,000 a year it looks like
 
04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
there's 3,000 replacement cards $10 each
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
um it costs 10,000 to to print them is
 
04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
that $20,000 going to be
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
impactful uh I must conf confess to you
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
sir that I don't know how they reached
 
04:19:09.960 --> 04:19:11.030 align:start position:0%
sir that I don't know how they reached
that

04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
$20,000 um I know that there is a
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
contract in place so that when people
 
04:19:18.349 --> 04:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
get their cards those revenues that's
 
04:19:19.990 --> 04:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
what those revenues are based
 
04:19:23.149 --> 04:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
upon uh it's my belief that this bill is
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
not any way going to replace or cause
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
those revenues to drop because people
 
04:19:31.469 --> 04:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
are going to get the card uh if if this
 
04:19:33.229 --> 04:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill was to exempt
 
04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
them from getting the card and just
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
providing us with an email saying they
 
04:19:39.910 --> 04:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
pass the the the course we'd be talking
 
04:19:41.149 --> 04:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
about a different story and then I
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
believe those those revenues would be
 
04:19:47.469 --> 04:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
impacted or or a followup thank you Mr
 
04:19:47.479 --> 04:19:49.590 align:start position:0%
impacted or or a followup thank you Mr
chair

04:19:49.590 --> 04:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:19:53.109 --> 04:19:53.119 align:start position:0%
um as we just heard this isn't a license
 
04:19:56.830 --> 04:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
but it is um you know a safety um sort
 
04:19:57.910 --> 04:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
of a safety
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
certificate um one thing that some
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
people worry about when um when you have
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
copies is um fraud or um you know um
 
04:20:10.510 --> 04:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
yeah fraud basically is there any have
 
04:20:12.429 --> 04:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
is there any concern about fraud in cop
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
in copies of these safety
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
certificates uh we we're dealing that
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
with that now so whether it's a a an
 
04:20:21.510 --> 04:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
electronic image or something we're
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with that on a regular basis now
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
um people are are doing their best even
 
04:20:28.910 --> 04:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
with cards swapping them with relative
 
04:20:31.950 --> 04:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
with there's no photo on it um there are
 
04:20:37.149 --> 04:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
ways for us to to to to look at that um
 
04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative wolf I passed around my
 
04:20:41.149 --> 04:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
card he went to put my card in his
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
pocket when I reminded him my physical
 
04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
description was a part of that barcode
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
he quickly handed it
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
over that's just one method by which we
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
can can ensure that and you yeah
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes it all slips with the cracks
 
04:20:59.630 --> 04:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:04.830 --> 04:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
problem I have a suggestion what about
 
04:21:07.269 --> 04:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
tattooing the barcod on your shoulder I
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
mean right on your forehead would be
 
04:21:10.349 --> 04:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
okay that might have to go before a
 
04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
different committee Health and Human
 
04:21:14.319 --> 04:21:15.990 align:start position:0%
different committee Health and Human
Services

04:21:15.990 --> 04:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
Services
 
04:21:21.910 --> 04:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
sorry uh any other questions of the
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%

you Mr chairman thank you Captain for
 
04:21:30.070 --> 04:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question the uh voter safety
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
card is that for everybody on the boat
 
04:21:33.910 --> 04:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
or just for the operator just for the
 
04:21:35.750 --> 04:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
operator and just for the operator of a
 
04:21:38.189 --> 04:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
boat over 2 horsepower currently the
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
statute exempts people who are operating
 
04:21:42.630 --> 04:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
a boat that is less than 25 horsepower
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
from having to have the the card in the
 
04:21:48.189 --> 04:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
course thank you yes sir anything else
 
04:21:51.389 --> 04:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:21:54.149 --> 04:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
question your mic
 
04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
on um I just got a dumb question um when
 
04:22:02.109 --> 04:22:02.119 align:start position:0%
did you start us getting
 
04:22:04.309 --> 04:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
these when did you start putting these
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
out uh the the
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature passed the mandatory
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
requirement for the course in 2000 was
 
04:22:13.990 --> 04:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
effective 2001 so we're we're going into
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
24 25 years now oh okay I think mine
 
04:22:19.109 --> 04:22:19.119 align:start position:0%
says since 2008 maybe I got it
 
04:22:21.550 --> 04:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
later you need a
 
04:22:23.950 --> 04:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
renewal no they promised we'd never have
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
to renew them that was one of the big
 
04:22:30.750 --> 04:22:30.760 align:start position:0%

questions

04:30:54.149 --> 04:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.309 --> 04:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you again for allowing me to speak
 
04:30:57.670 --> 04:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
on the Department of Environmental
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
Services regarding House Bill
 
04:31:03.189 --> 04:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
1554 which affects the certified Calvert
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
maintainer program my name is darling
 
04:31:07.469 --> 04:31:07.479 align:start position:0%
for the current Wetland SP
 
04:31:09.790 --> 04:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
administrator the Culvert maintainer
 
04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
program is a program that allows towns
 
04:31:14.750 --> 04:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
to have one or two individuals within
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
the town precertify by passing a course
 
04:31:19.389 --> 04:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
taught by uh professional development at
 
04:31:23.429 --> 04:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
UNH to replace culverts up to 48 in in
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
diameter if you are a certified Culvert
 
04:31:27.990 --> 04:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
maintainer you may replace these
 
04:31:31.870 --> 04:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
culverts uh in kind or with a certain
 
04:31:34.870 --> 04:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
amount of expansion in diameter up to
 
04:31:37.109 --> 04:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
again that 40 in limit without obtaining
 
04:31:39.109 --> 04:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
a permit in advance this allows town
 
04:31:42.309 --> 04:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
dpws to maintain their assets with less
 
04:31:43.870 --> 04:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork there is a reporting
 
04:31:45.670 --> 04:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
requirement where the covert maintainer
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
does need to provide quarterly reports
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
outlining the covers that they have
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
maintained um many of these guys are in
 
04:31:54.670 --> 04:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
the field they're not somebody who has a
 
04:31:57.309 --> 04:31:57.319 align:start position:0%
desk in town with a laptop or a computer
 
04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
on it which does make it difficult for
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
them to do their online reporting this
 
04:32:03.750 --> 04:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill would provide for another
 
04:32:06.670 --> 04:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
individual in town to file those reports
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
on behalf of their DPW crew so we're
 
04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
hoping that it facilitates compliance
 
04:32:14.670 --> 04:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
with the current reporting uh
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
requirements of this provision in
 
04:32:20.790 --> 04:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
law we support this bill is there any
 
04:32:23.389 --> 04:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
other is there any any any questions
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee
 
04:32:27.750 --> 04:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative hgan thank you Mr
 
04:32:29.070 --> 04:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
question uh the person who fills out the
 
04:32:33.630 --> 04:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
report does it matter who it is does it
 
04:32:37.070 --> 04:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
have to be a public workp
 
04:32:38.910 --> 04:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
technically at the moment whoever is the
 
04:32:40.910 --> 04:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
certified cul maintainer is supposed to
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
be the person who files the report uh
 
04:32:45.510 --> 04:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
this will change that so that it won't
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
matter who files the report as long as
 
04:32:50.109 --> 04:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
report for that maintainer is received
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
so it could be you know if there are
 
04:32:54.590 --> 04:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
three people in town who are certified
 
04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
and they each give their reports to the
 
04:32:58.590 --> 04:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
town clerk the town clerk could enter
 
04:33:00.710 --> 04:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
the reports for all three they just need
 
04:33:04.029 --> 04:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
to give them a list to report on their
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
behalf well followup and the individual
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
who is submitting the report does not
 
04:33:11.470 --> 04:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be a certified
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
individual they're just going to
 
04:33:14.590 --> 04:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
consolidate information fill out of
 
04:33:18.830 --> 04:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
reports and new fill out form correct
 
04:33:18.840 --> 04:33:20.109 align:start position:0%
reports and new fill out form correct
thank

04:33:20.109 --> 04:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:33:23.709 --> 04:33:23.719 align:start position:0%
you representative run thank you Mr
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:33:28.470 --> 04:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
question so I'm assuming by the a
 
04:33:30.150 --> 04:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
comment you just made Miss horse that
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with compliance with
 
04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
people submitting the reports um but um
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
can you explain the value of the reports
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
like why is it important for DS to get
 
04:33:44.269 --> 04:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
them is that who who receives a
 
04:33:47.109 --> 04:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
report why why are the reports necessary
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
so Dees does receive these um by having
 
04:33:53.230 --> 04:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
the quarterly reports it helps us update
 
04:33:56.470 --> 04:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
our own records on what assets are out
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
there it does allow us to make sure we
 
04:34:00.070 --> 04:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
understand that things have been
 
04:34:02.109 --> 04:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
properly replaced with the appropriate
 
04:34:03.750 --> 04:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
size not
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
downsized and if someone asks a question
 
04:34:09.269 --> 04:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
as to if you're in a flood event and
 
04:34:11.349 --> 04:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
something fails we can go back and see
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
what was LE recently replaced it is
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
actually a mechanism that many of these
 
04:34:18.551 --> 04:34:18.561 align:start position:0%
towns use to replace their culverts
 
04:34:20.789 --> 04:34:20.799 align:start position:0%
after flood events uh without an
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization or a permit
 
04:34:24.629 --> 04:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
because if it was less than 48 in you
 
04:34:26.990 --> 04:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
can replace it as a covert
 
04:34:28.910 --> 04:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
maintainer without needing to get a
 
04:34:31.349 --> 04:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
permit so it facilitates that we use the
 
04:34:31.359 --> 04:34:32.830 align:start position:0%
permit so it facilitates that we use the
records

04:34:32.830 --> 04:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
records
 
04:34:35.510 --> 04:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
to um help answer complaints or help
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
track maintenance and help update our
 
04:34:40.429 --> 04:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
own records as well as there's a
 
04:34:42.670 --> 04:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
database known as the sades database
 
04:34:45.310 --> 04:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
which is a shared asset database that we
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
share with
 
04:34:50.510 --> 04:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
Dot and other governmental agencies that
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
for um flood road
 
04:34:53.279 --> 04:34:54.789 align:start position:0%
for um flood road
maintenance

04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
04:34:57.150 --> 04:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
coordination uh this helps
 
04:34:59.910 --> 04:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
us with
 
04:35:02.990 --> 04:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
Vale thank you Mr chair thank you for my
 
04:35:09.990 --> 04:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
question um so I just wanted to reaffirm
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
this is covers that are 48 inches in
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
diameter and greater that are reported
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
on less or less except thank you this is
 
04:35:27.189 --> 04:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:29.629 --> 04:35:29.639 align:start position:0%

you mentioned this is for municipal um
 
04:35:40.470 --> 04:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
employees it seems that there must be
 
04:35:43.310 --> 04:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
other people that have to um repair CTS
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
like do how do those get reported and
 
04:35:48.990 --> 04:35:49.000 align:start position:0%

that um repair culs on their own on
 
04:35:54.390 --> 04:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
their own land do do those get reported
 
04:35:58.910 --> 04:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
