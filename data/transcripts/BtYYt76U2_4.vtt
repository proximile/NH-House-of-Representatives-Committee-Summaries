name is Joshua Hillyard I'm the
 
00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 align:start position:0%
compliance and enforcement council at
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank you for your time
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
particularly the chairman who I know was
 
00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 align:start position:0%
instrumental in getting this bill
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
forward as well as the committee to
 
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
consider it today um just brief
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
background uh the insurance department
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
initially brought this forward um really
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
is a prophylactic measure it's not a
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
concern we've seen happen in New
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but in other states uh but
 
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
we've received a number of comments and
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
the department would really like
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
additional time to considerate so what
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
I'd request today is that uh this bill
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
be marked in expedient to legislate or
 
00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
whatever procedural process is best to
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
allow the department and other
 
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
interested parties additional time to to
 
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.589 align:start position:0%
interested parties additional time to to
consider

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
this good
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
idea happy to take any questions if
 
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
there's any
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from the
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
committee I guess when you say kill it
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
so they're not going to ask anything
 
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
more all right great thank you very much
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else would like to
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
speak on 125
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.029 align:start position:0%
 
guess

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
uh 25 minutes minutes yeah so yeah so
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
yeah okay we'll we'll we will have a
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this bill and discuss
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
why why the story behind it and explain
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
to everybody why we don't
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
really to because
 
00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879 align:start position:0%
normally that we we would do a
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so So when you say let's
 
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
you know explore it but the department
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
really has no great Mo motivation to
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
want to pass this legislation because it
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
affects secondary market and you don't
 
00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
really regulate that anyways right and
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
at this point there's no real drive to
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh there was some some insightful
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
comments that suggested that the the ill
 
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
this bill was uh trying to combat which
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
again is prophylactic in nature we
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
haven't seen this in the state is
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
already um adequately covered with the
 
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
laws that are in place um so given that
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
there there didn't seem to be a great
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
need to to pass this great perfect okay
 
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.909 align:start position:0%
need to to pass this great perfect okay
thank

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
one okay see I was not expecting
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:30:15.870 align:start position:0%

department the analysis this bill
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
clarifies the distinction between
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
personal and Commercial lines in
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%

for auditable basis policies and
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
requires the insurer to State the

specific reason for cancellation or
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
refusal to renew a pro policy this bill

pink card so so we know yes sir thank
 
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
you and welcome aboard good morning my
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
name is James Fox I am the PNC director
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
this is um what we usually like to call
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
our our a bit of a cleanup bill or a
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
modernization bill uh and it has BAS
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
basically if you boil it down it's got
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
three parts um the first part is there
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
is uh in Insurance Land a distinction
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
between commercial insurance and
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
personal lines insurance so if you're a
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
homeowner you have a personal Lin
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
insurance and if you're a business you
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
have a commercial lines and where
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
exactly that line is drawn uh is always
 
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:45.950 align:start position:0%
exactly that line is drawn uh is always
a

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
question um the current standard uh we
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
have is in the Department's opinion more
 
00:32:54.629 --> 00:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
detailed than it needs to be uh we've
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
had uh a couple of insurance companies
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
come in and say they think they should
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
be able to write a particular product on
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
a a personalized basis and not have to
 
00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
do a commercial lines and it was uh we
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
had detailed the law so much that uh I
 
00:33:09.629 --> 00:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
told them that they're not allowed to
 
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to be allowed to do
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
that um after uh internal discussion we
 
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
decided that the best thing to do was to
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
um dial back that a little bit and just
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
make it that it's personal lines uh if
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
it's for um personal use uh is for
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
personal family or household needs so if
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
a policy is being issued by the
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
insurance company now for personal
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
family or household needs then it needs
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
to be on a personal line basis uh and
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
then usually how it works is other than
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
that it would be on a commercialized
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
basis so that's how we'll draw the line
 
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
um the department has historically not
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to get too into um the company's
 
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
uh business on exactly on what they're
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
going to um write on a personal lines
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
basis versus a commercial lines basis
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
there certain things that are clearly
 
00:33:57.549 --> 00:33:57.559 align:start position:0%
must be commercial certain things
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
clearly need to be personal but there's
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
also a gray area and we think it's best
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
for the market to let the companies
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
control that uh so that was the basis
 
00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
for um that change um the next change uh
 
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
is on auditable policies so if you don't
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
know what an audible policy is that's um
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
workers compensation is a classic
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
example that's a situation where the
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
company's basically estimating um the
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
risk UPF front and uh then estimating
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
your premium and then at the end of the
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
policy uh period they commit and they do
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
an audit and they determine then exactly
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
what you um what you should pay for that
 
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
period um the only change in that is
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
that it used to just say you the um
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
insurance company could do it by
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
telephone or mail um that's a bit
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
outdated uh Cons considering virtual
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
means now such as teams and zoom so now
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
we just want to change that to allow um
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
the companies to be able to interact
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
with their uh Insurance uh businesses uh
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
via uh electronic communication like
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
teams and zoom uh and then the last
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
change before the requested Amendment um
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
we made was that we wanted the uh
 
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
insurance companies in uh person Lin's
 
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
property to State the specific reason uh
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
for cancellation um which is pretty
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
consistent with our rules in most
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
instances uh but in the old version it
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
said um there was a more complicated uh
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
process for the insured to be able to
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
get the reason why um the cancellation
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
was being issued um cancellations are
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
pretty Limited in the state of New
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh so we thought it would be
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
um better and more consumer friendly if
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
we just state that the insurance company
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
must State the basis for the
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
cancellation they do it in commercial
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
lines now this is in personal lines uh
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
so that we don't think that should be a
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
problem uh the last the last change
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
we're requesting is that in our adjuster
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
law we have this is a requested
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
amendment of our um uh in our commercial
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
in our adjusters law so we we license
 
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
adjusters so we have a claim um the
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
person who comes out and investigates
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
the claim that's the adjuster uh in uh
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
we have noticed that for solely glass
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
claims and that means your automobile
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
claim um that is a very uh simple
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
process that's generally been automated
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
now uh doesn't really require a human uh
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
at all and not a licensed human if you
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
if your windshield is cracked you you
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
are entitled to either a fix or a new
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
one if you have auto autog glass
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
coverage uh and if there's any problem
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
with that uh they'll the they will know
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
to contact the department because then
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
that would be a statement by the
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
insurance company uh that like the claim
 
00:36:40.309 --> 00:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
is being denied so we don't feel that
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
that um almost ministerial task uh to
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
just swap out a piece of glass as
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to say there's a damage to the
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
car and the Damage actually to the
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle needs to be invest you know
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
investigated like well there's frame
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
damage there's all different kinds of
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
damage that are possible so it's such a
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
simp Le uh damage if it's solely a class
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
claim we'd like it to be that they don't
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
need to have an adjuster and um we have
 
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
noticed that the companies most of them
 
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
are wanting that change and we don't
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
think it in any way uh compromises the
 
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
consumer's uh protection so those are
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
are the kind of uh I'd call them mostly
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
modernization and cleanup and a little
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
bit of further commun uh consumer
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
protection in the context of a
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
cancellation that the uh Department uh
 
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
requests and I'm happy to take any
 
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.829 align:start position:0%
requests and I'm happy to take any
question

00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative Gibbs has
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
a question thank you uh and thank you
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
for coming today uh can you tell us the
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
reason that um uh a couple of things
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
were deleted from the definition of
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
personal risk um specifically owner
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
occupied one to four family buildings
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
and mobile homes uh were deleted um sure
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
I can I can tell you that the the owner
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
occupied was actually the the driver
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
driving force uh for the change that we
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
had we had a so the over had to be
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
unoccupied in less than four units I
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
believe the old the we had a situation
 
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
where someone uh was just running out
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
their condo they owned a condo they were
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
just running out the condo and the
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
insurance company and that is actually
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
how it generally does work um wanted to
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
write that on a personal lined basis and
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
we said well it's not owner occupied so
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
you can't and that seemed uh internally
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
at the insurance department to be
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with how we thought it
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
should operate so that's why we wanted
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
to uh change to be uh not be owner
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
occupied and just be a decision based
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
upon um more of a holistic view of
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
what's Happening um so that the owner
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
occupied was actually the the the
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
primary problem and that's why we get
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
rid of that um and
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
the uh mobile homes uh you know that um
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
that I think that that was an issue with
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
just the language and the issue of uh
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
like a recreational vehicle uh and um we
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
didn't think it was necessary to have
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
that in there separate that if it's so
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
that would be covered still but it would
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
be covered uh in the sense of whether
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's just for family uh personal family
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
or household needs that we didn't need
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
to single out uh mobile homes in the
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
list this is for all personal risks like
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
we can list tons of different personal
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
risks and we didn't think that mobile
 
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
homes needed to be in there homeowners
 
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
is the the the the main uh one version
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then the other automobile but we
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
didn't feel that you needed to have a
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
mobile home on the list it was just like
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary representative
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
B thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
you were talking about glass claims
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
they're pretty simple but they really
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
aren't sometimes because of the
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
electronics that are embedded in the
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
glass would you need an a uh an agent to
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
come and look at that to assess the
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
damage or how are they dealing with that
 
00:39:58.309 --> 00:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
now no so um so you you're
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
you're the the you you get your car uh
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
back to pre-loss condition so pre-loss
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
condition in that case the insurance
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
companies knowe would be whatever type
 
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
of uh windshield you had so if you have
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh like my car I have an old car so it's
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
just a regular piece of glass you throw
 
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
in uh but in that case a high-tech
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
window then the insurance company knows
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
that they need to have a high-tech
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
window and that um would not need
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
adjustment adjust adjusters are more
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
like to look at the exact and like write
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
quotes and like this but in that case
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's very clear if you have a a win
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
thing where where if it rains or wind
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
your wipers turn on or something like
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
that then that is that is the the type
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
of glass you get um the only other ISS
 
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
issue is whether it's uh original
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
equipment manufacturer or aftermarket
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
parts but that's not that doesn't that
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't involve that this issue either
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
so you would still get that and all the
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
insurance companies know that that
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a concern you don't you
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need an adjuster for that
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
represent of
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
taon just just to be clear I've had I
 
00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:57.079 align:start position:0%
have an auditable po workman's comp
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
policy which I complete electronically
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
now with my carrier I've had glass
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
claims with a fancy electronic
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
windshields which are basically carried
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
out between the glass shop and the the
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
carrier again is this not permissible
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
under current law you you you you you
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
hit the nail on the head on that one
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
that that that that is the issue so um
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
how the industry is going is that the uh
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh insurance companies have U made deals
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
with uh glass companies and if you call
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
in for just a glass claim uh that shifts
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
you over I won't name the name of the
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
company but there's one particular safe
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
light I will name it so uh that shifts
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
you to Safe Light they they do the whole
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
process uh and that we have not uh We've
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
so we've done exams on this we have not
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
found a problem with safe light they are
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
seem to be a good company we have not
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
found uh problems with glass claims the
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
only problem we found is that they don't
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
have adjusters license bues and then we
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
the require the uh insurance company at
 
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
this point to to have an adjuster um
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
assigned to each glass claim and then
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
the issue then came up why are you
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
requiring us to do this and then the
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
issue well the law says we have to do
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
that uh but we understand that this the
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
Simplicity of a glass claim um wouldn't
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
need that change but we said we need to
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
go to legislature to ask you know we're
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
in the enforcement Branch so we need to
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
go to legisl to ask them um to alter the
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
law uh which we've done before on uh
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
this is not the first time we've been
 
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
here on the adjusters first notice of
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
loss was another issue they technically
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
under the law they needed to have an
 
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
adjuster's license to do a first notice
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
of loss when you call the insurance
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
company um uh and we changed that a few
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
years ago to say that the first notice
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
of loss is uh is more of a clerical act
 
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
so you don't need that so we're kind of
 
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
trying to be um balance the you know the
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
the needs of Industry you don't want to
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
uh burden them too much because then
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
that's when your rates go up uh so we
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
want to burden them when there's a
 
00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
consumer protection need to do it and uh
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
with glass uh our position at this point
 
00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:03.079 align:start position:0%
is that there isn't now obviously if it
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem later then we would sh
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
we'll be back here explaining that you
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
know I I I will say which I've done
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
before I've made a mistake uh but I
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
think I think we're right on this we've
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
looked at it pretty extensively further
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
question me inquire so and essentially
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing with the workers
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
comp I mean my workers I just send them
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
I email them the 941s and that's
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
basically the end of the conversation
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
yeah usually it's pretty simple but you
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
know this was just our actuary um
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
thought that we should change the
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
language of the law because it just says
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
phone and mail to make it phone mail and
 
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.079 align:start position:0%
on like you know um a
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
virtual yeah uh that you could already
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
do but this is more for the audit in
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
terms of uh in terms of interacting like
 
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
the the so you could have in person so
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
that would be one version then um and
 
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
then you'd have uh you know the um
 
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
electronic version which would already
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
be uh maybe you could arue arue mail is
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
email but this would basically make it
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
clear that the insurance company and the
 
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
insured can do it all electronically
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
everything that needs to be
 
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
done representative
 
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
for bringing this legislation um in a
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
previous life I used to repair
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
windshields a long time ago um and the
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
way it worked in a this was a different
 
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
state um the if if a consumer got a chip
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
that the insurance company would just
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
send us out to repair the ship they
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
would wave the deductible uh because it
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
saved them from replacing the entire
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
windshield um and it seemed to work uh
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
just fine so this amendment would cover
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
that scenario correct yeah that would
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
that would be a Pure Glass claim it
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.589 --> 00:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
it representative pelli on the
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
cancellation can you thank you for
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question on the cancellation I
 
00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:53.079 align:start position:0%
was hoping that maybe you could repeat
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
why the language in the bill was struck
 
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh because uh so we have um Auto and we
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
have uh commercial and we have personal
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
lines three cancellation statutes and uh
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
in uh the only one that doesn't have the
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
states of specific reason which is what
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
we usually do uh in a lot of context
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
like if there's going to be a denial uh
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
is the personalized one so that's like
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
the the homeowner uh it didn't have it
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
didn't just straight say to tell them
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
the reason why um you're canceling them
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
and the insurance company will know the
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
reason because there only there are very
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
few reasons you can cancel so the the
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
what we used to be in there is that
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
you'd have to go through this process
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
the the consumer would need to go
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
through this process to get the answer
 
00:45:40.109 --> 00:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
so we we didn't think it was um uh a
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
significant burden on the insurance
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
company just in the first instance to
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
tell in the cancellation notice why it
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
was being cancelled as opposed to a
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
process like if you contact us in
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
writing request U that so it's just uh
 
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
it's just a pro consumer change great
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
you um so actually
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
um a couple of these are actually are
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
strike home the home for me uh today or
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
this week um and it would be a employers
 
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:14.559 align:start position:0%
uh commercial but I had uh a deer attack
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
the side of a one of my employees trucks
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
and uh and of course the the insurance
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
company think it was only Liberty
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
mutuals only thought it was going to be
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
$2,600 and and we haven't got any quotes
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
less than 6,000 for it but uh that's a
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
commercial but everything is done online
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
now I mean none of these are these
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
agents or adjusters are not New
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based they're even though
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
Liberty Mutual does have business here
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
but I I don't know if they the only
 
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
requirement they have to be uh licensed
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but we they can be
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
based a lot of different places but they
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
need to be licensed here so that license
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
must be fairly inexpensive right they
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
are uh I don't know exact number but
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
they are that is one of when uh so when
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
when companies so no matter where the
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
company is if the ACT if if the accident
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
involves a New Hampshire insured we say
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
that they have to have a a New Hampshire
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
license uh because they're adjusting
 
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
with all of our rules and then they say
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
Well we'd have to pay for that and then
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
I know uh um the answer usually is it's
 
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
very inexpensive to do that so and if
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
you have an adjustor who's already
 
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:16.839 align:start position:0%
licensed in another state it's very easy
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
to get a New Hampshire license but it's
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
for the fundamental purpose that if
 
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
there was a Consumer complaint that you
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
have uh reason to uh talk to the company
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
and this adjuster and say you sure you
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
want to take that stance otherwise we
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
might pull your license correct yeah
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
John hun another lever on the yeah
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
adjusters like to protect their licenses
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh section one um ironically where
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
this strikes to home for me a little bit
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
is that my home is a vacation
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
rental and some people think that's a
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
commercial application now so far the
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
courts have pretty much held up that is
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
a residential and I guess I would guess
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
have you had any problems with vacation
 
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
rentals when it comes to is the property
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
the properly insured and with the
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
insurer pay for it's insured that that
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
is that is everybody seems to come the
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
reason we're doing these things that
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
that is the reason the primary driver
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
behind this though is that some when you
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
said some people think this some people
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
think that um we didn't feel that the
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
insurance department should should in in
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
require um the insurance every insurance
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
company to to view
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh specific fact patterns one way
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
because the in very detail because uh
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
and that may sound nice uh in a certain
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
context in a vacuum but the problem is
 
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
when you um tell a company exactly you
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
must do it this way in very detailed and
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
that means every time it falls outside
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
that detail then they don't do it that
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
way even though you no I meant you I no
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
that one you should do that way too so
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's it the Department's experience um
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
and this really started in Auto uh when
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
we when we did the as most people
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
probably know we have a take all Comer
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
state so insurance companies you have to
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
sell to everybody and one of the things
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to put we did a bulletin
 
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to put in the bulletin we're
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
going to explain the the exact line
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
between personal lines and Commercial
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
lines and that became um quite a
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
discussion and quite a a disagreement
 
00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
and then it got to the point where they
 
00:49:23.309 --> 00:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
this this should not be in a bulletin
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
and the department should not be taking
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
a strong stance we should have The
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
Stance of the insurance companies should
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
operate their businesses and if it's my
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
the word I use if it passes a straight
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
face test that then it's that's fine uh
 
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
if if a a particular insured doesn't
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't think it should be uh um for
 
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
example if they say this a commercial
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going to view it as a as a a
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
personal in this particular fact pattern
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
then you know the the Department's uh
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
always position in a lot of areas is
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
then you should shop your insurance we
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
have competitive market we have a lot of
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
different insurance companies you can go
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
to so sh shop shop your your business as
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to locking the insurance
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
companies in and then having unattended
 
00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:04.799 align:start position:0%
consequences which are significantly
 
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
worse for the consumer so uh that means
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
that it's really up to the insurance
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
company whether they want to treat it as
 
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
a personal residence or a commercial
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
residence as long as for for as a
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
straight face we could say it falls
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
within personal family or household
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
needs that is the the last sentence is
 
00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:21.559 align:start position:0%
going to control everything before that
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it's really
 
00:50:25.549 --> 00:50:25.559 align:start position:0%
their decision what they want to cover
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to they have it's the
 
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
obligations on them to make that
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
determination right and then we do
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
Market conduct and if we we went in on a
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
market conduct basis and we said this
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
company is not listening not following
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
the the the three three rules of
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
personal family or household needs then
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
we would say you got to stop that you
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
got to change direction so that's how we
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
handle that so it's a one of our units
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
goes into insurance companies and tests
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
these things perfect thank you thank you
 
00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.359 align:start position:0%

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%

representing the towns of Canterbury and
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
Lowden I speak to you today on this
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
organ donor Rights bill as someone who
 
01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:51.559 align:start position:0%
received a life saving kidney transplant
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
just four years ago so I am very
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
familiar with with all aspects of the
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
organ donation and Transplant
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
process HB 1155 the living donor
 
01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.630 align:start position:0%
process HB 1155 the living donor
protection

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
act is a common sense bipartisan bill as
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
its name implies this law would simply
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
protect any living organ donor from
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
losing or being able to obtain life
 
01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:17.559 align:start position:0%
insurance and all would also protect
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
them from discriminatory premium hikes
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
on the sole basis of their having
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
donated uh an organ to somebody
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
what I have found is that insurance
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
companies have a wide range of policies
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
both written and Unwritten when it comes
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
to this subject matter and those that do
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
not discriminate
 
01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
now could do so in the future
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
discrimination against living organ
 
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
donors has can and could continue to
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
occur without this
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
law the reality is that organ donors
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
have to be in Superior Health in order
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
to be a donor in the first place they go
 
01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
through a a very rigorous health
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
screening before they allow before they
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
are allowed to donate some insurance
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
companies then punish them calling their
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
organ donation a preexisting condition
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
in practice they should be giving the
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
organ donors discounts on their
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
insurance given that they have been
 
01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
proven to be in excellent health and the
 
01:02:15.269 --> 01:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
fact that they just saved another
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
person's life thus saving the company
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
from paying out death insurance for that
 
01:02:23.549 --> 01:02:23.559 align:start position:0%
individual this law is not asking for
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
favorable or special treatment for
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
living organ
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
donors it is just asking for equal
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
treatment and protection against
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
penalties you can see that this bill has
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
been co-sponsored by leadership in both
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%

01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
who are waiting for a kidney the wait

for a kidney transplant from a deceased
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
donor can last years and 13 people die
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
every day waiting for a kidney this is
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
where living donors come in they save
 
01:04:27.789 --> 01:04:27.799 align:start position:0%
lives with the selfless Act of donating
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
a kidney and we need to do everything we
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
can to protect them and make more living
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
donation possible when someone donates a
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
kidney to a relative a friend or a
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
stranger they shorten the transplant
 
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
waiting list for everyone else in
 
01:04:41.269 --> 01:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
addition kidneys from living D living
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
organ donors generally last longer than
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
kidneys from deceased donors nearly
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
7,000 living donor kidney transplants
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
were performed last year including 14
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire kidneys are the
 
01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
most common organ transplanted from
 
01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
living donors followed by liver and Lung
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
in addition to transforming the lives of
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
kidney patients organ transplant can
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
have a significant economic impact if a
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
person of working age gets a kidney
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
transplant they are often able to return
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
to a normal life without dialysis and
 
01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:08.839 align:start position:0%
resume working as most dialysis patients
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
are not able to work the cost of a
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
transplant is lower than long-term
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
kidney dialysis HB 1155 helps to
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
encourage becoming a living organ donor
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire by removing a potential
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
hurdle by prohibiting that
 
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination we talked about insurance
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
insurers in 18 states in Washington DC
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
where there is no prohibition against
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination can deny coverage raise
 
01:05:30.269 --> 01:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
existing donor premiums or resend
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
existing life insurance coverage after
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
organ donation is disclosed this problem
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
is widespread but underreported in 2014
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
the American Journal of transplantation
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
wrote among 186 donors who changed or
 
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
initiated life insurance after donation
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
46 or 25% of them reported difficulty
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
among those who reported difficulty 23
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
were denied altogether 27 were charged a
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
higher premium and 177 were told they
 
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
have a pre-existing condition because
 
01:05:57.069 --> 01:05:57.079 align:start position:0%

insurance these practices by insurers
 
01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
create unnecessary burden and stress for
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
those choosing to donate and could

kidney donation among those

considering this discrimination need not

be Universal among insurance companies

donation people who are considering
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
becoming a donor may receive a new quote
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
or an impression from their existing
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
life insurer that rates may increase and
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
they will walk away or can walk away
 
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
from the process leaving that person
 
01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
with organ failure to search for another
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
match Nicole a nurse practitioner living
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire who I spoke to
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday lost her mother last April
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
from anage penal disease she waited six
 
01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
years for a matching organ donor while
 
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
she was on dialysis but none came this
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
bill has passed in 32 states is
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan and noncontroversial the
 
01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
National Council of insurance
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
legislators has authored consensus model
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that this bill is based on
 
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
the American Council of life insurers
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
has supports this particular Bill and
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
federal legislation that is looking to
 
01:06:59.470 --> 01:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
address the same issue we believe that
 
01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
removing Financial burdens for living
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
donors can lead to an increase in organ
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
donations for these reasons we're
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
hopeful for your support of this
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that can improve the lives
 
01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
of those fighting organ failure thank
 
01:07:10.829 --> 01:07:10.839 align:start position:0%
you again uh for your consideration of
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
this critical issue for all those
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
reasons we respectfully as ask that you
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
do report this bill I look forward to
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
answering any questions that you might
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
have representative Terry thank you uh
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious as to how
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
nious the life insurance companies or
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
the companies that offer life insurance
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
and long-term care are with respect to
 
01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
existing policy holders um are there
 
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
Provisions written into LTC policies and
 
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
life insurance policies that if you
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
happen to be an organ donor you can be
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
cancelled if you if you donate an organ
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
During the period of time which you are
 
01:07:48.559 --> 01:07:49.309 align:start position:0%
During the period of time which you are
are

01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
covered uh so I I'm thinking personally
 
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
right now because that's where I begin
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
in so I have a life insurance policy I
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
have a long-term care policy if if I
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
were to donate a
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
kidney I'm first of all I'm wondering
 
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
how the life insurance company or the
 
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
LTC company is going to find out that I
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
did that but let's just say that they
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
did would they be able to cancel because
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere in my policies there's a
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
provision that they can do that or are
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
they cancelling under some broader
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
non-specific term thank you typically
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
that study that I mentioned in the in in
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
my testimony mentioned that it's treated
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
as a pre-existing condition for for new
 
01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
people for new people that's your point
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh and it's only disclosed people tend
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
to disclose those things on an annual
 
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
basis if they're if they're considering
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
doing it less so after the fact to your
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
point uh so they are terminating
 
01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh based I think on a there's
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
not there's not a specific written
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
component in their insurance where
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
they're able to do it it's your point
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not something that's
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
written down in policy follow up please
 
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
for the question do you do do do you
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
have any you cited a bunch of Statistics
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
do you have any uh
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
statistics that indicate the uh the
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
scope of the problem with respect to
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
existing policy holders being cancelled
 
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:10.759 align:start position:0%
because the company finds out that the
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
insured has donated in Oregon do do you
 
01:09:15.789 --> 01:09:15.799 align:start position:0%
have any data on that I don't I because
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
you got 32 states that have done this
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
just wondering somebody must have asked
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
this question I can't imagine I'm the
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
first you're not the challenge is
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
typically with those who have yet to get
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
can get coverage that's why I spoke
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
about the ones addressed those are the
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
ones we are most reaching out for
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
because those are people that are
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
proactively searching or asking the
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
question there are some that are having
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
their coverage terminated but it's a
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
much smaller problem based on I think
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
what I said in the testimony was in that
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
study uh of the 186 the 45 the 25% that
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
reported difficulty uh 27 were charged a
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
higher premium but none none in this
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
particular study were terminated from
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
existing coverage it was just the
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
perspective future donors great thank
 
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.430 align:start position:0%
perspective future donors great thank
you

01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
okay represent Mader um thank you very
 
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman I I just want to
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
clarify this I I actually was life
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
insurance licensed way back when and the
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
only thing we had back then was like a
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
two-year incontestability Clause so
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
nothing like this would have happened
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
how how but you're telling me if if I
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
get this straight that policies that are
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
written now actually include this in
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
other words if uh if it's three years
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
you become a donor we can cancel you or
 
01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
or or raise your premium is that correct
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening for the for this
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
population in this study and and how
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
long has that been going on these bills
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
new I would think these bills have been
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh in play since I think 2016 2017 when
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
this started to become addressed the
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
federal bill was introduced for the
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
first time three congresses ago uh this
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
is uh the reason why so I mentioned en
 
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
coil so the National Council of
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
insurance legislators took this up
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
because they were brought this the same
 
01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
study that I'm mentioning about this 25%
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
this large I mean that's a large number
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
of potential buyers who are being
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
dissuaded from becoming living organ
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
doners that's why they supported the
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
bill that's why they wrote model
 
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
language because they were realizing
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
that this is a growing problem one
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's new because I think also uh more
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
attention is being paid to live organ
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
donation now uh than previously I think
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
maybe when you were covering that was
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
not as pervasive of a and and we like
 
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're happy about that right we're
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
glad that it's becoming more commonplace
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
but I think that's been the the increase
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
in number of ations is leading to the
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
increase in number of people who are
 
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:33.070 align:start position:0%
 
scrutinized

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
spear thank you so I know that the
 
01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
prognosis for uh a person receiving a
 
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
kidney transplant is very good and they
 
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
go on to live pretty pretty good lives
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
like the rest of us uh how about the
 
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
donors do they have any kind of let's
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
you have some numbers on how well they
 
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
do sure yeah I think that's a great
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
question I think the reason the reason
 
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
underpinning the this entire Bill and
 
01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
why discrimination is inappropriate is
 
01:11:57.790 --> 01:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
that there's no additional actual oil
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
risk for someone who's given a kidney uh
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
if they if they've gone through the
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
process where they have been tested they
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
are deemed healthy they're able to give
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
this kidney they're going to have just
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
as long and positive of a life that they
 
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
would have had beforehand kidney is the
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
only organ that you have essentially a
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
spare of your numbers are the same
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
before and after you donate as far as
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
your blood work goes uh so those people
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
who are able to donate are already as as
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously by the bill sponsor
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
they're already have indicated a high
 
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
level of Health that they they are they
 
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
are super fit uh to to continue doing
 
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
this so they're able to run marathons
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
after the fact they're able to have the
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
same healthy life that they had
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
beforehand except for now another person
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh has had their life dramatically
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
extended by by that organ donation I I
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
got to I got to cut in here
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
um most of our insurance regul and I
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
assumed it was all but I do know life
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
insurance is a a whole different animal
 
01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
but because you can
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
be be tested for pre-existing condition
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
I conditions in you but generally you
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
can't um rate someone on something that
 
01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have evidence that that is is
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
statistically correct so does life
 
01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
insurance exempt from that've requ sorry
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
they've been using from the from the
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
Judgment of from the Judgment of those
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
two groups those National groups they've
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
been using data that is not supported by
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
other signs so they're able because
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
there's no regulation on this particular
 
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
finding they're able to use either their
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
own proprietary information
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
non-medically accepted data that says
 
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
that life outcomes are different for
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
donors or that actual risk is higher for
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
for people so they found some some
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
something to offer it up to defend their
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
using this as a that's understanding as
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
a rating
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
Factor okay but enco so enco rejected
 
01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:42.830 align:start position:0%
Factor okay but enco so enco rejected
that

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
their that finding correct they they
 
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
they looked at the the same scientific
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
data they had legislators present and
 
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
they said that we you know from our
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
understanding and all the data we've
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
been presented there is no additional
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
actual risk so we believe that a
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
legislation at the federal level which
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
sets a floor for an understanding for
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
all insurance providers is necessary and
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
in lie of that we passed it in 32 states
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
try that that brings up a whole another
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
can of worson to think of how of what
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
else is going on in the ins in life
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
insurance Market where these actuarials
 
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
are are cooking up the numbers I can't
 
01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:17.270 align:start position:0%
speak to that
[Laughter]

01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately okay representat Terry
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
again um so I can Envision how this
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
could happen with a situation where
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
somebody is applying for life insurance
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
or long-term care and they disclose the
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
person discloses I I was a an organ
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
donor okay um I'm I'm fully in support
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill but so I I can understand
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
how how that could happen and we want to
 
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
deal with that in this bill will you do
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to understand a is is
 
01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
that a life insurance policy a long-term
 
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
care policy is is effectively a contract
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
what language in these
 
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
contracts is being appealed to or
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
utilized I should say is being utilized
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
as a basis for discontinuing coverage to
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
a policy holder who's become an organ
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
donor during the time in which the
 
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
person is a policy holder sure what what
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
provision are they
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
utilizing do this i' like where what is
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
the language and where is it speak I'd
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
like to sort of consult with my with my
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
co-workers to try to figure what that is
 
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
I think it varies by state what
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
particular Clause is being either
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
violated or or being appealed to and so
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
if I'd like to provide that subsequently
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
to this hearing I'd like to do that
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
would you get that I'm really curious I
 
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
would venture to say that most people
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
this occurs when they renew their
 
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
driver's license representative Gibs
 
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh there's no additional
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
Actuarial risk for uh living kidney
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
donors do you have similar information
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
for donors of other types of organs for
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
liver and for I don't I don't have it
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
with me as well but I I I can I can only
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
speak to kidneys I know that the
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
recovery process for liver donation is a
 
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
lot longer than that of kidney I think
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's two to three times longer but I
 
01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
believe the same uh just as just as
 
01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
kidneys uh donors have to go through a a
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
very rigorous screening and matching
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
process I believe that the outcomes are
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
similar to kidney but I can speak only
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
with with sever like high levels of
 
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
confidence about
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
grassy my question is sort of on the
 
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
line of Representative Terry's questions
 
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
is and the concern I have are you seeing
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
this in in mainstream insurance carriers
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
or is this something that's coming up
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
with just some of these Fly by Night
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
insurance they give you a really really
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
low rates but really really crappy
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
coverage I think that's a great question
 
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
I think we have seen the larger National
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
organizations support this legislation
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
likely because they are not themselves
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
part of this discrimination so it's a
 
01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
it's really I think you know uh I know
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
all state is generally supportive of
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
legislation uh in this space there are
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
some other larger groups that have
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
indicated not being in opposition to
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
them so I think I think to your point I
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
think that there is a a likely chance
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
that there are some of the minor players
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
who are operating in in a this is this
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
is a non-regulated not life insurance is
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
not a non-regulated space but this
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
particular element of of risk assessment
 
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
and and and actual roal risk assessment
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
is is Curr further question so what
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that most of the
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
mainstream uh insurance carriers support
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
this legislation right and then and then
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
the council the organization that that
 
01:17:41.709 --> 01:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
they are part
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
of Representative piselli oh thank you
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this is an issue
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we were not aware of However
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I have family experience
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
with bone marrow transplant which is not
 
01:17:59.229 --> 01:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
technically an organ I guess so would
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
that type of um issue be covered under
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
this bill we have not heard of a lot of
 
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination for bone marrow uh donors
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
in this in this in this way we we tend
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
to work uh when we do other legislation
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
that addresses uh unpaid and paid leave
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
we do a lot more with that particular
 
01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
Community um but as far as we have not
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
heard about them being subject to the
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
same levels of discrimination from uh
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be we just we just
 
01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
they're not thank
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
you represent believe thank you for
 
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's not about
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
insurance but it's about uh donors um if
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
a young person um dies in a car accident
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
and he doesn't have it listed on his
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
card that he would be a donor could the
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
parents decide that um he was going to
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
be a donor do you know that I don't for
 
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm not sure if there's
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
this particular regul about that in the
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
state but I can't speak to that thanks
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much I have one more

my daughter is the assistant
 
01:19:37.229 --> 01:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
communication director for the American

John in their office in Washington and
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
um her grandmother my mother passed away
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
from kidney failure and she brought this
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill to my attention
 
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to just share with you our
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
family's experience um following heart
 
01:20:01.629 --> 01:20:01.639 align:start position:0%
surgery my mother had complications
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
resulting in the failure of both of her
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
kidneys uh putting her on twice a week
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
dialysis she was too old for a
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
transplant but she had but had she been
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
eligible she would have jumped at the
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
chance she was always an active
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
person uh and being tied to a dialysis
 
01:20:25.229 --> 01:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
machine uh just wasn't her thing so she
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
made the courageous decision to end
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
those treatments and that is what uh
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
eventually killed
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
her I saw what kidney damage can do to a
 
01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
loved one and as legislators we should
 
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
do whatever we can to ensure that anyone
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
any that any that as many people as
 
01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
possible who wish to be potential donors
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to do so so that
 
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
those people in need of an organ can
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
benefit from it if this bill um if this
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
bill ensures that one living donor is
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
able to help one person like my mother
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
continue to live a long and fruitful
 
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
life then it is worth it and with that I
 
01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:13.719 align:start position:0%
hope that you will recommend this as
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass I'm happy to take any
 
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
questions but I know that chairman hunt
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
wants me to move on
 
01:21:21.639 --> 01:21:24.390 align:start position:0%
wants me to move on

what uh language that an insurance
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%

01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
the House Commerce Committee
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative Joe Sweeney uh
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
representing the town of Salem
 
01:28:08.669 --> 01:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 25 here to introduce my bill
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1507 and act relative to
 
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:13.639 align:start position:0%
Innovative Financial Services I have
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
given you all a copy of my testimony so
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not just going to do the classic
 
01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:19.719 align:start position:0%
read off of the letter um as I'm aware
 
01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
you all can can read it for yourself but
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposing a Sandbox for
 
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
financial tech services within the state
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire what that what that
 
01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
means is when it comes to regulatory
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
sandboxes it will allow Uh current
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
players in the financial services
 
01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
industry as well as outside uh groups
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
that are looking to come into New
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to offer Financial Services uh
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
to be set up in a regulatory sandbox
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
that can examine some of the regulations
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
that we place on Financial Services uh
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
and and relax those regulations within
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
the sandbox while still making making
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
sure that consumers are protected and
 
01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
that the state's interests are protected
 
01:28:58.750 --> 01:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh just to see kind of as a a a real
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
world example of some regulations that
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
we've had on the books for years that
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
might not still be serving uh the same
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
way that they were intended to be
 
01:29:08.669 --> 01:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
serving the state when they were put in
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
place uh in regard just to financial
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
services um I think we're seeing a lot
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure your committee has dealt a
 
01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
lot uh with blockchain technology and
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
new emerging Technologies when it comes
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
to financial services and this will just
 
01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
kind of provide a vehicle
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh for a regulatory sandbox to exist
 
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire for financial Tech
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
um some other states have gone forward
 
01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
with such sandboxes that they've
 
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
implemented um in the financial Tech
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
sector and other sectors as well um and
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's just a it's an opportunity
 
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
for us to allow for the market and for
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
the for financial services to uh create
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
some new products and bring some new
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
products to Consumers here in New
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm happy to take any
 
01:29:50.109 --> 01:29:50.119 align:start position:0%
questions I know I have some others in
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
support here as well and all the hands
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
all the hands let's go so we start in
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
one and representative San thank you uh
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
can you just kind of give you said
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
there's other states that have this can
 
01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
you give me some examples like
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
illustrate so I can like really sure
 
01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
it's been recent but I believe Arizona
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
went through with a a financial regul uh
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
sandbox um in recent years so there
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't been but what does it look like
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
in practice is what I'm asking so it's
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's essentially a relaxed regulatory
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
framework work for the industry in
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
question so it's not it's it's not
 
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
always Financial Tech when when states
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
are looking at sandboxes it's just an
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
ability for um for for Industries to
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
play in the sandbox s to speak and relax
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh but all all has to be
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
approved under this bill all Provisions
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
all all products still have to be
 
01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
approved by the banking Department um so
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's not like they get it's not wild
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
wild west free reain there's still still
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
guidance there and followup for the
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
question may inquire so
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm struggling to understand the the
 
01:30:58.270 --> 01:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
point I mean listen I like the idea of
 
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
reduced regulations if you if you think
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's a regul regulatory problem um it
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
sounds like this is sort of like we're
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
creating maybe a loophole versus just
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
fixing a current regulatory problem or
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
like what what is the problem you're
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
trying to solve so I wouldn't call it
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
creating I I wouldn't consider it
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
creating a loophole I think it's just
 
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
giving an opportunity to test some new
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
products out in New Hampshire that
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise under current regulations
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed and I will say there
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
there are others here to speak on this
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
bill that are a little more
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable than I am exactly on it
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
all right okay represent
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
spear thank you
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh I we've seen a lot of products uh
 
01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:41.719 align:start position:0%
banking type products or monetary
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
products come through this
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
committee based on what I'm reading here
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm not an expert on exactly what
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
this says but I could see a bank setting
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
up a
 
01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and I can see that if
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have to F we don't have any
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
structure for that we have no legal
 
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
structure for such a thing as that uh so
 
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
that would be like a freewheeling thing
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
that would absolutely I don't see where
 
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
there's any protection for the consumer
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
or for the state for that matter so they
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
still have to follow all laws on the
 
01:32:17.229 --> 01:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
books and they have to be permitted by
 
01:32:19.109 --> 01:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
the banking Department to operate in
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
this sandbox it just allows the the
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
Pro product producer the financial
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
institution that's producing the product
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
and the banking Department to work out
 
01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
and the banking Department to work out
the

01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
details themselves without having to to
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
rewrite statute follow follow question
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
forther question me inquire give me an
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
example of such a
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
product the the the purpose of a Sandbox
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
isn't to have a product in mind for I
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have an example for you
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's to allow the market to
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
thrive I don't have I can't point to you
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
a specific example of what will come to
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or what will be created in
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because of this bill this
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
is just us allowing so anything to to
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
come to
 
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
fruition okay representative M um thank
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
you very much um this seems to me a
 
01:33:09.109 --> 01:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
little bit like putting the cart before
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
the horse um I was in the Securities
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
business for I don't know 40 years and I
 
01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
don't see how you can you can come up
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
with a product before you get nasd or
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
sec approval on this and you're not
 
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
talking about that um to me I see a uh a
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
potential uh Ponzi scheme here I I think
 
01:33:33.109 --> 01:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
this this is an industry that that
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
should be very very regulated and this
 
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
appears to be going in the different
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
direction and I think that uh you know
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
consumers are not going to be protected
 
01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
comments moving right
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
along yes uh so uh I believe you've
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
answered my qu you've responded to to my
 
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
question um I think others have asked
 
01:34:00.189 --> 01:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
the question can you give an example of
 
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh of who what and and why not only how
 
01:34:06.669 --> 01:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
it's working but who what and why do you
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
believe that there are are others behind
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
you who will be able to answer that
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
question because if in fact we have this
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
legislation enacted into law in other
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
states then
 
01:34:19.629 --> 01:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
presumably the legislation is being
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
utilized and so we would have who's
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
what's and wise so you believe somebody
 
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
else be able to help with that thank you
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
thanks okay representative Gibbs before
 
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
I move over to other thank you um when I
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
read the bill uh and by the way first of
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
all let me say I find this a very
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
interesting idea but it's not one that
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm previously familiar with um when I
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
read the bill I couldn't find anything
 
01:34:51.149 --> 01:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
that specified how long the test would
 
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
be whether there was any limit on the
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
length or any minimum length um can you
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
give us some information on that that
 
01:35:00.669 --> 01:35:00.679 align:start position:0%
that would be up to the provider of the
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
financial service that's in the sandbox
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
for the length of of it and obviously
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
with with Communications with the
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
banking Department as laid out in the
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
bill uh further question I'm looking at
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
page seven
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
here page seven is the banking
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner has totally control over
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
this this sand box so there is a teacher
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
who overlooks the sandbox
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
correct sort of but have to here here's
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
the thing that that got me you could say
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
is you're looking for a time frame right
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
the time frame is
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
that the commission the banking
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
Department excuse me is going to
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
assess all the fin all the people who
 
01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
are being assessed now to fund the bank
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
and so to me they might just say we
 
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
don't want this assessment we don't want
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
we don't want to pay into this thing and
 
01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
that will put a kyos to it right out of
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
the get right out of the block it'll
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
never happen so the banking Department
 
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
would have to approve the length of time
 
01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:14.679 align:start position:0%
uh further question further question
 
01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the bill says uh what would
 
01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
happen if the test failed the what the
 
01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
participant is supposed to do if the
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
test failed but it as far as I could
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
tell it doesn't say what should happen
 
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
if the test succeeds that is what the
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
participant is supposed to do after the
 
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
end of a successful test I I would say
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
if uh the test is successful we should
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
then legalize whatever framework was in
 
01:36:45.310 --> 01:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
that test that's on us to I see that you
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
think that that should be it would come
 
01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
to us and we would then put it in our
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
statutes so we would then revise the
 
01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
statute correct thank you okay did you
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
do did this is your okay represent Aon
 
01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:02.950 align:start position:0%
do did this is your okay represent Aon
yes

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
I no we've already heard from her right
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
oh really yeah well I I believe that but
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to I'm supposed to have
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
everybody go give their one question
 
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
before they can ask a second question
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
we've done this 63 times already this
 
01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
year all right good good morning
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative so you can't tell us
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
products that would be in this permitted
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
under this bill and so and understand my
 
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
question is based on someone who has
 
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely lived through two Banking
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
crisises and been in business and had to
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
deal with this
 
01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
crap uh
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
the so you can't tell us what it might
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
be can you tell us what it is that we
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
can't based on this has to go to the
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
banking commissioner and it would have
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
to come before this committee to change
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
the RSA what opportunity is it that
 
01:38:09.629 --> 01:38:09.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't already exist because my concern
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
is would you believe that Wells Fargo
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
Bank of America US Bank and City Bank
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
sued the banking Commission in the state
 
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
of Vermont in in 200
 
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
six because they were too restrictive on
 
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
the mortgage lending practices in that
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
state and by
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
2009 when Vermont had virtually no
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
banking failures and the rest of the C
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
country where these Pro these Pro these
 
01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
products were allowed New Hampshire
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
mercifully just had a stronger economy
 
01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh they withdrew their
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
lawsuit so I want to understand what
 
01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity are we if we if we change
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
nothing in our law if just if we stay
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
right where we are what opportunity is
 
01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
it that we're missing that if I am a
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
banker and I decide I want to do
 
01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
whatever thing we don't know what it is
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
what is it that opportunity that the
 
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is missing out
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
it's doing US economic harm sure I I
 
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
just think in the light in the context
 
01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
of emerging Technologies and emerging
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
products especially in the financial
 
01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.030 align:start position:0%
products especially in the financial
services

01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
industry there's not like if there was
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
an answer for what product we're missing
 
01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
out on today it would already be gaining
 
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
stream around the country we already
 
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
know it I think it's allowing that next
 
01:39:32.189 --> 01:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
big thing to start developing in New
 
01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and it and it may fail it
 
01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
may succeed and and setting up the
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
sandbox for that Innovation to take
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
place so there's not there's not a list
 
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
of products that I can point to as that
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
could come to New Hampshire with this
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
legislation it's just allowing for the
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
planting of seeds within that sandbox to
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
see what it'll
 
01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.790 align:start position:0%
see what it'll
grow

01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
grow
 
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
further question may inquire
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
so all
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
right what's wrong what is the
 
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
restriction on our procedures now what
 
01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
is it that the banking commissioner
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
can't allow or why why are we you know
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
what's the what is overly burdensome now
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
if I have some new product I won't offer
 
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
credit cards at 2% or whatever crazy
 
01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
thing they want to do well I would say
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
right now without this leg ation the
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
statutes don't allow wouldn't allow an
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
Innovative product to come through so
 
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
this is for across the board products
 
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
that statutes don't currently allow for
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
them to be able to work with the baining
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner to provide a a limited
 
01:40:36.589 --> 01:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
offering of it to see how it can work in
 
01:40:36.599 --> 01:40:38.990 align:start position:0%
offering of it to see how it can work in
New

01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a Chicken and the Egg
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
problem here right okay thank you very
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
much thank you okay we'll have the bank
 
01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner who with her Council
 
01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
bill what a pleasure it is to have you
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam commissioner thank
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to speak with
 
01:41:08.589 --> 01:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
you today my name for the record my name
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
is Amelia Galder and I'm the bank
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the State of New
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with me is general counsel
 
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
Seth saki for the banking department so
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
the bank as stated the banking
 
01:41:21.149 --> 01:41:21.159 align:start position:0%
department is neutral about the con cept
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
of a Sandbox um however I do have
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
significant concerns about how this
 
01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
particular bill is drafted um I'm going
 
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
to talk about some of the kind of more
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
procedural aspects that I'm concerned
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
about and I'm going to turn it over to
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
Seth to talk about the more scary things
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
so because I have a lawyer and he can do
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
that um okay so from a procedural
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
perspective um I don't think this bill
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
is set up appropriately with regard to
 
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
funding so the banking department is a
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency we're completely
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
funded by the entities that we currently
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
license through fines fees penalties and
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day an assessment on
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
banks credit unions and Trust companies
 
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
this bill did not include a fiscal note
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
for us um and to make this happen I
 
01:42:07.229 --> 01:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
think the banking Department probably
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
needs at least four positions an
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
attorney a paralal an administrator and
 
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
an investigator to to figure this out
 
01:42:17.709 --> 01:42:17.719 align:start position:0%
because we have no rules about this
 
01:42:19.229 --> 01:42:19.239 align:start position:0%
right it's setting up a whole new
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
program we don't have the resources
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
currently staff to do that um so that's
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
kind of the funding issue that I see
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
right out of the gate um the other
 
01:42:32.109 --> 01:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
component of it is that the it's kind of
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
set up once it's going to be
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
theoretically funded by the applicants
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
to the program H however
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
um right now the banking department has
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
a pretty reason I think pretty
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable fee structure that's set by
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature um if you think you need
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
a license from us it's around $500
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
depending on license type and then we
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
have an examination regimen that people
 
01:43:00.189 --> 01:43:00.199 align:start position:0%
um pay for or entities pay for with a
 
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
per DM fee we scope those exams to the
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
to the size and complexity of the entity
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
um so we try to keep them reasonable um
 
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
we have a good relationship with our
 
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
lenses certainly if somebody has an
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
Innovative product I always want to hear
 
01:43:17.310 --> 01:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
about it so I was actually intrigued to
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
find out what Innovative product they
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
feel is being being prevented because I
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
always want to know about that I sat on
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
the cryptocurrency commission set forth
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
by the governor um I try to work with
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
anyone who's interested in any new
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
product um so I'm kind of intrigued to
 
01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:35.719 align:start position:0%
know what's out there that's somehow I'm
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
blocking from happening because I want
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
to know about it um and I think it our
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
current structure allows that and New
 
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a unique State and that if
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
something is prevented by our laws
 
01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
people can come in here and tell you
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
about it and we can work with them to
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
come in and tell you about it and work
 
01:43:57.390 --> 01:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
with a solution so I'm not sure that I
 
01:43:59.950 --> 01:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
just I'm interested to know what who who
 
01:44:01.629 --> 01:44:01.639 align:start position:0%
wants to do this because I want to work
 
01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
with them um so that's kind of a a
 
01:44:07.229 --> 01:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
principle that that I'm concerned about
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
um another issue is confidentiality so
 
01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
theoretically if we drafted rules and
 
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
people came to us with an application
 
01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
for an Innovative product presumably
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
that application and the design of that
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
product would be subject to some kind of
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
comment period I would imagine um it
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be a public matter um I think in
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
other states that's been how this has
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
been set up and the issue with that is
 
01:44:35.310 --> 01:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
if you have an in truly Innovative
 
01:44:37.149 --> 01:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
Financial product you don't want to tell
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
everyone about it right out of the gate
 
01:44:41.229 --> 01:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
because then you know you'll have even
 
01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
as it is that's you know not how things
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
work now and we still have like right to
 
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
know requests that come in for anytime
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
we get applications filed
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
um it would be all in the public domain
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe in other states I think
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
Arizona I think there was one in maybe
 
01:44:59.589 --> 01:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
West Virginia or Kentucky I'm sorry I
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact data in fresh in my
 
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
brain but if you go and look at what
 
01:45:05.589 --> 01:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
other states have done with sandboxes
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's why they failed because
 
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately nobody wants to apply because
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
then their Innovative Financial product
 
01:45:14.669 --> 01:45:14.679 align:start position:0%
becomes public um which eventually it
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
does anyway when you go to the market
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
but like that initial startup of that
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
product can you I imagine you don't want
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
that to be public um so those are kind
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the procedural aspects and I'm going
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
to turn it over to S to talk about the
 
01:45:30.589 --> 01:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
rest okay good morning chairman hunt
 
01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
Seth Zaraki I'm the general counsel at
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire banking department so
 
01:45:38.589 --> 01:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to discuss really three
 
01:45:40.350 --> 01:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
additional areas of potential concern
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
relating to HB
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
157 um first as you know uh the sandbox
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
that would be created by this bill would
 
01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
be administered by the banking
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
department and while uh you know we
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the confidence that the bill
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
drafters have placed in us to run the
 
01:45:57.310 --> 01:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
sandboxes for all Financial Services I
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
think it's important to recognize that
 
01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
we at the banking Department are experts
 
01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
in banking and certain um Consumer
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
Credit Industries we aren't for example
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
experts in the Securities laws or the
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
Securities industry so while the bill
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
envisions that the banking department
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
will consult with applicable state
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
agencies um in administering the sandbox
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
and in um reviewing applications the
 
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
ongoing supervision of the sandbox
 
01:46:25.950 --> 01:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
participants appears to be left to the
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
banking Department alone uh and with
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
current Staffing and resources I think
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to say that the banking
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
Department would be equipped to oversee
 
01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
the sandbox with regard to financial
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
services that are outside our normal
 
01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.870 align:start position:0%
services that are outside our normal
regulatory

01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
purview uh the second area I wanted to
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
address are some consumer protection
 
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
issues um and there's three in
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
particular first if a consumer of a samp
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
box participant has a complaint where
 
01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
would that consumer go to file a
 
01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
complaint and what process what would
 
01:46:59.070 --> 01:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
the process be by which that complaint
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
is resolved presumably I would expect
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
the consumer would come to us at the
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
banking department at least in the first
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
instance and then we may need to consult
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
with the applicable state agency but
 
01:47:12.669 --> 01:47:12.679 align:start position:0%
that process isn't uh provided for in
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
the bill that's drafted and in our
 
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
experience at the banking Department
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
having a clearly defined uh statutory
 
01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
process for resolving consumer
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
complaints is very useful tool for both
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
mediating and resolving uh uh concerns
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
between consumers and business the
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
second area is that the bill is drafted
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
does not appear to require clear and
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
conspicuous uh disclosures to Consumers
 
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
of sandbox participants so for example
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
should a Sandbox participant be required
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
to to disclose to the consumer that it
 
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
does not hold a license from the New
 
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire banking Department should a
 
01:47:49.149 --> 01:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
Sandbox participant be required to
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
disclose to its consumer r that it is
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
operating under a temporary test that
 
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
could end uh in theory at any time there
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
may be other disclosures um that should
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
be made to ensure consumers understand
 
01:48:04.270 --> 01:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what they're dealing with um and
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
then the the third area I wanted to
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
discuss is what happens in the event of
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
a security breach um of the consu of the
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
computer systems of the sandbox
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
participant I think this could be a
 
01:48:18.189 --> 01:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
concern um for companies that are that
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
are using new um or emerging
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
Technologies as this bill is designed to
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
do and um so what are the sandbox's uh
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
participants obligations in the event of
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
a security breach the bill as drafted
 
01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
does not expressly address this so those
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
are the three consumer protection issues
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
that we believe are absent from this
 
01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
bill and need further um exploration and
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
these are fundamental consumer issues
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
that we believe should be addressed
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
directly in the statute um finally I
 
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on the effective date of
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
this bill um as drafted the ACT would
 
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
take effect on July 1 of this year um
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
the banking department does not believe
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
that that date is feasible given that
 
01:48:58.510 --> 01:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
the time given the time and the
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
resources that we've discussed that
 
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be needed to um get the sandbox up
 
01:49:05.470 --> 01:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
and running um so that concludes my
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
prepared remarks I had one more thought
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
as Seth was talking um another thing we
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
talk about when we come before this
 
01:49:12.669 --> 01:49:12.679 align:start position:0%
committee a lot is the exemption to the
 
01:49:14.669 --> 01:49:14.679 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act so one thing
 
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
that's not really clear in this bill is
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
is it an entity that's already licensed
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
by one of our agencies and is trying to
 
01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
do a product or is it an entity that's
 
01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:25.189 align:start position:0%
do a product or is it an entity that's
wholly

01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
wholly
 
01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
unlicensed and wants to come before us
 
01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
without a license like you know and then
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
how does that interplay with the
 
01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act of exemption um
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's really not clear to me from this
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
um and is concerning because there I in
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
my opinion there's nothing worse than
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
not knowing what jurisdiction something
 
01:49:44.669 --> 01:49:44.679 align:start position:0%
falls under it can create complete
 
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory confusion um so that is also
 
01:49:49.709 --> 01:49:49.719 align:start position:0%
I think a concern about this bill that I
 
01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
want to flex flag um so thank you uh for
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
hearing us and if you have any questions
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them so you said other
 
01:49:58.189 --> 01:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
states have passed this uh I don't know
 
01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
about this version exactly but a Sandbox
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay they had the concept yes right so
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
has anything ever come out of I don't
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
believe so I'd have to go and look but
 
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding is very few people I
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if in any of these examples I
 
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
looked at that anyone actually applied
 
01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
for anything and that it and most of
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
them in like the two I looked at they
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
Sunset it after a while um so just by
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
operation of law the sandbox possibility
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
went away perfect okay represent
 
01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
you back to a very Elementary Point uh
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
do either of you know why this bill does
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
not have a fiscal note no there the
 
01:50:41.229 --> 01:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is
 
01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
determined um by uh the speaker uh when
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
they look at the bill they uh this you
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
know look at and see is there's a fiscal
 
01:50:52.350 --> 01:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
need for a fiscal note and then send it
 
01:50:54.669 --> 01:50:54.679 align:start position:0%
to the department to generate the fiscal
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
note um given that the department is
 
01:51:02.109 --> 01:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
self funded maybe they just thought that
 
01:51:03.629 --> 01:51:03.639 align:start position:0%
the license insured entities would
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
absorb the
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
cost I don't know of course all those
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
banks that are not federally chared
 
01:51:11.109 --> 01:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
would just love to pay for
 
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
this so thank you representative M uh
 
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:17.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman would would you
 
01:51:20.109 --> 01:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
believe that this reminds me a little
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
bit of that uh Fiasco with the gentleman
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
selling notes which were a security out
 
01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
of the Meredith Savings Bank and that
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
was something that uh the bank
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner at that time waved all
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility for um which I think he
 
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
should have I think the guy that was
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
doing that was operating his own little
 
01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
sandbox and uh and and really again that
 
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
should have been registered security any
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
comment on that I mean nope okay well we
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
have a separate Securities Division I I
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
understand that that's why this I think
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
they made the point that that the
 
01:51:59.830 --> 01:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
banking commissioner is is not
 
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily in a position to to cover
 
01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
all of this that's true representative
 
01:52:07.629 --> 01:52:07.639 align:start position:0%
Terry uh so I take it from your
 
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
testimony that you think this bill uh
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
needs a lot of work you need a lot of
 
01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:15.639 align:start position:0%
help uh with this but I did um ask the
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor if there were those behind him
 
01:52:19.709 --> 01:52:19.719 align:start position:0%
who might be able to cite examples for
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
us so in your research I think I heard
 
01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
you say you couldn't find anything even
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
though other states apparently have
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
enacted this legislation and some of the
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
legislation I heard you say has
 
01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
sunsetted so did so in fact did I hear
 
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
you correctly that you did not find any
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
examples of anybody who wanted to play
 
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
and was allowed to play in the sandbox
 
01:52:44.669 --> 01:52:44.679 align:start position:0%
and what happened in the sandbox I don't
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
have any I could not find any examples
 
01:52:48.069 --> 01:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
in a preliminary search but I'm happy to
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
go and do more research for any work
 
01:52:49.599 --> 01:52:51.069 align:start position:0%
go and do more research for any work
session

01:52:51.069 --> 01:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
thanks okay repres thank you Mr chair
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I I missed
 
01:52:58.030 --> 01:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
the your introductory words so I
 
01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.109 align:start position:0%
the your introductory words so I
apologize

01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna I'll set up my question I
 
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
filed a bill and I think uh you and I
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
spoke about it on the phone ailia uh
 
01:53:11.189 --> 01:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
about a while ago yes a while ago and I
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
I I I didn't think uh it would get
 
01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
through this committee so I withdrew the
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
bill to save myself some grief so uh but
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
it was about um uh State chartered banks
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
that were not FDIC insured so that would
 
01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
be a financial product and there's
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of like fintech Innovation
 
01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
happening uh in that space um there's
 
01:53:34.109 --> 01:53:34.119 align:start position:0%
there's a bank out of Wyoming called
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
custodia I think they're registered in
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
our state uh and they are a State Bank
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
they're not FDIC insured they don't lend
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
money so they don't have that risk of
 
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
fractional banking that most banks do uh
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
and they have a lawsuit with the SEC
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
because the Federal Reserve isn't
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
granting them uh an account with the
 
01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve and so it's it gets to
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
that dual banking uh concept so if
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
somebody and and uh a little further uh
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
the state of coneticut
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
allows uh uninsured State Banks they
 
01:54:11.950 --> 01:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
have a certain Charter type that we
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
don't have that was what my bill was
 
01:54:15.310 --> 01:54:15.320 align:start position:0%
about but that would I think that would
 
01:54:19.149 --> 01:54:19.159 align:start position:0%
fall into a category of this legislation
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
where it's Financial product that we're
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
not really sure about it's still kind of
 
01:54:26.069 --> 01:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
shaking out in the GR in the larger
 
01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
economy but this sandbox idea would and
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but you know is
 
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
that a correct understanding um so when
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
I think about the sandbox we talk about
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
products in in my my understanding of
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
what you were discussing with me in the
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
fall was more of a whole Charter type um
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
it wasn't exactly like a speedy from
 
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
Wyoming but I think a speedy from
 
01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
Wyoming a special I always forget what
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
Speedy stands for special purpose dep
 
01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
institution yep one of those um this
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
committee has considered those before um
 
01:55:05.069 --> 01:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
and it um the bill got changed into a
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
different form um I think that goes to
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
what I was saying in my testimony
 
01:55:12.669 --> 01:55:12.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps before you got here that one of
 
01:55:14.589 --> 01:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
the nice things about New Hampshire is
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody has an idea about something
 
01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
like that they can pick up the phone and
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
call me call you um we can come before
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
this committee and figure out if that's
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
um the direction the legislature wants
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
to go in I'm not sure you need a Sandbox
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
to do that and further I would actually
 
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
be more concerned about I feel like
 
01:55:33.550 --> 01:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
something like that should be fully
 
01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
thought out and it should be fully
 
01:55:37.870 --> 01:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
fleshed out by the legislature um and it
 
01:55:41.069 --> 01:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
deserves that kind of attention whereas
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I think this is much narrower and
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
whenever I hear it spoken of it's about
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
products and when I think of like a
 
01:55:49.149 --> 01:55:49.159 align:start position:0%
financial product I think of like a
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
specific type of loan or you know maybe
 
01:55:54.910 --> 01:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
a very narrowly drawn business model
 
01:55:56.589 --> 01:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
that's aimed to get at something but
 
01:55:58.109 --> 01:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
again I don't know exactly because I'm
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
not sure what this sponsor had in mind
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
um for a product that would be um
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
subject to the sandbox but I think what
 
01:56:09.790 --> 01:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
you described to me perhaps could fit
 
01:56:11.709 --> 01:56:11.719 align:start position:0%
under a money transmitter if I remember
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
correctly under our current regime
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps could be its own Charter type
 
01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
but in my mind that's too big a concept
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
for a Sandbox I would be nervous about
 
01:56:21.149 --> 01:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
that in a sandbox I would want the
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
guidance of the legislature to set that
 
01:56:27.149 --> 01:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
up and I really think that's is hitting
 
01:56:27.159 --> 01:56:29.109 align:start position:0%
up and I really think that's is hitting
the

01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
nail which is when I said chicken of the
 
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
egg because your job is to regulate and
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
inforce the statutes yes you and the
 
01:56:40.589 --> 01:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
idea the idea that we're going to give
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
you permission to you know create a
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
guinea pig and create a test model and
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
then come back and say oh this is great
 
01:56:50.350 --> 01:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
we we should put it in our stat statute
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
is again it's it's out it's a you know
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
you're getting the in front of the the
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
truck in front of the trailer but you
 
01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
know it's so you and I think it it
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't um take into account the nice
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
things that we have about New Hampshire
 
01:57:05.950 --> 01:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
how accessible the legislature is how
 
01:57:08.069 --> 01:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
how um involved how at the banking
 
01:57:10.069 --> 01:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
Department we take everyone's call about
 
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
any product and are happy to talk to
 
01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
them so you know so but again the way I
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
read this is that that it's going to be
 
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
something that theoretically statut
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
would not be possible that's the reason
 
01:57:23.709 --> 01:57:23.719 align:start position:0%
why they're coming to you if it was
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
statutorily possible they would just go
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
ahead and do it so what I read this bill
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
is that it is there's something
 
01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
fundamental about it that is the the
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
current state law violates it and he
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
says you can't do it to come and ask the
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
enforcer of that statute to say um won't
 
01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
you you know let me go and experiment
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
over here is just right for abuse and
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm and I'm happy to engage like I
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
really want to know what these entity
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
like if people perceive that our laws
 
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
are blocking some Innovative Financial
 
01:57:56.830 --> 01:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
product I want to know what you would
 
01:57:58.109 --> 01:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
want to know I would want to know so I
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
could come to you and talk so you can
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
come and and put in legislation to
 
01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
change that yeah fair enough okay we all
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
sent oh representative pelli thank you
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it's
 
01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:12.679 align:start position:0%
it's interesting concept but it
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
definitely puts a lot of responsibility
 
01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
on your department to look at the test
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
the test terminate the test my question
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
is about liability I mean the product it
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to be a retail
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
type product it could be an Innovative
 
01:58:32.589 --> 01:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
in tech product but as far as liability
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
goes if it doesn't whatever it is and it
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't work and the LI liability is
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
significant and there is harm who would
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
be on the hook
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
to make restitution and as we see from
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
bank failures it's the tax taxpayer so
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
how I'm I'm not sure that's outlined in
 
01:58:56.109 --> 01:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
the bill no and do you have any insight
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
into that no I don't um and that was
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
what I was um uh speaking directly to
 
01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
about the exemption from the consumer
 
01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
protection act because if somebody is
 
01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
subject to the consumer protection act
 
01:59:11.310 --> 01:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
they're um the Attorney General's office
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
has jurisdiction over them and consumers
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
can sue that company directly for treble
 
01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
damages whereas if somebody if some an
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
is under our jurisdiction we have
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
restitution Authority in our statutes to
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
obtain restitution for that consumer um
 
01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
if appropriate and bring in enforcement
 
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
action and I think that's that's
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
something that's missing from the
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
statute that clarity about
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much oh do
 
01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:41.560 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert has a
 
01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
question um my question is basically I
 
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
was very surprised to hear
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
your uh response in in the sense that
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe the banking
 
01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
department is that entity that this
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
gentleman was addressing I was surprised
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
that I was surprised that he put you on
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
the on the spot and the fact of the
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
matter is um the financial sector is uh
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
incredibly complicated it's very uh
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
inventive already and um I don't I
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
really don't want to hear my banking
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner say oh yeah sure let's talk
 
02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
to me because I don't I don't consider
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
that to be your job and and so um
 
02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of I mean as somebody who
 
02:00:36.669 --> 02:00:36.679 align:start position:0%
sold options in derivatives and that
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
sort of thing I know she made it very
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
clear that that is part of the
 
02:00:42.589 --> 02:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
awkwardness of this bill that you're
 
02:00:45.629 --> 02:00:45.639 align:start position:0%
asking her to be participant of
 
02:00:47.390 --> 02:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
activities that doesn't fall under her
 
02:00:51.149 --> 02:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
Ro what I was waiting to hear was it's I
 
02:00:52.669 --> 02:00:52.679 align:start position:0%
I am the banking commissioner and I
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
don't think it's appropriate for me to
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
give any uh advice appointed border Mr
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
chairman do we have a question or this
 
02:01:04.109 --> 02:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
sounds argumented my question is why did
 
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
why did you uh come in
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
neutral I mean from my perspective it's
 
02:01:12.189 --> 02:01:12.199 align:start position:0%
an it was a ridiculous uh well okay so
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
that all right that's what would you
 
02:01:16.109 --> 02:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
believe that's would you believe I would
 
02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
like to know why you why you consider
 
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
yourself neutral in this particular
 
02:01:23.550 --> 02:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation recommended
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
legislation so from a perspective of is
 
02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
a Sandbox a good idea that's how I'm
 
02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
neutral you all get to decide it I'm the
 
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
person who provides you with facts about
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
what I if you tell me you want a Sandbox
 
02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
it's my job to explain to you how I
 
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
think that sandbox should be set up and
 
02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
operated in a way to protect consumers
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what I mean when I say neutral
 
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
like from a policy perspective I don't I
 
02:01:48.270 --> 02:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
don't set the policy the legislature
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
sets the policy
 
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
and I can give you advice about it
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon she's not the same
 
02:01:56.430 --> 02:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
I just have another question thank you
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
um just while you're here uh we've had
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
discussions about a stable coin uh you
 
02:02:05.310 --> 02:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
know regulatory framework um something
 
02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
like that would fall into the sandbox
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
could potentially fall into the sandbox
 
02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just throwing that out there while
 
02:02:11.709 --> 02:02:11.719 align:start position:0%
you're here you know if you have any
 
02:02:15.149 --> 02:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
ideas on it I'd have to see what that
 
02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
means so I don't I'd have to think about
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
it all we can talk sorry we can talk
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
about after and that might be State
 
02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
treasur anyways yeah that
 
02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:24.550 align:start position:0%
treasur anyways yeah that
that

02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay but in my mind just so you know
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
what I've been discussing with him is is
 
02:02:31.390 --> 02:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
that I have a problem with yet the bull
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
it just needs to be a private entity it
 
02:02:35.629 --> 02:02:35.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be yeah I wasn't business that
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
could be regulated by the banking
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
department so I wasn't talking about a
 
02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
bullion depository oh you were talking
 
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
about something different oh okay so
 
02:02:48.030 --> 02:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay I was wrong I was wrong I
 
02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:49.510 align:start position:0%
okay okay I was wrong I was wrong I
misunderstood

02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstood
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%

chair and members of the committee for

the opportunity to testify here today uh
 
02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
my name is is Sarah Scott and I'm the
 
02:03:22.069 --> 02:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
deputy state director for Americans for
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
Prosperity here in New Hampshire uh this
 
02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
is a different committee for me usually
 
02:03:27.790 --> 02:03:27.800 align:start position:0%
I am in a different one so it's nice to
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
be here and meet all of you um I'm here
 
02:03:34.109 --> 02:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of HB 1507 so I
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
know we've talked a lot about what
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
exactly uh a regulatory sandbox is um so
 
02:03:41.069 --> 02:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
I kind of wanted to dive into a little
 
02:03:42.589 --> 02:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
bit more of your questions rather than
 
02:03:44.109 --> 02:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
the testimony I was prepared to give
 
02:03:46.589 --> 02:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
today um that would be great so
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
essentially the regulat sandbox is a
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
testing ground for new Innovative
 
02:03:55.629 --> 02:03:55.639 align:start position:0%
products or Services um it's essentially
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
a way to keep the consumer safe while
 
02:03:59.790 --> 02:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
allowing the business the opportunity to
 
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
come up with new innovative ideas and to
 
02:04:04.589 --> 02:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
have that discussion with the regulators
 
02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
and kind of figure out what are the gaps
 
02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing why like what is
 
02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
currently blocking them from having
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
these kinds of products so I don't think
 
02:04:14.669 --> 02:04:14.679 align:start position:0%
the goal is to um cater this to a
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
specific business that's saying you know
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
something is currently blocking us
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
because I do agree that if the case is
 
02:04:21.669 --> 02:04:21.679 align:start position:0%
that there's something a current law or
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
regulation we do have the process to go
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
through the legislature and address that
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
I think this is more focused on products
 
02:04:31.709 --> 02:04:31.719 align:start position:0%
that we don't know how they fit yet into
 
02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
our regulatory structure uh Financial
 
02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
technology in part particular is just
 
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
moving at such a rapid Pace that our
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
regulations just can't necessarily keep
 
02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
up with it um so something that even if
 
02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
we updated which we do rules and
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
regulations every single year somebody
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
is always coming up with a new idea that
 
02:04:53.109 --> 02:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
we just hadn't even thought of so this
 
02:04:55.470 --> 02:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
provides that framework to work with the
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
regulators and the banking commission to
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
kind of figure out what that looks like
 
02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
so that we could come to the legislature
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
and say these are the things that we
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
need to change for all
 
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
businesses um so right now I think 14
 
02:05:09.549 --> 02:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
states have passed a framework for this
 
02:05:12.189 --> 02:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
some kind of sandbox some are looking
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
specifically at the financial technology
 
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
industry some of them are broadening
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
that out to Encompass other Industries
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
as well uh but right now there are 14
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
states that have passed that and I
 
02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
believe that there are only 14 states
 
02:05:28.510 --> 02:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
that have not considered the legislation
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
or aren't in the process of that right
 
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
now so it's definitely something that a
 
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
lot of other states especially in the
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
Northeast I think uh Massachusetts is
 
02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
looking at this legislation this year um
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
I did hear something about Rhode Island
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
as well I can't speak to the specifics
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
on that that was just something that um
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
somebody had shared with me yesterday um
 
02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
so it's something that I think is going
 
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
to be a continu conversation over the
 
02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
next several years as more and more
 
02:05:53.950 --> 02:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
States look at how they are going to be
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
kind of that Beacon for Innovation and
 
02:05:58.270 --> 02:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs and so I think really this
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
is a lot about showing businesses that
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
we are the spot to welcome them in that
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
we are happy to work with them to figure
 
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
out how their business might fit in with
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
our current structure or what needs to
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
be changed I know we do have a very
 
02:06:12.669 --> 02:06:12.679 align:start position:0%
accessible legislature and the banking
 
02:06:15.549 --> 02:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
Department um I think that giving kind
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
of like a framework for this and saying
 
02:06:19.870 --> 02:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
we have a sandbox is a great way to be
 
02:06:22.270 --> 02:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
that Beacon that we like to be um in
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
general for New Hampshire you know we
 
02:06:25.709 --> 02:06:25.719 align:start position:0%
like to pride ourselves on being the
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
place that people want to move to
 
02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's um you know the best place
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
to raise a family the best place to
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
start a business we also want to be that
 
02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
Beacon uh in the Northeast for
 
02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs and innovators to make
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
sure that they are looking to us as a
 
02:06:42.669 --> 02:06:42.679 align:start position:0%
place to start up their
 
02:06:45.709 --> 02:06:45.719 align:start position:0%
Industries um I did want to
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
mention see the uh this is has been a
 
02:06:51.149 --> 02:06:51.159 align:start position:0%
bipartisan movement uh across all of
 
02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
these states so it's not something that
 
02:06:55.069 --> 02:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
it's only Republicans or only Democrats
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
working on I always really enjoy seeing
 
02:06:59.189 --> 02:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
that bipartisan effort people working
 
02:07:01.069 --> 02:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
together on this I think it's a very
 
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
complicated issue and definitely
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
something that's going to need some
 
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
thought and work um but I think it would
 
02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
be something that you know a lot of
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
other states are considering and it' be
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
important for us here in New Hampshire
 
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
to uh do the same happy to take
 
02:07:15.950 --> 02:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative Terry has a
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
question so I'm sitting here and I'm
 
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
reminded of the move
 
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh The Matrix and the question is he the
 
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
one and I'm wondering is she the one are
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
you able to give me examples you've
 
02:07:30.149 --> 02:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
cited 14 states where this legislation
 
02:07:32.589 --> 02:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
has been ected are you familiar enough
 
02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
with this issue so that you can give us
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
an example or two of what and why so
 
02:07:40.589 --> 02:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
thank you yes so I'm going to look it up
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
on my phone here I have the list open
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
there are currently 37 businesses that
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
have gone through or are currently in a
 
02:07:50.189 --> 02:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
sandbox across the 14 States so it's not
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
something that we're seeing you know
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
like 40 or 50 businesses applying for in
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
every state I think it's something that
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
for the most part we're expecting that
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
the regulations aren't overly bomson but
 
02:08:02.189 --> 02:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
there are some Innovative Technologies
 
02:08:06.030 --> 02:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
that we haven't kind of come for yet
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
follow so since there are 37 can you can
 
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
you site one descri
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
yes why it's in yep that's what I was
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
just getting to next have the list open
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
here um so for example I'll just read
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
off one of them uh called grain
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
technology Inc so it's an application
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
that offers consumers personalized
 
02:08:31.390 --> 02:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
saving plans and credit opportunities
 
02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
through their existing bank account um
 
02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
there's another one Omni Mobile Inc uh
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
which is a financial service platform
 
02:08:41.669 --> 02:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
implementing an array of uh Technologies
 
02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
to improve today's payment systems
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
through the utilization of direct AC uh
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
payments through om Central CZ wallet
 
02:08:51.709 --> 02:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um a lot of these I'll
 
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
say I don't have the technological
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to understand the technology
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
but there's a list that I'd be happy to
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
send around of what those uh different
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
businesses are that would be great it's
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
it's listed on like the what the states
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
yes it's listed on each of the states
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
websites so I'll just send you the link
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
to each of the states so you have to
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
click through and see that that would be
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:19.149 align:start position:0%
 
spear

02:09:19.149 --> 02:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
spear
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
I want to say this question correctly
 
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
but uh we just heard from the banking uh
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner that they have some very
 
02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
serious concerns about consumer
 
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
protection and the bill has nothing in
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
there for that in
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
reality and you you said that this was
 
02:09:42.350 --> 02:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
all for the consumer and you know
 
02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
stressed all that even in light of the
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
fact that this bill has no consumer
 
02:09:51.149 --> 02:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
protection uh are you folks considering
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
rewriting this or just leaving it this
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
way I am not the author of this bill um
 
02:09:59.589 --> 02:09:59.599 align:start position:0%
so I couldn't speak to the original
 
02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
intent but I believe this is the
 
02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
language that was passed in other states
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
so I think it would be fine to I don't
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
think the intent of this is to uh you
 
02:10:11.310 --> 02:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
know take people out of that consumer
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
protection act I think that adding
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
Clarity to that could be helpful um I
 
02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't have an opposition to that so
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
represent spirit I will entertain the
 
02:10:21.310 --> 02:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
question but can we be a little more
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
specific to the bill or something rather
 
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
than rather than the 6 excuse me I'll
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
just go by the link the links that she
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
said I will go to the state all the
 
02:10:32.830 --> 02:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
states and go look it all up perfect
 
02:10:36.189 --> 02:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
great see none thank you very much thank

we feel that there are some good ideas

behind this however the actual um lack
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
of parody across Commerce is an issue
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
there's a number of other issues with
 
03:38:16.189 --> 03:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
this bill I'll try and um illuminate
 
03:38:19.229 --> 03:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
that but the cost to the consumers in
 
03:38:20.950 --> 03:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
the industry right now are pretty
 
03:38:23.110 --> 03:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
prohibitive they're running in single
 
03:38:25.830 --> 03:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
digigit margins and um this is just not
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
the time to introduce this particular
 
03:38:30.429 --> 03:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
type of legislation but if the economy
 
03:38:31.590 --> 03:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
should get better it's certainly
 
03:38:33.510 --> 03:38:33.520 align:start position:0%

spear in expedient to legislate seconded
 
03:43:17.790 --> 03:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
by represent
 
03:43:20.149 --> 03:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
bullo represent spe you recognize to
 
03:43:22.469 --> 03:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion okay yeah yes thank
 
03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
you uh this bill wanted to uh ban the
 
03:43:30.189 --> 03:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
ability of a producer of a manufacturer
 
03:43:33.149 --> 03:43:33.159 align:start position:0%
for selling uh products that were geared
 
03:43:35.309 --> 03:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
towards women specifically at a higher
 
03:43:39.229 --> 03:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
rate than those de uh geared towards men
 
03:43:41.710 --> 03:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
however uh it would be almost according
 
03:43:44.309 --> 03:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
to the uh justice department it would be
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to tell the difference
 
03:43:50.309 --> 03:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
between such a deliberate act and
 
03:43:51.550 --> 03:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not it had anything to do
 
03:43:53.149 --> 03:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
with a production run for instance if
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
something is pink for instance it may
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
have a very short production run and
 
03:43:58.910 --> 03:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
therefore cost more money just because
 
03:44:02.189 --> 03:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
of that so since is almost unenforcable
 
03:44:05.830 --> 03:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
and we had no one here uh claiming that
 
03:44:07.830 --> 03:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
they had Dam been damaged by this we
 
03:44:10.990 --> 03:44:11.000 align:start position:0%

03:48:43.750 --> 03:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
18 liquor bills in which obviously the
 
03:48:45.990 --> 03:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
candid was considered one of them um we
 
03:48:48.750 --> 03:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
will we will spend the rest of the day
 
03:48:51.110 --> 03:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
discussing in subcommittee the liquor
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um all those different
 
03:48:55.229 --> 03:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
bills and what we want to do with them
 
03:48:58.510 --> 03:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
so um that that will be Tuesday and then
 
03:49:02.309 --> 03:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
we'll be executing on Wednesday uh
 
03:49:05.030 --> 03:49:05.040 align:start position:0%

motion

03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
motion
 
03:55:44.030 --> 03:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh the the original Bill uh had in it
 
03:55:47.670 --> 03:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
some uh features that uh well let me
 
03:55:49.790 --> 03:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
start from the beginning th this bill
 
03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
and the amendment was made uh as a
 
03:55:56.429 --> 03:55:56.439 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort to address a very
 
03:55:58.429 --> 03:55:58.439 align:start position:0%
severe problem that's happening in New
 
03:56:02.309 --> 03:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with respect to the pest uh
 
03:56:04.229 --> 03:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
contamination that we face in our
 
03:56:08.149 --> 03:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
wellwater and our land waste in uh
 
03:56:10.469 --> 03:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
products that we use most
 
03:56:14.149 --> 03:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
commonly uh with the a very high past
 
03:56:17.590 --> 03:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
load the original Amendment had in it
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
some uh some uh labeling
 
03:56:25.070 --> 03:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
requirements and uh another couple of
 
03:56:27.389 --> 03:56:27.399 align:start position:0%
features and in order to address the
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
opposition those features were taken out
 
03:56:32.710 --> 03:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
so it's essentially the same bill as
 
03:56:35.429 --> 03:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
what it was before but we addressed all
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
opposition discussions that went on in
 
03:56:41.550 --> 03:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
the committee meeting and the final bill
 
03:56:44.349 --> 03:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
is represented by this uh
 
03:56:46.510 --> 03:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment we're going to with this
 
03:56:49.990 --> 03:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and if we pass it it joins 14
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
States in trying to address this problem
 
03:56:56.510 --> 03:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
some states have taking much more severe
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
approaches than we're
 
03:57:01.950 --> 03:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
taking but we feel in this environment
 
03:57:04.189 --> 03:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
that this is the best bang we can get
 
03:57:07.269 --> 03:57:07.279 align:start position:0%
for our buck if you will in addressing a
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
us

03:57:14.030 --> 03:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:57:16.630 --> 03:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
great okay any other discussion on the
 
03:57:19.710 --> 03:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
motion represent Ammon thank you I just
 
03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:21.439 align:start position:0%

bill I'm going to be voting yes on the
 
03:57:25.630 --> 03:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
amendment and no on the final passage of
 
03:57:28.030 --> 03:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm worried that we're Banning
 
03:57:29.870 --> 03:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
products that are useful in the
 
03:57:32.910 --> 03:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
marketplace without hard concrete
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
evidence to support it and I'm not
 
03:57:36.630 --> 03:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
discussing the bill I'm stating my my
 
03:57:40.830 --> 03:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
03:57:46.469 --> 03:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
Axton uh my position is exactly the same
 
03:57:49.750 --> 03:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
as that of Representative
 
03:57:49.760 --> 03:57:51.990 align:start position:0%
as that of Representative
Ammon

03:57:51.990 --> 03:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
Ammon
 
03:57:57.670 --> 03:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay so um I I got a phone call uh or
 
03:57:59.870 --> 03:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
actually an email from Bia and telling
 
03:58:01.469 --> 03:58:01.479 align:start position:0%
me they want to be in opposition to this
 
03:58:04.229 --> 03:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
bill and I go well where have you been
 
03:58:06.710 --> 03:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
and that we have multiple times I have
 
03:58:09.349 --> 03:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
asked for if there's any opposition to
 
03:58:11.510 --> 03:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
this bill please speak up forever more
 
03:58:15.070 --> 03:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
hold your peace um having said that um I
 
03:58:19.269 --> 03:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
do believe that we have narrowed it to
 
03:58:21.670 --> 03:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
with this amendment we have narrowed it
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
down to uh only a handful of items uh
 
03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
but that upon my insistence we have uh a
 
03:58:35.469 --> 03:58:35.479 align:start position:0%
section for um uh exemptions and I will
 
03:58:37.870 --> 03:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
I go on public record right now on
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
YouTube that any company in New
 
03:58:43.750 --> 03:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that has a product that they
 
03:58:43.760 --> 03:58:44.790 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that has a product that they
cannot

03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
03:58:47.790 --> 03:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
replace uh please and then somehow got
 
03:58:50.670 --> 03:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
included in this list please let me know
 
03:58:53.910 --> 03:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
and we will absolutely look at it and
 
03:58:56.830 --> 03:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
and and consider to adding it to the
 
03:58:59.630 --> 03:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
exemption list but at this point the
 
03:59:02.550 --> 03:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
problem is that um I think even
 
03:59:04.830 --> 03:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturers probably have no idea
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
whether there's PS in their products or
 
03:59:08.910 --> 03:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
not because they're getting from third
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
party suppliers who may or may not tell
 
03:59:14.269 --> 03:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
them that what's in in that product
 
03:59:15.790 --> 03:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
representative spear there was a
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
requirement by the EPA that everyone
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
every manufacturer and distributor of
 
03:59:25.229 --> 03:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
pasas put their P formulations into a
 
03:59:28.830 --> 03:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
database that the EPA is responsible for
 
03:59:31.469 --> 03:59:31.479 align:start position:0%
so they better pretty quick on figure
 
03:59:35.229 --> 03:59:35.239 align:start position:0%
out whether or not they have pasas so I
 
03:59:37.269 --> 03:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
don't think that they can really rely on
 
03:59:39.349 --> 03:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
just pretending they don't know know and
 
03:59:41.189 --> 03:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
we heard Witnesses especially from the
 
03:59:44.349 --> 03:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
dees that said if there is a question
 
03:59:47.469 --> 03:59:47.479 align:start position:0%
the dees will test it right and they
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
have that capability and that and that's
 
03:59:52.830 --> 03:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
really in terms of the other piece that
 
03:59:54.590 --> 03:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
we've done in this bill is to model it
 
03:59:57.070 --> 03:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
what we did with Mercury in terms of
 
03:59:59.910 --> 03:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
creating this uh clearing house uh using
 
04:00:02.389 --> 04:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
a a Consortium of other states and the
 
04:00:04.950 --> 04:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
Clearing House and so that we're not
 
04:00:07.469 --> 04:00:07.479 align:start position:0%
Reinventing the me the wheel here and
 
04:00:09.149 --> 04:00:09.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with pas we are basically
 
04:00:11.710 --> 04:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
picking up where where we did with
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
Mercury and I'm pretty sure I don't see
 
04:00:18.309 --> 04:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
any Mercury around um the end of the day
 
04:00:20.830 --> 04:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
I the most important thing the message I
 
04:00:22.910 --> 04:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
want everyone to understand is was
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
driving this legislation is the waste
 
04:00:31.149 --> 04:00:31.159 align:start position:0%
system and that is that if um if if I
 
04:00:34.030 --> 04:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
was Waste Management who did come in and
 
04:00:35.990 --> 04:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
support of the bill um I would be
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
deathly afraid that that this product
 
04:00:40.349 --> 04:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff would show up in my
 
04:00:43.070 --> 04:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
landfill without me knowing it and then
 
04:00:46.389 --> 04:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
it somehow seeped out and they would be
 
04:00:49.269 --> 04:00:49.279 align:start position:0%
liable and so it's already there there's
 
04:00:51.070 --> 04:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
no doubt past is everywhere right it's
 
04:00:54.670 --> 04:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
in all of us already we just don't know
 
04:00:57.990 --> 04:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
how much we have so so the idea is that
 
04:01:00.990 --> 04:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
this somehow we've got to to stop the
 
04:01:03.510 --> 04:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
train uh and terms of having this past
 
04:01:06.149 --> 04:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
showing up into our waste
 
04:01:09.070 --> 04:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
system so with that the clerk will call
 
04:01:11.189 --> 04:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
the role on ought to pass on the
 
04:01:11.199 --> 04:01:13.510 align:start position:0%
the role on ought to pass on the
amendment

motion
 
04:04:42.189 --> 04:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
this is a motion to interim study HB
 
04:04:44.510 --> 04:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
1674 this bill establishes the New
 
04:04:46.990 --> 04:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal tender act establishes
 
04:04:49.469 --> 04:04:49.479 align:start position:0%

04:04:56.269 --> 04:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
this proposal being a complex
 
04:04:57.670 --> 04:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
combination of public and private
 
04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders requires greater study
 
04:05:01.349 --> 04:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
before this committee can make an
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
informed recommendation to the house we
 
04:05:05.149 --> 04:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill be moved to interim
 
04:05:10.189 --> 04:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:12.990 --> 04:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon uh thank you Mr
 
04:05:16.950 --> 04:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
chair so I will be uh voting against ANM
 
04:05:19.349 --> 04:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
study and I just want to explain why uh
 
04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
first of all it's my bill so I don't
 
04:05:25.110 --> 04:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
want to vote against myself um but I
 
04:05:26.670 --> 04:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
want to make it clear I want to I I
 
04:05:28.269 --> 04:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
would like to write a minority blurb and
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
just make it clear that there was an
 
04:05:32.510 --> 04:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that limited the bill down
 
04:05:35.710 --> 04:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
to just the legal tender portion and uh
 
04:05:37.149 --> 04:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
and I'll say some things in the blur
 
04:05:39.149 --> 04:05:39.159 align:start position:0%
about the size of the national debt and
 
04:05:42.189 --> 04:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
how we're approaching what's called a
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
multi-polar world where dollar dominance
 
04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
may not be around much longer um because
 
04:05:51.030 --> 04:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
other countries are are doing things
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
that circumvent the dollar so we have to
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
think about that as a state
 
04:05:58.429 --> 04:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
because if inflation comes home to roost
 
04:06:01.110 --> 04:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
then that affects our our citizens so
 
04:06:03.910 --> 04:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
that that would be my my thinking behind
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh going against the committee and I
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
realize I may be alone in that but I'm
 
04:06:09.990 --> 04:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:11.870 --> 04:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on the motion
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
of interim study for 1674 question yeah
 
04:06:18.830 --> 04:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
so to uh representative ammon's
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
concern uh if the bill is approved to go
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
to interim study is is his concern still
 
04:06:30.990 --> 04:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
alive and and therefore it it could come
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
back to us uh with a broader scope than
 
04:06:38.950 --> 04:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
what it has apparently been narrowed
 
04:06:42.149 --> 04:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
to um may I ask representative Amon that
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
question sure uh so um interim study is
 
04:06:49.790 --> 04:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh death With Dignity for the bill so
 
04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's how I'm looking at this and and
 
04:06:54.510 --> 04:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
and it's okay um the amendment just
 
04:06:56.830 --> 04:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
narrowed it down to one portion the bill
 
04:06:57.990 --> 04:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
had three different parts that narrowed
 
04:07:00.269 --> 04:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
down to one my my preference would have
 
04:07:02.590 --> 04:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
been to work on that and uh get that
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment passed but I realized that's
 
04:07:08.910 --> 04:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
not feasible so uh that's my assessment
 
04:07:10.870 --> 04:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry I naively believed that
 
04:07:12.389 --> 04:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
it was actually going to be studied
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
rather than go to die thank
 
04:07:19.070 --> 04:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
you um obviously I I will always take
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
the perception that any bill that's in
 
04:07:22.990 --> 04:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
our committee when we have whether we
