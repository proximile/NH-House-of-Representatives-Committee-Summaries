yours thank you Mr chairman uh John
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
McDonald I'm the representative for uh
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
kale district 6 which is the towns of
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
wolf bro and Tuftonboro
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh EOS engine cut off switch uh back
 
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
between 2018 and 2020 uh the federal
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
government Coast Guard the boting
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturer started looking ways they
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
could possibly uh uh save some lives uh
 
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
out on the Waterway and what they came
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
up with was uh this ecos and uh if you
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
don't know what that is I've got one in
 
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
my pocket if it's okay with you Mr
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll just pass it around go
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
right ahead there's a this in here plugs
 
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:00.039 align:start position:0%
into the the uh by the shifting lever
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
and once it pulled is pulled out it
 
00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
kills the motor this can be worn on your
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
your jacket your PFD or around your
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
wrist like this so if you fall out of
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
the boat this has some certain expansion
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
this will pull out from the shifter and
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
motor and if I can just get that back
 
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
from everybody because they won't be
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
able to stop their boat unless they have
 
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.950 align:start position:0%
able to stop their boat unless they have
it

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
so around 2020 uh the federal government
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
adopted some regulations one that the
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
manufacturers uh boats after 2020 had to
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
be manufactured with one of those engine
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
cut off switches uh so any boat
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
manufactured after 2020 will have that
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
automatically no extra cost it's just
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
put up by the
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer uh some of the Marine
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
dealers that I spoke to they give
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
training on new boats and how that works
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make sure they use it the
 
00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
right way and also that they can't
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
startop their bone L is plugged in so uh
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
what it does uh the benefits of it
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
prevents unnecessary accidents injuries
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
and death caused by a boat operator
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
being unexpectedly thrown from the helm
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh this also includes situations where
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
the operator is rejected from the boat
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
which typically leads to a runaway boat
 
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
in these scenarios anyone in the water
 
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
faces potential propeller cuts and
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
Strikes the boat can also collide with
 
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
the vessels and it also puts uh Mar
 
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
Patrol officers in danger and they have
 
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
to risk their lives or whatever to go
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
and try to take control of the boat
 
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you as you can see by the law
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
itself uh it only applies to boats
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
manufactured after
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
2020 uh they have to be less than 26
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
feet and they can't have an enclosed
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
cabin other exceptions are if you are in
 
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
a boat that's uh less than 26 feet
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
manufacturing 20121 if you're going
 
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
Headway speed say you're trolling or
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
fishing whatever you don't have to wear
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
that going into a dock or anything like
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
that uh I guess that's about the whole
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
the whole bill and any questions I'll be
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
answer I'll go s from there and come
 
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
come right
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
back thank you thank you Mr chair um yes
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
so thank you for taking my question um
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
the concern I have with this bill is
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
exactly the Headway speed um language
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
you know back in I don't have my notes
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
in front of me but it was 2019 I think
 
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire law uh was changed
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
to uh redefine Headway speed it used to
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
be defined as um the the slowest speed
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh possible to uh maintain steerage or
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
six miles an hour and then the or six
 
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
miles an hour was removed um the there's
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
I am the reason I'm concerned is exactly
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
what you brought up which is trolling um
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
trolling uh people that troll often have
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
kicker motives right especially for um
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
salmonoid species and um it's not clear
 
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
to me how the um how the cutof switch
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
would work on those kicker Motors um
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
those um you know doing a little bit of
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
research people will troll somewhere
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
between you know one and a half to up to
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
three sometimes five I don't think in
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire maybe but up up to five
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
miles an hour um and it seems to me
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
based on the current definition of
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
Headway speed and the definition in this
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
bill that that's more um 5 mil hour
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
would be more than Headway speed so I'm
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
concerned how this would affect um uh
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
trolling in particular um if you could
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
comment on that yes thank uh thank you
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
for the question the the trolling mtiv
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
that I've seen are all small horsepower
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
like two three horsepower somewhere in
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
there and if you were going under
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
Headway speed you wouldn't have to have
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
oh the remaining steerage yeah yeah I
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
saw that it had Chang for years it was a
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
six miles per hour and I'm not quite
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
sure why it was uh why it was changed um
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
again this is something that uh this
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
kind of images or mirrors the uh the
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
federal law and uh I don't know exactly
 
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
states have adopted this there some that
 
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
have adopted have adopted something
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
similar what surprised me when I started
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
looking at this uh you know personal
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
watercraft they're not required to have
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
wear one of those the jet skis um they
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
have them but they're not required to by
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
law required to wear
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
one I hope that answered your question
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
as best I could for a followup thank you
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um so I did research the
 
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
federal law as well the federal law
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
actually um talks about on plane for
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
motor boats or I don't know exactly the
 
00:22:59.789 --> 00:22:59.799 align:start position:0%
term for for sailboats but it's it's
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
basically based on the the wavelength
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
for sailboats um which is a big
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
difference um like there's a lots of
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
people of course that um on the lake
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
that where my cap uh Camp is on that you
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
know put putt around in their pontoon
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
boats they're not going Headway speed
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
for sure but they're surely not on plane
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
either they're going about five miles an
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
hour or something like that I don't
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
think that those people would be
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
particularly impacted by that because
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
they're not trying to get up and grab a
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
line and things like that um but the
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that it's based on the
 
00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
federal law but there is a substantial
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
difference between this and the federal
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
law because the federal law really does
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
say um uh I'm sorry uh planing you know
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
planing and I'm wondering why it wasn't
 
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
sort of word for word for the federal
 
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
law with the federal law this is the the
 
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
federal law that I I saw includes these
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
these facts these these points I haven't
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
seen the one that you've spoken about uh
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
speed okay thank you uh for taking my
 
00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
question did you say that if um it comes
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
out they can't start the uh vote again
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
did I hear that correctly yes unless
 
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
they push it back in okay so what if
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
they lose
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
it it fall into the water somehow then
 
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
they can't get get where they want to go
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
well hopefully they have it around their
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
wrist like or they have it clipped to
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
their their pants or their bathing suit
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
or possible life jacket if they really
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
want to be safe
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
boers okay the big thing is is if you
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
think about in the fall there's not a
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
lot of people out there boting no matter
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
what lake you're on and if you fall out
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
of your boat on a boat when it's in gear
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
you got to pull it out of gear to stop
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
it to put it in neutral that boat's
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
going to keep on going this way it pulls
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
out it shuts down the boat and you can
 
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
swim back to the boat and get Board of
 
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.830 align:start position:0%
swim back to the boat and get Board of
the

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
taking our questions um just a quick
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
background I've owned a number of these
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
boats and pretty familiar with those
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
potentially life-saving devices because
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
I've fallen off you know fallen out or
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
fallen off watercraft before um but I'm
 
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
also familiar with the what they can
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
hinder you a bit too especially if you
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
have to move around your your watercraft
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
quickly to help somebody or move
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
somebody or get somebody life jacket or
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
whatever specifically in the case of I I
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
want to ask you about the 26 foot rule
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
my first two Jet Boats were bow Rider
 
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
style jet boats that could hold eight or
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
10 passengers um an 18-footer was was
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
one and another was a 22-footer and they
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
were they had large engines in them 350s
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh in board jet drives
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
um as a prudent voter I think
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
you're just it's Reckless to not wear
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
one for your own safety kind of like
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
riding in my car I would always consider
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
wearing a seat Bel I always wear a seat
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
belt in in the
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
car so my question is how did you get to
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
26 feet and can you define enclosed
 
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.950 align:start position:0%
26 feet and can you define enclosed
cabin

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's the number that the uh federal
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
government the Coast Guard the
 
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
manufactures came up with 26 20 uh less
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
than 26 feet uh the big thing to
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
remember is this only applies to boat's
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
manufactured after uh 2020 anything
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
before that wouldn't be required to have
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
that uh I think in a closed cabin there
 
00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:52.510 align:start position:0%
that uh I think in a closed cabin there
pretty

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
much you know you get a Boston New well
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
that's not in closed cabin you got some
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
speed boats that have a roof that would
 
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
be enclosed cabin it would have to be up
 
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.389 align:start position:0%
be enclosed cabin it would have to be up
to

00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
someone's there's some things you can't
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
really always Define that's perfect but
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
if you go to court you can Define
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
explain to the judge what enclosed cabin
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
is I
 
00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
think there may be a definition
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere in in one of the regulations
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
to defines that I'm just not aware of it
 
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
you so I haven't found an enclosed cabin
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
definition but I guess what I'm asking
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
about more specifically are the smaller
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
boats say a center console with a on top
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
that or a a smaller boat like my older
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
boats 18 22 foot where you have a bimin
 
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
and you can add sides and things like
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
that I mean they call that a full
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
enclosure it's not a hard enclosure is
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
the idea is the thinking behind that
 
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
language to exclude a boat that has
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
something else that will keep the
 
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
operator inside the boat is that what
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
you mean right yes okay so it doesn't
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
have to be wall with doors it could
 
00:27:58.679 --> 00:27:59.710 align:start position:0%
have to be wall with doors it could
literally

00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
literally
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
be the you know the canvas and then the
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
question is do you have to have the
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
canvas rolled down rolled up anyways I
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
find that language a little problematic
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
for all those reasons okay maybe uh
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
Chief dun Captain duny can explain a
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
little bit better he's got a lot of
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge on that stuff I think I I get
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
the possibility sorry um I just think
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
that the language in the bill has to be
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
fixed careful on the back and forth I
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
apologize represent R for a question
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um representative
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
McDonald I'm really proud to be a
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill but one thing
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
that we didn't discuss is was this uh
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
the Genesis of this bill due to a
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
specific incident I know there was a
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
marac resident um Christine Lavoy and
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
her friend uh Suzanne fulam who risked
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
their life to save a a runaway boat I
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
believe it was last year they were
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
honored and conquered December 11th was
 
00:28:59.950 --> 00:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
this was that incident a Genesis of the
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
spill that it may be there was a an
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
incident on L wi basaki where uh there
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
was a runaway boat and two Marine Patrol
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
officers tried to stop the boat and the
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
boat ran over their patrol boat flipped
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
it over and they all wented at the water
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that was the same one
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about or not okay uh
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
I think it was off of bear Island uh
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
you any other questions uh

00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
will say that we've uh worked with
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald on the language
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
of this bill as it does closely resemble
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
the current federal law um
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
this uh request from Marine Patrol uh
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
for this bill is a result of years of
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
circumstances where we are experiencing
 
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
runaway boats where the operator for
 
00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:34.039 align:start position:0%
whatever reason has been ejected from
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
the boat and the boat continues down the
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
lake sometimes straight if it has a
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
power steering mechanism sometimes
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
performing what we refer to is The
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
Circle of Death if there's no power
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
steering uh we see anywhere from six to
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
12 of these a summer and often times
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's smaller rowboats where a young
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
child has been distracted ejected while
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
operating the tiller motor but we've
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
also see it uh in in larger Craft um and
 
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
and the the length of 26 feet mirroring
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
the federal law is based on statistical
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
data that the Coast Guard collects every
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
year looking at Falls overboard and it
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
is very apparent
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly uh these types of
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
incidents happen on boats under 26 ft
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
and there therefore you see the language
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
before you
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
um you will see within the bill there is
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
a definition uh for Headway speed as it
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
as it uh appears currently in voting
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
statutes um in New Hampshire um planing
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
is the term that is used at the federal
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
level uh we used Headway speed because
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
it is really the speed that leads you up
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
to a planing speed uh on the water um so
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
we were looking to use consistent
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
language as well as an enclosed cabin um
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
we've defined the enclosed cabin in this
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
bill and it uh means a space on board a
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
vessel that is surrounded by bulkheads
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
and covered by a roof bulkheads are a
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
rigid uh side and um would prevent
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
someone from being ejected overboard
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
that is the purpose representative
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
McDonald showed you the lanyard type
 
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
switch which when you fall overboard or
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
leave the helm exceed the length of the
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
lanyard it does Tri trigger button on
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
the dash next to the shifter that stops
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
the engine in the event someone is
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
injured or is overboard and there's
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
another passenger on board you just flip
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
that lever that is tripped by the loss
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
of this lanyard and you can restart the
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
boat and go around and perform the
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
rescue if you're by yourself the engine
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
stops you can perform a self- rescue by
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
swimming back to the
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
boat some may think that this lanyard
 
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
will become
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
cumbersome folks they now sell regularly
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
in installed in our state by marinas a
 
00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
little chip a fob that can be worn in a
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
a bracelet it can be worn in a little
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
pager type device on your belt it can be
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
just slipped in your pocket so that that
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
when that operator and you can actually
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
program the distance from the wheel that
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
that uh you must break before the engine
 
00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:18.509 align:start position:0%
that uh you must break before the engine
will

00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
start they put them often times on dog
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
vests because we have dogs that fall
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
overboard passengers wear them you can
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
have up to four devices per boat
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
cordless so that if anyone Falls over
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
including your pet the engine will stop
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh and then can be overridden with a
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
push of a button on the dash uh but it's
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
a conscious uh maneuver to be able to
 
00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
restart the
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
boat as representative McDonald said we
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
did have an incident last summer where
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol officers uh had a large
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
boat doing circles after hitting a rock
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
both passengers were
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
rejected um the boat was doing about 20
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
mph erratically it had power steering so
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just doing circles it was
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
going in all directions in an attempt to
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
disable that boat that boat struck the
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
patrol boat flipped it and the officers
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
were caught underneath the air bubble
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
within the underside of their patrol
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
boat and were dragged about 200 yards
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
before they were able to get out from
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
under the patrol boat and the two women
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned were the ones that came to the
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
rescue of the two officers happened
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
about midnight on Lake wiip Pasad um but
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
we see I have stories Galore of 12T
 
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
rowboats a young girl on Lake uh Winona
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampton the tiller slipped out of
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
her hand she got ejected it started
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
doing the Circle she was wearing a life
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
jacket thank you thank you the prop of
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
that 9.9 horsepower engine got tangled
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
up in the straps and the foam of her
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
jacket and it stalled the engine and her
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
brother was able to then lift the engine
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
up uh preventing her from from drowning
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
so these this happens more often than
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
than you might be aware and it's it's
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
just a safety mechanism that now is
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
convenient for the operator boats many
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
boats have been equipped with this
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
device for many years it only has been
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
since 2020 where the feds are requiring
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
boat manufacturers to equip it and it's
 
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
not only boats but for your smaller
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
outboard motors the motors themselves
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
are equipped with this
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
device I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
that you may have
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
um we we're looking at this from a
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
view represent
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
representative Q fail
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
then thank Mr chairman Mr dunby thanks
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
so much for um for coming today and
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
pointing out the enclosed cabin so let
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
me ask you about that first it mentions
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
bulkheads bulkheads aren't generally
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
decide designed to keep people in the
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
boat it's the gunnel and the and the
 
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
height of the freeboard that does that a
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
bulkhead is typically as you I'm sure
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
know but for anybody listening or
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
anybody here in the room who doesn't
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of boats bulkhead is that
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
structural part like the door between
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
the cabin you know down below the
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
sleeping space and the salon or
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
something like that so should we change
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
gunnel we could but I I first we are
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
using the the
 
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
language um to remain consistent my
 
00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:33.079 align:start position:0%
concern with just gunnel is that gunnels
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
only come up to a half three and a half
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
we don't know the height of a gunnel
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
depending on the style of the boat um
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
that sometimes we had a fisherman who
 
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
was leaning over tending to a fish and
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
because of the length of his legs and
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
the height of his gunnel his feet went
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
out from under him and he went over um
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
if the gunnel is high enough to prevent
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
someone being
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
ejected um
 
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
use I don't know that it would do it in
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
all circumstances sir respectfully for a
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
followup the the followup is um you
 
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned this happens a lot and and we
 
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
hear about it anecdotally and we don't
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
like knee-jerk you know one kind of
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
thing like one traffic accident we
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
should pass a seat Bel law or something
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
like that of course we have a lot of
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
traffic accidents um so I'm really
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
curious how many how do you enforce it
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
like how many violations do you think
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to issue because of this
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
will your current staff enforce that and
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
where is the fiscal
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
note um from an enforcement perspective
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
first of all we have it depends on the
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
season obviously but we have I would say
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
between six and 12 a year where this
 
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
happens um from an enforcement
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
perspective this isn't something that
 
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
officers are going to be just stopping
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
boats randomly to check for their
 
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
lanyard I I see this as an enforcement
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
action that
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
happens either post accident or incident
 
00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
or at the time of a a vessel stop uh
 
00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's it would be very rare that an
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
officer from a distance could see this
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
violation occurring because it's it's
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's hard to see
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
um it is it is an issue that um I would
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
say at least six times a year around our
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
more oh let me go
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
around then we'll come back if you have
 
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.589 align:start position:0%
around then we'll come back if you have
another

00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
question representative Vale and
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
representative organ what happened to
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
your your your name tag your name plate
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
oh there it is now I can see it oh yeah
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
these are glasses okay
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
Captain Dunley for taking my
 
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
question um so I'm just looking at mine
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
for the bill engine cut off
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
switch so there's a list of devices here
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
would that include every kind of device
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
that we would be using IF to call it an
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
ecos so for example you have a lowte
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
version of an ecos on the table but you
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
also have the chip which is more of a
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
high tech way so I just want to make
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
sure this covers everything because
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes when I see lists I think what
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
there I I understand your question
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative and uh yes it would
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
include all if if uh you would like to
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
to amend the language to to add a phrase
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
or similar devices if you're more
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that we are certainly
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
fine with
 
00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
that thank you for taking my question
 
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
certainly representative pan thank you
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
question uh with regard to the uh switch
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
if is there a penalty aspect to this if
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
I jury rig the boat so that that thing
 
00:39:59.790 --> 00:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
is in position but I'm I'm not attached
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
to it and you have an in and there's an
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
then I would representative it's a good
 
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
question and I would have to check I
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
believe there is a catchall statute that
 
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
refers to violations within this chapter
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
will be a violation or penalties so it
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
would be a violation with an
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
undetermined uh fine set by the
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
McHugh did you have a you had a question
 
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.270 align:start position:0%
McHugh did you have a you had a question
and

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
then okay representative Derby thank you
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um thank you um Captain Dy
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
would you be at all amenable to um
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
somehow I think by current definition of
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
Headway speed uh it is so you're looking
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
to include trolling in the requirement
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
no to exclude trolling from requiring an
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
EOS I believe it's already ex uh
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
Exempted um the Headway speed statute uh
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
says not to uh Headway speed is a
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
minimum well it's it's it's before you
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
um exactly as it appears in other
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
sections of uh the statute um it allows
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
for the maintaining of steerage I can
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that the reason that language
 
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
exists is because some of our currents
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
on our Sea Coast exed 6 miles hour and
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
we were having difficulty uh with boats
 
00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
having to uh obey a law for Speed under
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
bridges at Headway speed when the
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
current was doing more than that more
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
than six Inland water we do not see this
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
as an issue majority of boats can
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
achieve Headway speed well below six
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
miles per hour um and and
 
00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
certainly perhaps on the Sea Coast funa
 
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
or something like that any fish that
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
you're looking to catch in our state is
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to be well below that um so I I I
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
I I'm I would happy to
 
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:05.079 align:start position:0%
entertain trolling uh being Exempted
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
under six miles per hour um it certainly
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
you any other questions by members of
 
00:42:16.829 --> 00:42:16.839 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
representative thanks for taking another
 
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.069 align:start position:0%
representative thanks for taking another
question

00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
um I know when I operate my
 
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.710 align:start position:0%
um I know when I operate my
outboard

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
outboard
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
it's that device is I think on one of
 
00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%
them is I can't start the motor because
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's I think uh got some electronic
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
coating on it but another one I could
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
definitely start it but there's nothing
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
that says I have to connect it to me or
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
anything else and I usually have a put
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
my Wrist through it as I grab the tiller
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't I mean is there is
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
there something in here that talks about
 
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh or that should talk about the proper
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
use of it because I think like someone
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
someone else just mentioned you can
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
connect it start it you're using it but
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's not really being used properly
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
because because it's not connected to
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
the operator right uh I think um the
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
Roman two uh starting at line 11
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
requires that uh any boat with um
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
horsepower must be wearing the wearing
 
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
you I can respectfully if I may yes Mr
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I recognize that this statute
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
some may look at this as a helmet law or
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
seat belt law um we tend to look at it
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
from a Marine Patrol perspective similar
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
to the snowmobile skimming law it is the
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
after effect that happens when somebody
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
is ejected and that boat is running
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
loose it's not only endangering the
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
operator but it's also and we've had
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
this we have this happen if we are
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
unable to get there in time and disable
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
that boat it is ultimately landing on
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
Shore it's endangering swimmers
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
docks property um and First Responders
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
who are trying to float a floating line
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
that hopefully the propeller catches
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
installs the motor we've had boats that
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
we we partially hook onto the engine it
 
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
changes the direction of the uh the
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
motor and suddenly that robo's a rocket
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
ship heading for sure somewhere so it's
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's the after effects that often times
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
whether it's endangering the operator or
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
those responding or those who are
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
victims on Shore uh We've seen all of
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
that thank you for that opportuni any
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
other question by members of the
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh I do have one question I
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
think it follows on to representative
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
Horgan question on
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh is you say that this is
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
in a list would be in a list
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
infractions uh and what what would be
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
the uh what of not doing this what would
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
be the uh the penalty in in a general
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
sense it would be the lowest level of
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
penalties a violation like not wearing
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
your life jacket uh viol violation level
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
offense with a fine set by the court
 
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
okay and if if this is a continuous
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
thing is there somebody refuses and it's
 
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
builds up you know habitual offender is
 
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
there something beyond that in the and
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
even just in general sure uh right now
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
there are no points attached to voting
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
violations other than voting well
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
intoxicated uh so multiple offenses we
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
would have to ultimately see that this
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
person is is truly um in
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
intentionally uh ignoring the law and at
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
that point we might have to go after
 
00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
something administratively but would it
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
would have to be after multiple
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
violations and and final question is
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh how does if somebody if somebody
 
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
falls out of the boat and this happens
 
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
okay we got you but how do you uh how do
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
we enforce it in a in a prior situation
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
where the person's not wearing it but
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
you you don't you're not going to see
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
them from uh from another boat how how
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
does the officer uh able to know that
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
somebody is or is not wearing this
 
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
especially if you have those uh those
 
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
electronic ones uh there is a challenge
 
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you that you would be
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
surprised and and for those of you who
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
are voters it's amazing the number of
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
people you see who are operating boats
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
who will step away from the steering and
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
the helm to oh to do different things
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
about the boat as the boats going down
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
the lake that is where
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
I Envision us making stop op s for this
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
um aside from coming upon it after the
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
fact I got
 
00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.190 align:start position:0%
fact I got
you

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative all right so that last
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
part you just said is different than
 
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
what you said previously so you just
 
00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:12.559 align:start position:0%
said you do Envision making stops as a
 
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:14.559 align:start position:0%
primary violation for it in that
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
circumstance if you see somebody
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
standing two feet away from the helm so
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
you Invision stopping them and enforcing
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
and and then letting the court set a
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
random fine that we don't know what that
 
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
fine is
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
because you see somebody one foot away
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
with their hand off the hel uh
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
representative I am fine if you would
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
like to amend this and and put language
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
in there that it's a secondary offense
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't be able to primarily
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
stop people for that that that's fine um
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
as as uh the chair uh questioned you
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
know when when could we see it there are
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
times when we see people who are walking
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
about their boat um away from the helm
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
uh but but your wishes we serve
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
certainly would our ultimate goal is to
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
these representative Derby for a final
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
question I hope yes thank you very very
 
00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
briefly um but it appears actually that
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
with the fob that they'd actually be in
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
compliance walking around because like
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
you said there's a there's a you know
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
there's a degree of Freedom that's
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
provided and in fact with the fob it
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
seems like it would be impossible to
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
stop some body we if we assume that the
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
fob were in use it' be impossible to
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
stop somebody because it might just be
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
in their pocket in the circumstance of
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
sir I representative you add your hand
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
up if you want if you have a question
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
and a question then I'll get blind in
 
00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:52.839 align:start position:0%
um W with the fob and a stop being made
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
all they have to do is produce the the
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
fob and say they have the cut off switch
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
if they're thrown out is that correct
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
yes but if uh when you have the fob you
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
have a display on your dashboard that
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
actually tells you your distance um that
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
you can leave uh where it's programmed
 
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
and you can actually see if there's
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
multiple fobs on the boat say for the
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
dog um the the primary fob is the
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
operator fob and that limits you to a
 
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:23.799 align:start position:0%
certain distance from that that main
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
reader the passenger f fobs can be
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
greater distances um can they swap fobs
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely but there is a display
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
showing that information thank
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other questions thank you
 
00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.950 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other questions thank you
very

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
much me uh I think that's it call thank
 
00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
you for your time okay just uh just a
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
reminder that we are do doing exing next
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
week so this bill will be on the uh
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
exing if if you have any
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
amendments get them in this uh so we can
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
discuss them best to get amendments in
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
be before the the executive session
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
with more speed with that I will close
 
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:15.750 align:start position:0%

Boston House Bill 1049 is the result of
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
a request from some of my conu
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
constituents many of which are here
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
today it is a b bipartisan bill that I
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
strongly endorse and wholeheartedly
 
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
support I say
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan because there are three of us
 
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
on there myself as sponsor one
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
Republican and one Democrat who joins us

today representative
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
Lehman I am sure that this committee's
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
members are familiar with the concept of
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
a Great Bond under that concept all
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
bodies of water within this state in
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
excess of 10 acres a held in trust for
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
the public that concept is well
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
rooted in common law and has always been
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
the rule in New Hampshire dating back to

Colonial
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
times this bill is about the concept and
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
the trust that it
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
creates 1049 could not be more simple
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
the bill deletes section three of RSA

01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
terms
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
used in its simplest term a house boat
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
is any craft with sleeping and toilet
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
facilities section two of the law
 
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
protects the land owners AB buding a
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
great boat on and we all wholeheartedly
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
support that section and their
 
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
rights section three of the current law
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
prohibits watercraft with sleeping and
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
toilet facilities from overnighting on a
 
01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.589 align:start position:0%
toilet facilities from overnighting on a
great

01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
Pond section three of RSA
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
270a is in my opinion in direct conflict
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
with the concept of a Great
 
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.069 align:start position:0%
with the concept of a Great
Bond

01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
with the concept of a Great Pond and the
 
01:07:04.269 --> 01:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
waters being held for trust in trust for
 
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
the use of the public I don't believe
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
that that lell concept was intended only
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
for the daylight hours to my knowledge
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
none of the other New England states
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
have any such
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
prohibition I have tried to put this
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
proposal in the lofty context
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
of our state being a trustee for the
 
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
public I'm sure other speakers who
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
actually own boats will deal with the
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
more practical side of both the current
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
section three and our
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
proposal please vote
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
OTP and send the proposal to the Full
 
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
House for its
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you I'm happy to
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may
 
01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
have any questions by represent
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you Mr chair
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative for taking
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
my question um would you uh expect that
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
this change in the law would permit um
 
01:08:09.789 --> 01:08:09.799 align:start position:0%
overnight house boats um occupied
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
overnight house boats and if so would it
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
be multiple nights in a row would that
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
well thank you for asking that question
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
when when I um propose a draft for law I
 
01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
thought about adding a lot of things to
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
it but everything I thought about adding
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
basically is already in voting law
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
either in this law or some other voting
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
law uh the one area that I thought the
 
01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
committee might want to consider and
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
that we would not be opposed to would be
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment an amendment that said that uh
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
you could only overnight for say three
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
or four consecutive days in a month that
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
would prevent anyone from trying to take
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
lake representative rung for for a
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so Suppose
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
there is uh someone who's staying on the
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
house boat for three or four consecutive
 
01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
nights but they're renting it like it
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
they're using it as an
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
Airbnb um would you suppose that they
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
would be obliged to pay rooms and Mills
 
01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
tax which is currently levied against
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
airbnbs on
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
land I guess we'd have to look to the
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
detail of that law but I would think so
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
you any other questions by members of
 
01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.910 align:start position:0%
you any other questions by members of
the

01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative wolf you look
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
like you're ready okay thank you Mr
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
question do you have any references to
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
somebody that may be out there for a
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
lengthy period of time if you're talking
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
two or three days with toilet
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
facilities excuse me toilet
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
facilities um the whole definition of a
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
house boat is currently contained in the
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
law uh requires that the boat have
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
toilet facilities sanitary facilities
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
and sleeping facilities so U I guess uh
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
we could look to the current definition
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
definition or a
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
followup I'm not familiar with the
 
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
current law but does that mean that if
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
you're staying overnight you have to
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
have toilet facilities on the boat it
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
youn the cour thank you chair um this is
 
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
rather could be indelicate uh we had a
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
representative last term that had to do
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
with house boats uh on great ponds and
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh the gist of the
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill well it the the the reason for
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
bringing it Forward was that the the
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
toilet facilities which are adequate uh
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
is a rather loose definition I believe
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
in a lot of circumstances
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
and to be to be blunted can be just a
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
bucket um so that's
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
um do you have any information about
 
01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
what sort of toilet facilities are
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
required because I think that's the some
 
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
of the issue here at hand thank
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
you uh I'll be very honest I haven't I
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
haven't done any boating for many many
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
years um so I'm not an expert on on
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
boating and the and the facilities but
 
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh I would look to the law for the
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
definition of the of what what
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
facilities are required and if those are
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
inadequate we certainly would be uh you
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
know we'd be amendable to making them
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
on me do okay all right okay we'll we'll
 
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.830 align:start position:0%
on me do okay all right okay we'll we'll
get

01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
to anyone else for a question uh
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%

01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
members of the R&amp;D committee again my

name is Tim dun Ley I come before you
 
01:12:57.629 --> 01:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
today uh on behalf of the the New
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Marine Patrol uh the
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on this uh bill as
 
01:13:04.629 --> 01:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
it is uh proposed to you today however
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
we did want to bring to your attention
 
01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.310 align:start position:0%
we did want to bring to your attention
as

01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
submitted um this is going to allow uh
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
anyone who chooses to vacation in our
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
state or residence to come up drop
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
anchor overnight on any of our Inland
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
Waters and spend the day the week the
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
month the summer
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh in oftentimes and it it is not
 
01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
allowed in normally traveled portions of
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
the lake so it forces folks to drop
 
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
their anchor close to
 
01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
shore uh our concern uh that we wanted
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
to bring to you is the shorefront
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
property owner Boer conflicts that
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
certainly will increase uh and put
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
demands on our agency uh it is uh
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce with the number of
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
officers that we have
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
statewide um and we we have seen and we
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
do see people who just don't realize
 
01:13:58.629 --> 01:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
that they can't just come and sleep on
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
their boat in New
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our laws do currently allow
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
for sleeping on board your boat if you
 
01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
have a Nexus to Shore and some might
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
carry that forward and and um that means
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
they have access to a toilet but if you
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
are tied to Shore or anchored AB budding
 
01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
a person's property with their
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
permission it is allowed and you also
 
01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
have to report to Dees uh the reason for
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
that is so that if there is a toilet on
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
board and the boat comes from out of
 
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
state they will inspect the Marine
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
sanitation device or the marine toilet
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh Plumbing uh in New Hampshire it is
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
illegal to allow your uh device to be
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
plumbed in such a way that you can
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
discharge overboard it requires you to
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
pump in New Hampshire so those are some
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
of the issues that that we see as an
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
agency that this bill uh May
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
inadvertently create uh with who knows
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
how many people who will now avoid the
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
hotel charge and sleep on their boat on
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
our Lakes happy to answer any questions
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
have start from this side fir
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
first uh yeah representative
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
first thank you for taking my question
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh can you clarify what you just said we
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
currently have a law that allows the
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
toilet facilities to be inspected in
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
this same chapter
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
um a boat that is anchored a budding
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
Shore or uh attached to shore could be a
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
dock or just a a rope to a tree with the
 
01:15:35.629 --> 01:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
owner's permission is allowable if they
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
have contacted Dees to notify them of
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
that practice it's just a phone call or
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
an email to
 
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
Dees um Dees has a statute and and uh
 
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
when you register your boat in New
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you have toilet facilities
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
there's a box that is checked at the
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
time of registration and Dees has people
 
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
that will go around to marinas uh and
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
actually inspect house boats making sure
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
that that uh Black Water gray water
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
can't be discharged overboard the
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
plumbing needs to be disabled uh only
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
facility representative wolf and folks
 
01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
on this side thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
if you're allowed to be on the boat for
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
an indeterminate length of time do you
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
come under the local zoning ordinance as
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
an accessory dwelling unit or what
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
happens in that case I I can't speak
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
directly to that representative uh I do
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
know in some other uh cases involving
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
boats restaurant style boats zoning did
 
01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.550 align:start position:0%
boats restaurant style boats zoning did
not

01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
waters okay representative Darby was
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
there anyone else on his side thank you
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you Captain D Ley again
 
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand how to
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
interpret um the law a little bit here
 
01:17:08.189 --> 01:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
because 20 uh 270 A2 says that um you
 
01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
can uh you are permitted to you know
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
ground or Beach um or tie your boat to
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
shore um overnight if you basically if
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
you own that or if you have the owner's
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
permission um 270 A3 says you can't
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
accept as permitted by
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
2782 um the 2785 says if you're in
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
violation that's where the penalties
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
occur so the I this is a genuine
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
question I don't know how to interpret
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
this law two says you can do this three
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
says you can't do it except as perimed
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
by two and then five says you get
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
penalized if you violate it so is it is
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
it your interpretation that by removing
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh A3 that you could tie to um to shore
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
and you could tie the shore any place
 
01:17:58.750 --> 01:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
because it's it's not permitted that
 
01:18:00.669 --> 01:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
would be my interpretation yes sir okay
 
01:18:00.679 --> 01:18:03.149 align:start position:0%
would be my interpretation yes sir okay
thank

01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
gold uh does this just apply to a house
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
bow which I picture as being sort of
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
with P pontoons and just a square kind
 
01:18:20.669 --> 01:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
of uh structure or does it uh could it
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
apply to a 35 foot
 
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.830 align:start position:0%
apply to a 35 foot
nice

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
nice
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
vote that's an excellent question
 
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative and I can tell you that
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
historically uh the courts at least
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
where we have brought these cases before
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
them um as as uh representative Harve
 
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
Harvey bullia said um the courts have
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
ruled that even a small ski booat with a
 
01:18:44.669 --> 01:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
sleeping bag and a five gallon bucket
 
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
intended for that purpose has been
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
deemed a house boat not all and and to
 
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
be open with you that's not typically
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
what we see at anchor but removing A2
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
certainly opens that as the type of boat
 
01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
that could in addition to the
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
see any no other any other
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none very much thank
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:18.070 align:start position:0%
you for your
time

01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh Tom uh Wally uh
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
presume is a rep I guess representating
 
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
minutes hi
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
my y turn it on okay uh my name is Tom
 
01:19:37.629 --> 01:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
Wally and I'd like to talk in favor of
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
HB 1049 I live in Mont New Hampshire and
 
01:19:43.149 --> 01:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
I have a small 19t house boat that I can
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
trailer to different bodies of water
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
when I got it several years ago I was
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
asked where I want to plan on taking it
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
and I responded I would like to Anchor
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
in a secluded Cove in several lakes near
 
01:19:58.110 --> 01:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
me and that's when I was informed that
 
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire is the only state in
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
the country where it's illegal to spend
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
the night on a boat on inland waterways
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
this came as a surprise to me so I Char
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
started checking around to see if this
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
was true in other states I called Maine
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
inland fisheries and asked them if I
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
could spend the night on the lake in
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
Maine they said no problem as long as
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
they had the correct lights uh anchor
 
01:20:20.669 --> 01:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
lights and I did not anchor in the main
 
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
Channel I also could not tie up on
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
private land but the rest of the lake
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
was public water and there was no
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions I then contacted Vermont
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts New York Connecticut and
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
none of none of them had such laws asked
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
him if they had issues with people
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
spending the night on the boats and they
 
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:41.639 align:start position:0%
said they did not I've taken many
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
overnight trips to seago Lake in Maine
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
and I've only ever seen one other boat
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
moing overnight on that
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
Lake I then looked up the Marine laws in
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
all 50 states is it uh took me quite a
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
while and New Hampshire is the only
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
state that bans overnight stays on the
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
boat I spent days on the Eerie Canal in
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
new New York I have uh gone to lakes in
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
Maine spent times on lake in North
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
Carolina and trailered my boat down to
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
the St John's river river in Florida the
 
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
only state that I can't stay on my boat
 
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
overnight is my own home state of New
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I wanted to find out more
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
a-3 how it came about so I went to the
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
state archives and I looked up notes on
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
the original Hearing in
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
1967 the notes from the hearing stated
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
two reasons for the law to prevent house
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
quotes from being used as living
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
quarters and to prevent pollution waste
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
being thrown
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
overboard so rather than coming up with
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
rules to address these concerns such as
 
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
limits on how many nights you could stay
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
on your boat are designating what type
 
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
of sanitary facilities you had on your
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
boat they just outlawed spending the
 
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
outright as the law stands I can spend
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
the night on my boat in public Waters
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
next to private land if I have
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
permission of the land owner I don't
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
understand how only land owners can give
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
permission for someone using public
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
Waters the waters belong to the people
 
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire not the lakefront
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
property owners as far as pollution is
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
concerned I can stay on my boat
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
overnight with land owners permission if
 
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
I contact the New Hampshire Department
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services and get their
 
01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
permission one time I stayed on Mary
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
meaton Lake because I have a friend who
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
owns property there when I contacted New
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
surfaces they told me what type of I
 
01:22:38.189 --> 01:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
told them what type of toilet I had on
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
my boat and they said it was fine and
 
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
gave me permission almost all boats
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
operating during the day in New
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and inland waterways do not
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
have approved toilets on them so how is
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
my boat with an approved toilet an
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
environmental concern if preventing
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
people from living on a boat in
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
pollution are the reasons for the law it
 
01:22:58.590 --> 01:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
seems there's much better ways to
 
01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
address these concerns than a total
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
ban this is about who and how people can
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
use public Waters they are just that
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
public Waters the state does not prevent
 
01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
the use of public Waters during the day
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
we can't do that because the waters
 
01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
belong to everyone they are our resource
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
and this is what every other state in
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
the country understands the lakes and
 
01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
rivers in New Hampshire are public
 
01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
Waters so why is New Hampshire the LI
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
fre or die State the only state that
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
restricts its residents from using the
 
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
public Waters at night if anyone has any
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
answer any questions by members of the
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%

thank you okay for five minutes so I am
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
here reading this on behalf of a
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
neighbor of mine I do not own a boat he
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
could not make it fortunately um so I'm
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
reading it in his place my name is Sam
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
hinley and I reside at nine Ridgeway
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
road mont Vernon New Hampshire I have
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
been a resident of New Hampshire since
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
2006 and have been the owner of a number
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
of cruising sailboats throughout the
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
time I have lived here I am writing to
 
01:24:28.110 --> 01:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
communicate my support for House Bill
 
01:24:31.709 --> 01:24:31.719 align:start position:0%
1049 I currently own a small trailerable
 
01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
catboat with a Cy cabin suitable for
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
short cruises and overnight stays as
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
well as a larger cruising sailboat that
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
I keep on Coastal waterways when I first
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
bought my catbat to New Hampshire I
 
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
began to research options for weekend
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
trips where my sons and I could spend a
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
night or two aboard in the peace and
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
beauty of one of our state's many
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
navigable inland
 
01:24:59.550 --> 01:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
waterways I became aware of New
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's prohibition of overnight
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
stays during this research and I was
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
surprised and dismayed at this
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
exceptionally restrictive law what I
 
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
also found during this research is that
 
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
the allowable exception to be more to a
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
private lakefront property in practice
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
means that unless you have a personal
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
connection with the landowner you are
 
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
limited to the relatively few private
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
marinas these marinas are sparse or
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
non-existent on smaller Lakes but even
 
01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
on the larger Lakes what I found is that
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
very few have provision for in quote
 
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
transient short-term dockage as well as
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
almost all are full with seasonal
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
renters what this means in practice is
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
that any New Hampshire boat owner
 
01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
wanting to sleep aboard their boat on
 
01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
our inland waterways must commit to a
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
season-long contract with the marina
 
01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
this is both costly and highly
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
restrictive and what it has meant for me
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
and my family is that we have taken our
 
01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
trips out of state to areas where more
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable Waterway management POS with
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
with more reasonable Waterway management
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
policies as far as I aware New Hampshire
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
is the only state with such a blank
 
01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.790 align:start position:0%
is the only state with such a blank
thank

are um and I was wondering about whether
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
the local Hell's Angels decided to grab
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
a bunch of boats put a five gallon
 
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
bucket on it and throw a sleeping bag in
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
it and then Park them all together in
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
the middle of the
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%

02:03:04.270 --> 02:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
committee representative Bixby floor is
 
02:03:06.430 --> 02:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
yours yes thank you for the record I'm
 
02:03:08.589 --> 02:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
representative Peter Bixby from
 
02:03:12.270 --> 02:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
Dover and uh this bill is a request from
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
the Department uh and uh what it
 
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
essentially does is um
 
02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
it create it's uh the geological mapping
 
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
program in
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh hold
 
02:03:32.669 --> 02:03:32.679 align:start position:0%
on wrong thing um the geological mapping
 
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
program in uh the New Hampshire
 
02:03:38.669 --> 02:03:38.679 align:start position:0%
Geological Survey uh is supported by um
 
02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
funds from the uh uh us G Geological
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
Survey and USGS rules require that
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
states have a state mapping advisory
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
committee in order to receive the
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
funding the New Hampshire geological
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
resources advisory committee serves this
 
02:04:00.990 --> 02:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
role now and this is a committee that uh
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
has been going on for a while but it's
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc committee and it needs to be
 
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh revised reauthorized every three
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
years by the governor uh under RSA uh
 
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
21g col 11 uh this bill would uh change
 
02:04:20.910 --> 02:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
it from being an ad hoc committee to
 
02:04:23.709 --> 02:04:23.719 align:start position:0%
being a permanent Committee in statute
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh which will assure ongoing funding and
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh will just simplify the process of not
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
having to have it reauthorized every 3
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
years uh there is a sunset in the bill
 
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
in case Federal funding is terminated
 
02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
and if you uh and that's basically what
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
I know about it so if you have any
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions other than the than about the
 
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh Sunset then I'm going to uh let Miss
 
02:04:51.229 --> 02:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
Mr cheeky take care of
 
02:04:51.239 --> 02:04:54.910 align:start position:0%
Mr cheeky take care of
that

02:04:54.910 --> 02:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.229 --> 02:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative R for a question yes
 
02:05:01.870 --> 02:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair representative I have
 
02:05:06.109 --> 02:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
a question on line two on um page you
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
know page one the bill starts it has
 
02:05:14.549 --> 02:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
amend RSA 12- is that a zero or an O uh
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure oh
 
02:05:20.910 --> 02:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
okay probably probably an O because just
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
because of the structure of uh of our
 
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
you is there any other
 
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.149 --> 02:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
prasy yes don't say don't say easier I'm
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
going to hear about well how come you

Hampshire Geological Survey at the
 
02:06:17.549 --> 02:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services as
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby noted uh we
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
requested this legislation and the
 
02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
02:06:26.510 --> 02:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
fully supports this bill um the New
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Geological Survey we're a unit
 
02:06:30.189 --> 02:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
of the office of the commissioner at
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
Dees uh we receive federal funding each
 
02:06:35.950 --> 02:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
year from the USGS uh United States
 
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
Geological Survey National Cooperative
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
geologic mapping program and that
 
02:06:44.030 --> 02:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
funding supports the compilate the
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
collection of data and production of
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
geologic maps to uh characterize both
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
the surficial geology and Bedrock
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
geology of the State of New Hampshire uh
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
these maps and the data on them not only
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
is used by units throughout the
 
02:07:00.430 --> 02:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental
 
02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
Services uh to support groundwater
 
02:07:05.229 --> 02:07:05.239 align:start position:0%
characterization um and other
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
environmental parameters but it is used
 
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
by Consultants it's used by citizens
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
it's used by the educational Community
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
both the uh K through 12 and uh
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
University communities uh the data
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
supports uh decision making to support
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security emergency management
 
02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
in the aftermath of disaster events
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
specifically related to flooding um so
 
02:07:29.229 --> 02:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
the the maps produced from this data
 
02:07:31.069 --> 02:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
collection supports a wide variety of
 
02:07:33.149 --> 02:07:33.159 align:start position:0%
uses across the state and local
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
governments as well um the the program
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
in federal law does require a a state
 
02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
mapping advisory committee in order to
 
02:07:45.069 --> 02:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
receive the federal money the state
 
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
mapping advisory committee which is
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
specified in federal law means that in
 
02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
order to apply for the Federal grant
 
02:07:54.510 --> 02:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
funds every year we have to have a
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee of stakeholders who represent
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
the users of geologic maps that achieves
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
a cross-section of of those users and
 
02:08:05.470 --> 02:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
those of interest in the maps and the
 
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
data on them to determine the state's
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
mapping priorities where in the state
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to map for a given uh Grant
 
02:08:15.870 --> 02:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
application and to vote on our grant
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
proposals uh for many years uh this has
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
been uh carried out by What's called the
 
02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
geologic resources advisory committee
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
the national Cooperative geologic
 
02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
mapping program has been in effect since
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
1992 and since that time the geologic
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
resources advisory committee has
 
02:08:37.629 --> 02:08:37.639 align:start position:0%
functioned each year in an ad hoc manner
 
02:08:37.639 --> 02:08:38.390 align:start position:0%
functioned each year in an ad hoc manner
in

02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
2021 the Department of Environmental
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
Services started to take a look at gr to
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
take a look at its membership and try to
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
broaden it and to to to make it as
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative as possible of who uses
 
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
our geologic Maps while simultaneously
 
02:08:56.109 --> 02:08:56.119 align:start position:0%
starting to plot out the future of
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
geologic mapping in New Hampshire for
 
02:08:59.229 --> 02:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
the 21st
 
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
century as a result of that process our
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
department legal council reviewed the
 
02:09:06.510 --> 02:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
composition of grck and determined that
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
it was not functioning in uh consistency
 
02:09:13.709 --> 02:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
with RSA 21g section1 as uh
 
02:09:15.629 --> 02:09:15.639 align:start position:0%
representative bixie mentioned which is
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
the state law that governs advisory
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
committees which states that uh advisory
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
committees need to be created by the
 
02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of an agency in
 
02:09:27.669 --> 02:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
consultation with the governor uh which
 
02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
we we completed in 2022 to meet
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
consistency with that state law the
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
state law does also say that a uh
 
02:09:39.549 --> 02:09:39.559 align:start position:0%
advisory committee created has to sunset
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
in three years upon its creation so the
 
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
current rendition of grck now sunsets on
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
June 30th of
 
02:09:51.629 --> 02:09:51.639 align:start position:0%
2025 so we are requesting to put this in
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
statute uh with the membership as
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
identified in the bill uh which is the
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
current membership of gr as established
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner last year uh so that
 
02:10:04.109 --> 02:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
as representative bixie mentioned we can
 
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
continue to receive federal funds each
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
year and have a standing committee that
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
represents the cross-section of users of
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
these Maps across the state both in
 
02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
state government uh University committee
 
02:10:20.669 --> 02:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
uh PRI private sector as well as the
 
02:10:22.950 --> 02:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
representatives of the public uh in
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
order so that we can continue to receive
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
these funds currently we have at a a
 
02:10:31.470 --> 02:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
more detailed scale the 1 to 24,000
 
02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
mapping scale we have approximately
 
02:10:39.069 --> 02:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
67,000 67,000 67% of the state mapped
 
02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
for official geology uh much of Western
 
02:10:43.549 --> 02:10:43.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has not been mapped to
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
this point and we have approximately uh
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
37% of the give you the exact number 23%
 
02:10:55.549 --> 02:10:55.559 align:start position:0%
of the state mapped for Bedrock geology
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
at the one in 24,000 scale and we're
 
02:10:59.950 --> 02:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
looking to move to more populated areas
 
02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
of the state moving forward so the
 
02:11:05.109 --> 02:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
language of House Bill 1060 is
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
consistent with the language that is in
 
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
the federal law which requires us to
 
02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
have a GE State mapping advisory
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
committee which for us is the geologic
 
02:11:17.950 --> 02:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
resource advisory committee and if you
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
look at the federal law um some of the
 
02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
language that it requires of States
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
we've put right in the the bill language
 
02:11:28.830 --> 02:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
which would go into statute so there is
 
02:11:31.549 --> 02:11:31.559 align:start position:0%
consistency there so again the
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services is
 
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
fully supports this bill uh we feel that
 
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
this will uh streamline the process make
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
things easier for us moving forward
 
02:11:43.709 --> 02:11:43.719 align:start position:0%
allow us to continue to receive federal
 
02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
funding and ensure that we are
 
02:11:47.669 --> 02:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
continually consistent with the state
 
02:11:50.589 --> 02:11:50.599 align:start position:0%
law that governs advisory committees and
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
with that we we respectfully request
 
02:11:55.149 --> 02:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
your approval thank
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
you I have any questions from I start go
 
02:12:02.549 --> 02:12:02.559 align:start position:0%
this way this time representative Rong
 
02:12:02.559 --> 02:12:03.629 align:start position:0%
this way this time representative Rong
then

02:12:03.629 --> 02:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:12:05.629 --> 02:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and
 
02:12:08.189 --> 02:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
actually have two one um how successful
 
02:12:13.589 --> 02:12:13.599 align:start position:0%
are you filling these positions on your
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee so currently so there there's
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
basically two broad groupings there's
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
the state agency members and then there
 
02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
are the external members to state
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
government the external members to state
 
02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
government have basically been able to
 
02:12:29.709 --> 02:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
be completely filled we've not had
 
02:12:32.549 --> 02:12:32.559 align:start position:0%
trouble with those on the state agency
 
02:12:34.589 --> 02:12:34.599 align:start position:0%
side we do have a couple vacancies
 
02:12:36.669 --> 02:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
because as I think you're aware there
 
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
been there's been a lot of Shifting in
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
state government there's been open
 
02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
positions so for example the divisional
 
02:12:43.549 --> 02:12:43.559 align:start position:0%
home and Security emergency management
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
seat is currently open uh however with
 
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
this process being completed we will be
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
able to to move forward and fill that
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
position likely with the state haard
 
02:12:57.310 --> 02:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
mitigation officer so by and large we
 
02:12:59.109 --> 02:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
have been able to fill most of these
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
positions okay thank you followup Mr
 
02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:04.119 align:start position:0%
chair follow and then um you mentioned
 
02:13:06.510 --> 02:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
earlier and I should be more aware of
 
02:13:09.030 --> 02:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
more educated on it about that committee
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
bill that's in RSA that limits
 
02:13:13.629 --> 02:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
committees to a three threeyear
 
02:13:18.549 --> 02:13:18.559 align:start position:0%
Sunset um with with this committee still
 
02:13:21.629 --> 02:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
have to follow that sun setting rule or
 
02:13:23.629 --> 02:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
would it need an amendment to make sure
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
it was exempt from that RSA my
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
understanding from our department legal
 
02:13:32.109 --> 02:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
councel is that based on that law
 
02:13:34.229 --> 02:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
without us putting this Committee in
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
statute it sunsets on June 30th 2025
 
02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
which is the three-year Mark after it
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
was created in 2022 that is what our
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
legal councel has
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
said okay so um but with this if this
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
passes then it's exempt from that RSA
 
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
the sunset correct because it will be
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
its own committee like other advisory
 
02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Derby then
 
02:14:05.629 --> 02:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um is I
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
understand the uh the federal um rule
 
02:14:14.589 --> 02:14:14.599 align:start position:0%
federal law um this is you know the
 
02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
geological resource committee per uh or
 
02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
sorry the national Cooperative
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
geological mapping program and in
 
02:14:23.310 --> 02:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
particular the state map this seems to
 
02:14:25.549 --> 02:14:25.559 align:start position:0%
be the state map program that is correct
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
um it it says that the funds have to be
 
02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
matched um the federal funds have to be
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
matched that is correct so these this is
 
02:14:34.270 --> 02:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
these are existing funds you already the
 
02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
the dees already has funds for this
 
02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
mapping process so for it's a 5050 match
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
which means for every Federal dollar we
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
receive we have to match it for a state
 
02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
dollar the state dollar comes from
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
General funded position
 
02:14:53.950 --> 02:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:55.629 align:start position:0%
 
Survey

02:14:55.629 --> 02:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
Survey
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair um
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so I
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
might have missed this in your um
 
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
testimony but um the list of members for
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
the committee including state agencies
 
02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
is this in a direct mirror or who is of
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
who is on the committee on the ad hoc
 
02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:14.709 align:start position:0%
who is on the committee on the ad hoc
committee

02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
yes with with with one addition
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
um and that is that we've added and this
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
was a result of a discussion we had with
 
02:15:26.430 --> 02:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
the current geologic resources advisory
 
02:15:28.870 --> 02:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
committee now we have added a
 
02:15:30.430 --> 02:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
representative of the New Hampshire
 
02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
Association of conservation commissions
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
and we've had conversations with them
 
02:15:37.549 --> 02:15:37.559 align:start position:0%
and they are supportive of that so that
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
will bring in the conservation Community
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
because there are conservation
 
02:15:44.350 --> 02:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
commissions who have used this
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
information thank you that's thank you
 
02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful
 
02:15:50.950 --> 02:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions by members
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee representative Derby
 
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
for a second thank you Mr chair thanks
 
02:15:58.109 --> 02:15:58.119 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question um very
 
02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
similar question to representative Vale
 
02:16:05.069 --> 02:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
um number of these positions have um are
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
nominated by a group and then but it
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
says appointed by the government
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
Governor I'm sorry um and I don't see an
 
02:16:15.390 --> 02:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
expiration term for any of the positions
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and so my
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
question um is how does the process work
 
02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
and um isn't there normally some type of
 
02:16:26.189 --> 02:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
expiration for those types of positions
 
02:16:29.790 --> 02:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um so for this this is for
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
this is our proposal for the design of
 
02:16:34.750 --> 02:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
this committee uh basically it's
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
basically designed to function as gr
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
which was authorized under RSA 21g
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
section 11 currently functions um the
 
02:16:45.469 --> 02:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
amount of money that we receive each
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
year from state map is on a good year we
 
02:16:51.150 --> 02:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
might receive over $100,000 but
 
02:16:54.030 --> 02:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we receive between 60
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
and $100,000 depending on what the
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
proposal is and what the geologic
 
02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
mapping program at the federal level has
 
02:17:03.629 --> 02:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
available so the committee meets once a
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
year um as in reference to your question
 
02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
we are able to fill these
 
02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
positions um but it does require a
 
02:17:15.309 --> 02:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
certain amount of recruiting to be able
 
02:17:17.150 --> 02:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
to have the people to fill these
 
02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:18.469 align:start position:0%
to have the people to fill these
positions

02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
so the idea is that when we have people
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
on there that are representative that
 
02:17:27.629 --> 02:17:27.639 align:start position:0%
allows them to to be there as as long as
 
02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
needed hope that helps
 
02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
yeah any other members of the committee
 
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:17:38.349 --> 02:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
question the chair I just specifically
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
ask uh uh as members of the these
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
committees uh they will the members of
 
02:17:47.950 --> 02:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
the committee they they were they'll
 
02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
serve at the uh uh at the prerogative of
 
02:17:54.270 --> 02:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
the of the
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh of the PE of the of
 
02:18:04.270 --> 02:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
the whoever uh appoints them correct so
 
02:18:06.910 --> 02:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
as this is currently written once a
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
person is appointed this does not
 
02:18:11.070 --> 02:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
currently have a provision for
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily their
 
02:18:14.589 --> 02:18:14.599 align:start position:0%
termination uh
 
02:18:17.669 --> 02:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
basically how gr has historically oper
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
ated because it was ad hoc is that the
 
02:18:24.589 --> 02:18:24.599 align:start position:0%
state geologist would find individuals
 
02:18:27.669 --> 02:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
to try to achieve a cross-section they
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
would serve on gra gr typically meets
 
02:18:31.709 --> 02:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
once a year to discuss mapping
 
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
priorities and approve the annual
 
02:18:34.589 --> 02:18:34.599 align:start position:0%
proposal to
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
USGS they would typically remain on gra
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
as long as they had the interest or as
 
02:18:42.429 --> 02:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
long as they were employed with the
 
02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
current organization they were
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
with that's the history and this and
 
02:18:53.549 --> 02:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
this uh this automat this well this uh
 
02:18:55.790 --> 02:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
committee automatically
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
terminates when the funding stops
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
through the national Cooperative
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
geologic mapping program the US
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
Geological Survey
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
so that it's that's an
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
automatic disappear it automatically
 
02:19:14.110 --> 02:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
disappears or it's no longer functional
 
02:19:16.910 --> 02:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
if if the national Cooperative geologic
 
02:19:20.429 --> 02:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
mapping program either ceased to exist
 
02:19:22.830 --> 02:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
or federal funding was no longer
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
available under the program that is
 
02:19:27.070 --> 02:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
correct right but if the federal funding
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
becomes available under another program
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
you'd have to come back to re to redo
 
02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:33.830 align:start position:0%
you'd have to come back to re to redo
the

02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:36.509 --> 02:19:36.519 align:start position:0%
stat as this is currently written I
 
02:19:38.509 --> 02:19:38.519 align:start position:0%
believe you are
 
02:19:42.429 --> 02:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
correct y when I also notice that you
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
have you do not have any uh uh anyone
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
anyone one from any from the houses of
 
02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:51.349 align:start position:0%
anyone one from any from the houses of
the

02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislature and so that makes it a
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.270 --> 02:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
passing and it is the truth
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:13.950 --> 02:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
much uh question I'll I'll U anyone else
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
have a question anyone else wish to
 
02:20:19.950 --> 02:20:19.960 align:start position:0%

uh we can we we did last week we
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
took how
 
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
was on Executive right
 
02:20:59.469 --> 02:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:03.429 --> 02:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
Call are we all voting in the same
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
direction it's good
 
02:21:09.309 --> 02:21:09.319 align:start position:0%
question all right
 
02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
we but
 
02:21:17.790 --> 02:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
uh yeah both
 
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
we do most of our work by consensus I
 
02:21:23.309 --> 02:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
would like to say pardon we do most of
 
02:21:27.910 --> 02:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
our work by consensus yeah uh so I mean
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
I would ask for just just the straw
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
Brook show a hands who might be
 
02:21:36.190 --> 02:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
interested in who would be for passage
 
02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:38.960 align:start position:0%

go uh who is uh let's see who is the
 
04:00:22.990 --> 04:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill representative rung
 
04:00:28.389 --> 04:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:30.790 --> 04:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:00:32.710 --> 04:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
for the committee members I'm very
 
04:00:35.870 --> 04:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
pleased to introduce House Bill 1103 to
 
04:00:38.910 --> 04:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
you it's actually a very simple bill
 
04:00:41.950 --> 04:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
if you look on page one of the bill um
 
04:00:45.990 --> 04:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's just making a revision to um uh the
 
04:00:48.590 --> 04:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
shorline protection uh water protection
 
04:01:08.309 --> 04:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:10.149 --> 04:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
Department of the violation fails to
 
04:01:12.510 --> 04:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
make a good faith effort at remediation
 
04:01:12.520 --> 04:01:13.469 align:start position:0%
make a good faith effort at remediation
and

04:01:13.469 --> 04:01:13.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:16.030 --> 04:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
restoration um what people uh
 
04:01:18.469 --> 04:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
stakeholders around lakes in New
 
04:01:20.590 --> 04:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and other waterways have
 
04:01:22.670 --> 04:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
noticed um since the shoreline
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
protection act this this ver this uh
 
04:01:28.590 --> 04:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
statute was passed is that it's almost
 
04:01:31.630 --> 04:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
impossible for Dees to enforce it
 
04:01:34.910 --> 04:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
because to demon it's one thing to be
 
04:01:37.389 --> 04:01:37.399 align:start position:0%
able to demonstrate that a violation has
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
occurred but it's nearly impossible to
 
04:01:43.830 --> 04:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
um pinpoint damage to a Waterway based
 
04:01:46.830 --> 04:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
on that one specific violation and I'll
 
04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
give you an example suppose someone
 
04:01:53.710 --> 04:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
clearcuts all of the trees in in the
 
04:01:55.870 --> 04:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
vegetation um in front of their
 
04:01:58.030 --> 04:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
waterfront that's within that Shoreline
 
04:02:00.910 --> 04:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
protection Zone that's going to cause
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
damage to the lake or river eventually
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
because it's going to encourage runoff
 
04:02:08.429 --> 04:02:08.439 align:start position:0%
it's going to encourage erosion which is
 
04:02:10.790 --> 04:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
thus going to allow more nutrients to go
 
04:02:14.070 --> 04:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
into the lake that may spur CYO bacteria
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
blooms or other other alile blooms or
 
04:02:21.070 --> 04:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
just really impact the water quality um
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
and so that may take years for that to
 
04:02:26.510 --> 04:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
observe and by then it's really
 
04:02:28.189 --> 04:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
difficult to say oh it was because of
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
this one action and also damage to
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
waterways are cumulative
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
so damage could be significant not just
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
from that violation but from other
 
04:02:41.389 --> 04:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
violations too so by simplifying the
 
04:02:44.429 --> 04:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
statute to just require that a violation
 
04:02:47.110 --> 04:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
has occurred in order for Dees to be
 
04:02:49.510 --> 04:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
able to enforce we go a long way to
 
04:02:51.790 --> 04:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
protecting the water quality of our
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers um it's I I kind of um
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
compare it to any one of us I won't
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
mention anyone in particular but any one
 
04:03:04.269 --> 04:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
of us who may get stopped for driving
 
04:03:05.670 --> 04:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
over the speed
 
04:03:08.750 --> 04:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
limit um we don't we can't just say to
 
04:03:10.429 --> 04:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
the officer I didn't know what the speed
 
04:03:12.830 --> 04:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
limit was I didn't look at the sign or
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
I'm unaware of any damage or risk that
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
speeding might occur we just get a
 
04:03:20.710 --> 04:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
notice of violation and we have the
 
04:03:23.110 --> 04:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
consequences of that action well we
 
04:03:26.590 --> 04:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
should apply that same level of of
 
04:03:29.950 --> 04:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
action and enforcement to the protection
 
04:03:33.149 --> 04:03:33.159 align:start position:0%
of our waterways as well as our roadways
 
04:03:35.070 --> 04:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
so I would be happy to entertain any
 
04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
questions you
 
04:03:37.080 --> 04:03:39.830 align:start position:0%
questions you
have

04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:03:43.469 --> 04:03:43.479 align:start position:0%
any questions by represent
 
04:03:47.070 --> 04:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
representative yes okay thank you uh for
 
04:03:51.389 --> 04:03:51.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question um now would this be
 
04:03:53.790 --> 04:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
a person cuts the trees for example
 
04:03:57.309 --> 04:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
would they get the violation then right
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
away they would be noticed for
 
04:04:01.750 --> 04:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
committing the violation but under
 
04:04:03.950 --> 04:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
current statute the dees still has
 
04:04:07.349 --> 04:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
leeway on what they can do um you know
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they might take that violation as
 
04:04:12.630 --> 04:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to educate the Violator
 
04:04:14.910 --> 04:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
um but it could be that they may assess
 
04:04:17.469 --> 04:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
the damage and that's been caused and
 
04:04:20.349 --> 04:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
and initi and issue a violation that may
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
be heard in Superior Court with a fine
 
04:04:25.750 --> 04:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
that for a followup yes uh but how does
 
04:04:30.870 --> 04:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
that fit in with this I don't quite
 
04:04:32.389 --> 04:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
understand well so for this
 
04:04:35.870 --> 04:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative gold is that for Dees to
 
04:04:38.189 --> 04:04:38.199 align:start position:0%
enforce the shoreline protection act
 
04:04:40.429 --> 04:04:40.439 align:start position:0%
they not only have to show that a
 
04:04:42.030 --> 04:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
violation has occurred because that's
 
04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward but they also
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
have to show that that violation damaged
 
04:04:48.670 --> 04:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
the Waterway if you if you look on line
 
04:04:50.790 --> 04:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
three of the bill it says in damaging
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
the public
 
04:04:55.110 --> 04:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
Waterway and they continue to violate it
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
and that's where it gets really
 
04:05:04.630 --> 04:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:07.510 --> 04:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
but anyone question by anyone else on
 
04:05:10.149 --> 04:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
the board on the
 
04:05:13.269 --> 04:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
committee um thank you Mr chair I just
 
04:05:15.030 --> 04:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
want to find out if somebody's from Dees
 
04:05:18.349 --> 04:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
is going to be testifying following you
 
04:05:23.269 --> 04:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I do believe we have here and
 
04:05:27.870 --> 04:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
we speaker right after and uh represent
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
I think we also um received a letter
 
04:05:33.070 --> 04:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
from Dees in support of the bill and um
 
04:05:35.469 --> 04:05:35.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chair as I spoke to you earlier um I
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
do want to read um some test testimony
 
04:05:40.349 --> 04:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
that was sent to representative McDonald
 
04:05:42.189 --> 04:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
in wolfboro he asked if I could read it
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
into the record it's from um Linda
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
Murray who is a selectman in wolfboro
 
04:05:51.189 --> 04:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
and she writes as one selectman and a
 
04:05:53.229 --> 04:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
member of the wolfboro waters committee
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
I am in support of HB 1103 the shoreline
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
protection act enforcement this
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
legislation will Aid towns in making it
 
04:06:03.389 --> 04:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
clear that the shorland protection act
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
can be enforced with a consequence
 
04:06:08.429 --> 04:06:08.439 align:start position:0%
having legislation to protect the Lakes
 
04:06:10.469 --> 04:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
will be a plus for all citizens of the
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire since the State
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
lakes are key assets that help Drive the
 
04:06:14.880 --> 04:06:18.990 align:start position:0%
lakes are key assets that help Drive the
state's

04:06:18.990 --> 04:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:21.309 --> 04:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
economy representative G for another
 
04:06:24.110 --> 04:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you uh I noticed in
 
04:06:26.990 --> 04:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
reading this it's
 
04:06:30.189 --> 04:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
uh on the last page of this paper that
 
04:06:33.389 --> 04:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
we have of the bill it says uh or a
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
scope of violations that may be
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
committed by
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities so uh and then
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities is in the next line also
 
04:06:47.510 --> 04:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
so is this different from a ordinary
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
citizen cutting down trees for example
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative are you on the
 
04:06:55.269 --> 04:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
financial yeah the very yeah at the very
 
04:07:06.269 --> 04:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
yeah oh
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
I DS could probably comment more on this
 
04:07:14.070 --> 04:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
but there are several municipalities who
 
04:07:16.309 --> 04:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
have adopted the shoreline protection
 
04:07:19.950 --> 04:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
act is part of their ordinance so they
 
04:07:22.750 --> 04:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
have the power to enforce that ordinance
 
04:07:25.389 --> 04:07:25.399 align:start position:0%
and and they couldn't they could do it
 
04:07:27.389 --> 04:07:27.399 align:start position:0%
just on a violation without having to
 
04:07:30.109 --> 04:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
demonstrate direct damage and then they
 
04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:38.429 --> 04:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
themselves is there anyone else on the
 
04:07:41.670 --> 04:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
on the committee who has a a question if
 
04:07:44.109 --> 04:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
not okay thank you very
 
04:07:44.119 --> 04:07:48.149 align:start position:0%
not okay thank you very
much

04:07:48.149 --> 04:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:53.149 --> 04:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
and I'll next call Darlene for from
 
04:07:55.070 --> 04:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
representing the Hampshire Department of
 
04:07:55.080 --> 04:08:06.630 align:start position:0%
representing the Hampshire Department of
Environmental

04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
Services good afternoon my name is
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
Darlene Forest I'm the Wetland Bureau
 
04:08:12.030 --> 04:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
administrator at the New Hampshire
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services we
 
04:08:17.149 --> 04:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
have already circulated our we have both
 
04:08:19.269 --> 04:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
emailed and circulated hard copies of
 
04:08:21.790 --> 04:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
our written testimony the Department of
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services does support this
 
04:08:26.349 --> 04:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not going to bother to read
 
04:08:27.990 --> 04:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
this letter as we've already provided it
 
04:08:28.000 --> 04:08:28.790 align:start position:0%
this letter as we've already provided it
to

04:08:28.790 --> 04:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
you so to build upon the comments that
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
were already offered or the testimony
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
that was already offered the shorland
 
04:08:38.349 --> 04:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
protection act in the way the department
 
04:08:39.870 --> 04:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
chooses to enforce the Shoreland
 
04:08:43.149 --> 04:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
protection act our charge is
 
04:08:45.870 --> 04:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
Environmental Quality so our first
 
04:08:47.550 --> 04:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
priority anytime we have an
 
04:08:50.070 --> 04:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
environmental violation regardless of
 
04:08:52.830 --> 04:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
program is to attempt to have
 
04:08:54.349 --> 04:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
environmental corrective measures
 
04:08:56.109 --> 04:08:56.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's the replanting of trees the
 
04:08:58.910 --> 04:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
treatment of storm water remediation is
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
our first goal however there are times
 
04:09:03.109 --> 04:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
when damage is
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
irreparable or where an individual
 
04:09:11.070 --> 04:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
simply does not want to participate in
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
that restoration or remediation process
 
04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
or whatever reason that may be without
 
04:09:21.630 --> 04:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
the ability to impose a fine we don't
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
have any
 
04:09:26.830 --> 04:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
other method of encouraging someone to
 
04:09:29.950 --> 04:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
work with us and where something is
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
irreparable then there is no penalty and
 
04:09:34.830 --> 04:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
the truth of the matter is there are
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
times when someone comes in and
 
04:09:41.429 --> 04:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely devastates a site that will
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
take a century or so to repair if you
 
04:09:44.640 --> 04:09:46.070 align:start position:0%
take a century or so to repair if you
cut

04:09:46.070 --> 04:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
cut
 
04:09:50.149 --> 04:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
down you know 7500 year old trees you
 
04:09:52.109 --> 04:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
cannot bring those in in the back of a
 
04:09:54.910 --> 04:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
of a truck they you do not ever recreate
 
04:09:56.429 --> 04:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
what you've
 
04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
lost so there has to be some ability for
 
04:10:03.590 --> 04:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
us to exert some kind of Leverage it is
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
not our first
 
04:10:09.910 --> 04:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
choice when in 2008 when the Act was
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
redrafted the language that we have here
 
04:10:15.149 --> 04:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
is essentially that first line it is
 
04:10:17.790 --> 04:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
very similar to every other compliance
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
line that we have in every other statute
 
04:10:22.990 --> 04:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
when someone violates the law we have
 
04:10:25.229 --> 04:10:25.239 align:start position:0%
the option of imposing a financial
 
04:10:28.189 --> 04:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
penalty for that
 
04:10:31.149 --> 04:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
violation it used to say it was an
 
04:10:33.309 --> 04:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
additional violation for each additional
 
04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
day we are not asking you we are not
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging that at this time at this
 
04:10:41.109 --> 04:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
time we would be happy just to be able
 
04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
to find when this language was changed
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
in 2010 2011 the two caveats that we've
 
04:10:51.109 --> 04:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
asked to remove those were added and
 
04:10:53.830 --> 04:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
those two caveats the first is for us to
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
impose a violation we need to show that
 
04:10:58.710 --> 04:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
that particular violation on that
 
04:11:01.229 --> 04:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
particular lot degraded the water for
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
the entire protected water body so if
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
you can imagine on Lake wiip pasak
 
04:11:09.910 --> 04:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
what you would need to do on a singular
 
04:11:12.030 --> 04:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
lot to show that that singular lot
 
04:11:15.550 --> 04:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
degraded the water quality of all of
 
04:11:19.229 --> 04:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
winaki that is an impossible task the
 
04:11:21.030 --> 04:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
second part of this
 
04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
is if there is a failure to make a good
 
04:11:27.790 --> 04:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
faith effort by The Violator to
 
04:11:30.269 --> 04:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
remediate good faith effort that's an
 
04:11:33.710 --> 04:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
indication that we have to prove state
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
of mind um in order for us to say you
 
04:11:38.590 --> 04:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
didn't do this in good faith you have to
 
04:11:41.830 --> 04:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
have a significant level of evidence
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
that despite what the person put forward
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
either they didn't intend to do it or
 
04:11:49.630 --> 04:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
they know perfectly well it won't
 
04:11:51.630 --> 04:11:51.640 align:start position:0%
succeed or that it won't make up for
 
04:11:55.510 --> 04:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
what was lost to give you an example of
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh how this might work or what we've
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
encountered in the past our first this
 
04:12:04.389 --> 04:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
coming to our awareness how difficult
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
this became we had an individual who was
 
04:12:10.630 --> 04:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
a developer who was on their third
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
violation on
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
winaki you would think by the third
 
04:12:14.840 --> 04:12:16.429 align:start position:0%
winaki you would think by the third
violation

04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
violation
 
04:12:19.309 --> 04:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
for elimination of the Waterfront buffer
 
04:12:22.590 --> 04:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
that that would be an easy find we we
 
04:12:25.070 --> 04:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
could not find because after clearing
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
the Waterfront buffer they came back and
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
offered to plant single digits of
 
04:12:33.950 --> 04:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
blueberry bushes that was considered by
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
the attorneys as a good faith for
 
04:12:38.830 --> 04:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
mediation effort and thus despite having
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
a a prior history and despite someone
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
who as a commercial Enterprise Who
 
04:12:47.309 --> 04:12:47.319 align:start position:0%
develops properties and an expectation
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
that they should have known the law
 
04:12:51.670 --> 04:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
simply offering a few replanting having
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
removed the ground cover and the
 
04:12:57.790 --> 04:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
trees eliminated our ability to actually
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
impose any other penalties and if we
 
04:13:03.109 --> 04:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
have no ability to impose any other
 
04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
Financial penalties then he has no
 
04:13:08.269 --> 04:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
reason to actually make an honest
 
04:13:10.229 --> 04:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
attempt to replant that
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
buffer and along those lines the way
 
04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
that we often would use a fine is we can
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
propose a fine and hold it in a bance
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
until such time as restoration is
 
04:13:24.149 --> 04:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
complete again this isn't like we're
 
04:13:27.269 --> 04:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
looking and and our fines don't go into
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
our budget we do not use fines because
 
04:13:34.990 --> 04:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
we want to take in income or because we
 
04:13:38.550 --> 04:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
just like finding people for us a f is a
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
tool to encourage restoration good
 
04:13:46.670 --> 04:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
actual meaningful
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
restoration um if you have any questions
 
04:13:53.309 --> 04:13:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:59.429 --> 04:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:07.269 --> 04:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
clerk thank you m thank you Mr chair I
 
04:14:09.149 --> 04:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
just uh was wondering uh Miss Forest if
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
you could give us maybe one or two more
 
04:14:14.830 --> 04:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
examples of this if you have them the
 
04:14:18.510 --> 04:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
more the better just to to illustrate uh
 
04:14:20.950 --> 04:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
the problems that that you've
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
encountered with the the vagueness of
 
04:14:26.030 --> 04:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
the law that would be helpful thank
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
you we have a couple that are Active
 
04:14:31.030 --> 04:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
cases that I will refrain from
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
using um if I may I would be happy to
 
04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
actually provide photographs I can go
 
04:14:38.830 --> 04:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
back to the office in a certain number
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
of days I can provide the committee with
 
04:14:43.389 --> 04:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
photographs and examples of areas where
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
we would have liked to have find someone
 
04:14:48.269 --> 04:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
but the option was not
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:55.590 --> 04:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
you that answer your
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
question represent representative LoveIt
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
for a question how how thank you for
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question how how many feet
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
from the shoreline would this act
 
04:15:11.830 --> 04:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
pertain to 50 how about a
 
04:15:15.149 --> 04:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
river or protected Waters which would be
 
04:15:16.950 --> 04:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
lakes and ponds greater than 10 acres in
 
04:15:20.349 --> 04:15:20.359 align:start position:0%
size tidal waters rivers that are either
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
designated under the designated Rivers
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
program or we use the fourth order of
 
04:15:27.269 --> 04:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
the staer method so it's main stem
 
04:15:29.469 --> 04:15:29.479 align:start position:0%
streams not your

Headwaters for those water bodies that
 
04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
are protected that's our jurisdictional
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
areas it is areas Within 250t F feet so
 
04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
if you violate one of the minimum
 
04:15:42.269 --> 04:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
standards of the Shoreland protection
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%

04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
vegetated buffers by law within 150 ft
 
04:15:57.389 --> 04:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
so that is further reduced use of
 
04:16:00.510 --> 04:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
herbicides or pesticides without proper
 
04:16:03.670 --> 04:16:03.680 align:start position:0%

04:16:08.229 --> 04:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
are SE IC Systems without permits we
 
04:16:10.830 --> 04:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
could also um we would normally defer
 
04:16:12.510 --> 04:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
the subsurface but that is something we
 
04:16:14.670 --> 04:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
could also do as well as failure to
 
04:16:16.710 --> 04:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
maintain citation erosion controls
 
04:16:16.720 --> 04:16:17.630 align:start position:0%

leading
 
04:16:20.429 --> 04:16:20.439 align:start position:0%
to um things of that nature so those are
 
04:16:21.910 --> 04:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
the specific
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%

04:16:44.070 --> 04:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative har for a question thank
 
04:16:46.269 --> 04:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
question I'm having a hard time
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
following the actual bill and how it
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
impacts you um the bill I'm looking at
 
04:16:56.910 --> 04:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
only Strikes Out basically notification
 
04:17:01.710 --> 04:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
to the person that created this damage
 
04:17:04.990 --> 04:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
and asked them to remediate so is the
 
04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
notification provision which is holding
 
04:17:10.469 --> 04:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
you back so you don't want to
 
04:17:14.189 --> 04:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
notify um no it is the the first phrase
 
04:17:16.590 --> 04:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
and damaging the public Waterway so they
 
04:17:17.950 --> 04:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
actually have to damage the public
 
04:17:19.630 --> 04:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
waterway that is what I mentioned about
 
04:17:21.469 --> 04:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
we must prove that that particular
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
violation on that particular site had a
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
measurable impact damaging impact on the
 
04:17:30.830 --> 04:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
Waterway who then after notification by
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
the department fails to make a good
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
faith effort so the first part of this
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
is the damaging the public Waterway
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
proof of damage of the public Waterway
 
04:17:40.950 --> 04:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
the second is once we've notified them
 
04:17:42.189 --> 04:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
did they or did they not make a
 
04:17:44.429 --> 04:17:44.439 align:start position:0%
goodfaith effort so how do we prove that
 
04:17:47.790 --> 04:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
the effort that they made was in good
 
04:17:51.429 --> 04:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
faith or not which is proving state of
 
04:17:55.269 --> 04:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
mind we followup so if we take this out
 
04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
and you have other Provisions in your
 
04:17:58.990 --> 04:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
letter it says you have other Provisions
 
04:18:01.750 --> 04:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
to enforce it would the violators still
 
04:18:03.309 --> 04:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
get a notice from
 
04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
you oh we'll still notify yes we have to
 
04:18:07.630 --> 04:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
contact the vi or first thing we're
 
04:18:10.109 --> 04:18:10.119 align:start position:0%
going to contact the Violator of is we
 
04:18:12.990 --> 04:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
have evidence that a violation may have
 
04:18:14.510 --> 04:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
occurred that we are going to
 
04:18:16.750 --> 04:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
investigate we will then notify them of
 
04:18:18.750 --> 04:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
our findings with a request for
 
04:18:21.750 --> 04:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
corrective actions we don't normally ask
 
04:18:24.630 --> 04:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
for a fine until we've exhausted those
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
other options which means we've had
 
04:18:29.870 --> 04:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
consistent back and forth communication
 
04:18:31.469 --> 04:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
Beyond just a simple
 
04:18:33.910 --> 04:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
notification okay thank
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
you representative har
 
04:18:39.550 --> 04:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um one other question if
 
04:18:43.469 --> 04:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
you may uh um so in the case where uh
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
you were just mentioning spray of
 
04:18:48.510 --> 04:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
pesticides is that how does that work
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
how do you find for damages you go and
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
you uh suspect somebody of spraying and
 
04:18:57.870 --> 04:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
then you test the water um have you been
 
04:19:01.109 --> 04:19:01.119 align:start position:0%
able to Pro not prosecute someone for
 
04:19:03.429 --> 04:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
that sure so I mentioned pesticides
 
04:19:05.070 --> 04:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
because it is actually one of the things
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
that's very specifically listed in the
 
04:19:08.790 --> 04:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
law but I can tell you that I've been
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
working in Shoreland since 1998 and we
 
04:19:13.510 --> 04:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
have never successfully pursued a
 
04:19:17.070 --> 04:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
chemical pesticide or fertilizer
 
04:19:19.950 --> 04:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
violation um and the reason for that is
 
04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
because of the level of evidence
 
04:19:23.510 --> 04:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
required you have to catch them in the
 
04:19:26.750 --> 04:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
ACT that's what I so yes you absolutely
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
have to catch them in the act and I I
 
04:19:31.910 --> 04:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
would say this if the day we actually
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
catch a pesticide or chemical fertilizer
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
professional in the act
 
04:19:39.229 --> 04:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
if and there are Provisions that they
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
can do so with a permit but if we catch
 
04:19:42.670 --> 04:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
them violating as a
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
professional that's irreparable you
 
04:19:46.830 --> 04:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
can't take those chemicals back once
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
you've applied them that's a provision
 
04:19:54.830 --> 04:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
on representative Derby thank you Mr
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:20:02.189 --> 04:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
um you said that you could provide some
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
photos or some examples for
 
04:20:06.109 --> 04:20:06.119 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey buia I was
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
wondering if you is with those examples
 
04:20:11.510 --> 04:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
you could um provide examples of where
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
you've been able to negotiate with the
 
04:20:16.109 --> 04:20:16.119 align:start position:0%
people with the property owners um and
 
04:20:19.030 --> 04:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
you haven't they've been by what I'm
 
04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
trying to say
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
is you've found that there's been a
 
04:20:23.429 --> 04:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
violation and they've been willing to
 
04:20:24.670 --> 04:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
work with you and it wouldn't have
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
resulted in a
 
04:20:28.510 --> 04:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
find oh those are the easy ones okay
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yes thank
 
04:20:33.670 --> 04:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
you we can we can we can provide you
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
with a few examples of various
 
04:20:37.199 --> 04:20:40.269 align:start position:0%
with a few examples of various
outcomes

04:20:40.269 --> 04:20:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:43.149 --> 04:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative veale for a for a
 
04:20:45.630 --> 04:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
04:20:48.189 --> 04:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I just wanted
 
04:20:50.469 --> 04:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
to go over what says the assumes that
 
04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
since the Department's already required
 
04:20:54.510 --> 04:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
to investigate this is in the I'm sorry
 
04:20:57.710 --> 04:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the fiscal
 
04:21:02.349 --> 04:21:02.359 align:start position:0%
note such violations pursuant to RSA 43-
 
04:21:02.359 --> 04:21:03.269 align:start position:0%
note such violations pursuant to RSA 43-
B

04:21:03.269 --> 04:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
B
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
co5 one I would there would there for be
 
04:21:12.750 --> 04:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:15.109 --> 04:21:15.119 align:start position:0%
workload so this won't cause more of a
 
04:21:17.910 --> 04:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
workload no we already have a violation
 
04:21:19.830 --> 04:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
we're already pursuing it in attempting
 
04:21:22.830 --> 04:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
to get rediation so this is this would
 
04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
not actually increase our workload
 
04:21:28.990 --> 04:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever thank you for taking my
 
04:21:31.870 --> 04:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
question anyone
 
04:21:31.880 --> 04:21:33.790 align:start position:0%
question anyone
else

04:21:33.790 --> 04:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
ltina ltin for question
 
04:21:38.399 --> 04:21:39.910 align:start position:0%
ltina ltin for question
um

04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
me um I'm wondering about what the scale
 
04:21:48.429 --> 04:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
of the fines are and say you were to
 
04:21:49.950 --> 04:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
find someone
 
04:21:52.750 --> 04:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
for clear cutting the land right down to
 
04:21:55.870 --> 04:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
the Waterfront is it enough of a
 
04:21:58.590 --> 04:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
deterrent for them not to just consider
 
04:22:01.710 --> 04:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
that an expense they're willing to
 
04:22:04.469 --> 04:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
overlook when they're perhaps developing
 
04:22:09.109 --> 04:22:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:11.590 --> 04:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
um well speaking of the fact that it's
 
04:22:13.149 --> 04:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
hard for us to prove state of mind it's
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
always hard for us to determine just
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
what is a deterrent for one individual
 
04:22:20.389 --> 04:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
compared to another
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
um simply removing this
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
provision a single violation so if they
 
04:22:30.189 --> 04:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
only cut the Waterfront buffer that is a
 
04:22:32.510 --> 04:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
single violation of the ACT if they
 
04:22:36.030 --> 04:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
violated multiple Provisions it's $5,000
 
04:22:38.189 --> 04:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
per provision violated because it's not
 
04:22:40.750 --> 04:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
a day on it's not a day over day any
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
are there are approximately
 
04:22:52.790 --> 04:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
eight minimum standards that are in the
 
04:22:55.030 --> 04:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
law if someone managed to violate all
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
eight of them at the same time that
 
04:22:58.590 --> 04:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
ambitious you would have potential for
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
40,000 total and
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:07.229 align:start position:0%
40,000 total and
penalties

04:23:07.229 --> 04:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
if you're a small homeowner on a small
 
04:23:14.349 --> 04:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
pond or on a river that very much
 
04:23:18.189 --> 04:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
hurts um if you're paying two million
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
bucks to buy a piece of property so that
 
04:23:21.990 --> 04:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
you can tear down the residence that's
 
04:23:24.630 --> 04:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
on it and build a new
 
04:23:27.830 --> 04:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
one that might not cover
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
your your yeah it might not be a big
 
04:23:35.070 --> 04:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
deal but it that totally depends on the
 
04:23:37.429 --> 04:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the individ idual
 
04:23:37.439 --> 04:23:39.870 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the individ idual
involved

04:23:39.870 --> 04:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
involved
 
04:23:42.269 --> 04:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
um perhaps that's a conversation for a
 
04:23:42.279 --> 04:23:47.670 align:start position:0%
um perhaps that's a conversation for a
different

04:23:47.670 --> 04:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
day thank you Mr
 
04:23:52.469 --> 04:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:23:56.830 --> 04:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
question um would
 
04:24:00.429 --> 04:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
this speed up the
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
remediation I'm talking about specific
 
04:24:06.269 --> 04:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
examples where you people have not been
 
04:24:06.279 --> 04:24:07.630 align:start position:0%
examples where you people have not been
able

04:24:07.630 --> 04:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
able
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
to get action we believe that this would
 
04:24:14.670 --> 04:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
speed up remediation because we could in
 
04:24:16.030 --> 04:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
fact state
 
04:24:18.790 --> 04:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
that if you do not work with us on
 
04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
compliance and we cannot reach an
 
04:24:26.429 --> 04:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
an acceptable outcome we will begin
 
04:24:30.149 --> 04:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
imposing fines uh it it gives us
 
04:24:33.189 --> 04:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
leverage um again it's a stick we'd
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
rather not use but unfortunately
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:46.229 --> 04:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you Jer has a question uh
 
04:24:49.070 --> 04:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
is I mean it looks like
 
04:24:52.510 --> 04:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
you're this looks like uh you're we're
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
changing the law to really a strict
 
04:24:59.830 --> 04:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
liability uh you did it you're in other
 
04:25:02.910 --> 04:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
words You' you've done the deed and so
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
you're guilty because you did you did
 
04:25:06.670 --> 04:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
the deed
 
04:25:09.429 --> 04:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
not because not because of
 
04:25:12.910 --> 04:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
your uh your mental state or because of
 
04:25:12.920 --> 04:25:14.469 align:start position:0%
your uh your mental state or because of
your

04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:25:18.950 --> 04:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
intent uh is that what you what that is
 
04:25:21.870 --> 04:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
that what you're focusing on to use the
 
04:25:24.030 --> 04:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
rong's prior analogy if you were
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
speeding because you were doing 50 and a
 
04:25:32.750 --> 04:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
35 but you didn't realize the speed
 
04:25:34.630 --> 04:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
limit was
 
04:25:37.149 --> 04:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
35 it's the same same idea so yet the
 
04:25:40.870 --> 04:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
answer is yes however again our intent
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
is not so much that we want to use this
 
04:25:46.030 --> 04:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
all of the time but we don't want we'd
 
04:25:47.670 --> 04:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
like to have it in our tool box we're
 
04:25:50.229 --> 04:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
not asking that they're mandatory F but
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
we are asking for having this tool back
 
04:25:55.229 --> 04:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
in our toolbox if in fact someone comes
 
04:25:58.469 --> 04:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
to us and says I had no idea and they're
 
04:26:01.189 --> 04:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
making they are trying to remediate and
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
they put it they do everything they can
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
to restore the situation to an
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
environmentally stable situation that
 
04:26:07.199 --> 04:26:08.670 align:start position:0%
environmentally stable situation that
will

04:26:08.670 --> 04:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:26:11.109 --> 04:26:11.119 align:start position:0%
recover that's what's most important to
 
04:26:13.630 --> 04:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
us so from a strict liability yes if you
 
04:26:16.590 --> 04:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
did it it's your property or you did it
 
04:26:18.990 --> 04:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
and you were hired to do it and you you
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
still did it either one of those
 
04:26:24.389 --> 04:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
situations if you committed the ACT you
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
are a potential candidate to receive a
 
04:26:29.149 --> 04:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
fine a financial
 
04:26:32.109 --> 04:26:32.119 align:start position:0%
penalty but uh we're not asking for
 
04:26:33.790 --> 04:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
language where it's mandatory we're
 
04:26:35.550 --> 04:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
asking again just to have the tool
 
04:26:35.560 --> 04:26:38.389 align:start position:0%
asking again just to have the tool
available

04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:41.229 --> 04:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
okay anyone
 
04:26:44.790 --> 04:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
else seeing no one else thank you very
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
much I will be here throughout if
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:51.080 --> 04:26:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
question

04:26:54.630 --> 04:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:03.710 --> 04:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
Holland in opposition to the bill
 
04:27:10.070 --> 04:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for giving me
 
04:27:13.590 --> 04:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity my name is Sarah Holland
 
04:27:15.870 --> 04:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
I'm a real estate agent and I'm also the
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
vice chair of the public policy
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
Committee of the New Hampshire
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors and I'm here
 
04:27:22.189 --> 04:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
representing the Realtors as we have
 
04:27:25.990 --> 04:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill um Realtors know
 
04:27:28.030 --> 04:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
that obviously properties on clean and
 
04:27:29.550 --> 04:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
well-managed lakes and rivers are more
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
attractive to buyers and Property Owners
 
04:27:33.469 --> 04:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
by protecting views recreational
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities and overall quality of
 
04:27:35.680 --> 04:27:36.630 align:start position:0%
opportunities and overall quality of
life

04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
life
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
however removing this these items at the
 
04:27:43.790 --> 04:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
beginning of this I feel do not achieve
 
04:27:46.149 --> 04:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
what Dees is looking for and as
 
04:27:50.269 --> 04:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
representative harb had mentioned um the
 
04:27:53.349 --> 04:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
notification piece is important um the
 
04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
sherland um protection act plays a very
 
04:27:59.149 --> 04:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
important role in advancing the goals of
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
Dees however the bill appears to remove
 
04:28:04.349 --> 04:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
the option for them to notify the
 
04:28:06.309 --> 04:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
property owners as they in viation of
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
the statute and give them the
 
04:28:09.950 --> 04:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to correct um although
 
04:28:12.070 --> 04:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
stated by the sponsors um we find it
 
04:28:14.229 --> 04:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
unclear that Dees retains the right to
 
04:28:17.630 --> 04:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
educate and provide a warning because
 
04:28:20.309 --> 04:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
not all um violations of the Shoreland
 
04:28:23.550 --> 04:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
protection act are willful um Property
 
04:28:25.790 --> 04:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
Owners simply make mistakes or are
 
04:28:28.429 --> 04:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
ignorant um of some parts of the act and
 
04:28:30.990 --> 04:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
as we know the act itself does change
 
04:28:34.990 --> 04:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
over time so keeping up with that um can
 
04:28:38.710 --> 04:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
be um may not be top of mind for a
 
04:28:40.670 --> 04:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
number of property owners especially new
 
04:28:43.309 --> 04:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
waterfront property owners and as stated
 
04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
before Shoreland protection extends 250
 
04:28:51.269 --> 04:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
ft um so that is a decent distance from
 
04:28:53.469 --> 04:28:53.479 align:start position:0%
the Waterfront so folks may not even
 
04:28:55.790 --> 04:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
realize they fall under that protection
 
04:28:58.349 --> 04:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
act so we Rec recognize that some
 
04:29:00.670 --> 04:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
Property Owners May willfully violate
 
04:29:02.389 --> 04:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
provisions of the Shoreland act I was
 
04:29:04.950 --> 04:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
actually on a tour with Dees on Lake
 
04:29:08.109 --> 04:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
Winn basaki and saw some of those um
 
04:29:08.119 --> 04:29:10.630 align:start position:0%
Winn basaki and saw some of those um
violations

04:29:10.630 --> 04:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
violations
 
04:29:14.229 --> 04:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
um but Dees may feel that a fine must be
 
04:29:17.750 --> 04:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
imposed and we agree that that's the
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
case um however notification to span
 
04:29:28.429 --> 04:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:31.950 --> 04:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
um relative to the removal the language
 
04:29:33.870 --> 04:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
of the bill there are three parts that
 
04:29:35.950 --> 04:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
are really being removed the first first
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
is the damage to Waterway threshold the
 
04:29:40.750 --> 04:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
second is notification and then the
 
04:29:43.469 --> 04:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
third is good faith effort um it seems
 
04:29:46.349 --> 04:29:46.359 align:start position:0%
the removal of the damag threshold will
 
04:29:49.229 --> 04:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
accomplish what Dees is looking for so
 
04:29:53.109 --> 04:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
we ask that um there be revisions
 
04:29:58.189 --> 04:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
made to retain the notification piece
 
04:30:01.469 --> 04:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions represent representative Derby
 
04:30:06.510 --> 04:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
The Call by representative wolf thank
 
04:30:07.950 --> 04:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:30:09.790 --> 04:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
question are you familiar with
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
subsection B of the pro of the law you
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
of the bill that's being change you
 
04:30:16.469 --> 04:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
notice of course that at line five ends
 
04:30:18.109 --> 04:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
with a colon because there's three
 
04:30:20.030 --> 04:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
subsections below that and those three
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
subsections haven't changed subsection B
 
04:30:25.070 --> 04:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
says the commiss commissioner after
 
04:30:29.349 --> 04:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
notice and hearing pursuant to RSA 541a
 
04:30:32.790 --> 04:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
May impose an administrative fine so I
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
just want wondering if you had
 
04:30:36.870 --> 04:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
considered the both both the fact that
 
04:30:39.030 --> 04:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
um after notice in hearing which is
 
04:30:42.510 --> 04:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
required and the May if that you you
 
04:30:44.510 --> 04:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
still believe that the commissioner has
 
04:30:47.109 --> 04:30:47.119 align:start position:0%
to impose the fine and that notification
 
04:30:50.229 --> 04:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
isn't required thank you yeah thank you
 
04:30:51.750 --> 04:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't have that in front of me at
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
the moment um but to our um stakeholders
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
that it was unclear to them at the
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
reading of this that they Dees retained
 
04:31:06.269 --> 04:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
um that in any other way yeah
 
04:31:06.279 --> 04:31:08.469 align:start position:0%
um that in any other way yeah
representative

04:31:08.469 --> 04:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:31:11.590 --> 04:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
wolf do you believe that there's any
 
04:31:13.790 --> 04:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
obligation on the part of the Realtors
 
04:31:16.950 --> 04:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
to apprise purchasers of the Shoreland
 
04:31:16.960 --> 04:31:18.229 align:start position:0%
to apprise purchasers of the Shoreland
protection

04:31:18.229 --> 04:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
act yeah so we do um provide
 
04:31:24.429 --> 04:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
notification obviously every um there
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
are many practitioners that are not
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
Realtors so I can only speak for my own
 
04:31:32.670 --> 04:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
um my own Professional Organization um
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
however there are a lot of properties
 
04:31:35.870 --> 04:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
that don't train change ownership so
 
04:31:37.870 --> 04:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
there's not an opportunity for this
 
04:31:39.990 --> 04:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
education to occur for a number of
 
04:31:42.910 --> 04:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:45.550 --> 04:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
state any other questions by members of
 
04:31:47.149 --> 04:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
the of the
 
04:31:54.790 --> 04:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:57.149 --> 04:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
much Glen
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:04.479 --> 04:32:11.269 align:start position:0%
 
pond

04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you folks for letting me say just
 
04:32:18.550 --> 04:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
a a few words um uh at HOV Han we we
 
04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
applied uh to uh build an addition uh to
 
04:32:25.109 --> 04:32:25.119 align:start position:0%
our house we went through the whole
 
04:32:29.670 --> 04:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
process of making out the extensive um
 
04:32:32.750 --> 04:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh Shoreline protection act requirements
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
and we uh we promised to do do certain
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
things to uh toh put in vegetative
 
04:32:44.510 --> 04:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
buffers and uh do storm water mitigation
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
and so forth and I always assumed that
 
04:32:51.790 --> 04:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
if we didn't do that that there would be
 
04:32:55.389 --> 04:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
a penalty uh and that seems to be that
 
04:32:57.149 --> 04:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
seems to be a reasonable thing whether
 
04:33:00.070 --> 04:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
or not there was long-term damage to the
 
04:33:03.910 --> 04:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
water body uh or not if if you signed
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
and said you would do certain things
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
then there should be a penalty because
 
04:33:11.109 --> 04:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
you didn't do them uh and that's that's
 
04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
essentially uh uh what I what I wanted
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
to say and it turned out that uh we uh
 
04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
did not do the property addition so we
 
04:33:22.709 --> 04:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
we never had to to to worry about that
 
04:33:24.869 --> 04:33:24.879 align:start position:0%
but it seems straightforward that if you
 
04:33:26.750 --> 04:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
said you were going to do
 
04:33:28.750 --> 04:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
something then you should do it and
 
04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
there should be a penalty if you didn't
 
04:33:30.080 --> 04:33:31.510 align:start position:0%
there should be a penalty if you didn't
do

04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
it be glad to take any
 
04:33:34.359 --> 04:33:36.189 align:start position:0%
it be glad to take any
questions

04:33:36.189 --> 04:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:33:36.199 --> 04:33:37.949 align:start position:0%
questions
representative

04:33:37.949 --> 04:33:37.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
lante thank you uh so when you said you
 
04:33:42.910 --> 04:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
filled out the paperwork was that for
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
your building permit application yes yes
 
04:33:49.310 --> 04:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
it was with the town well we were told
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
by the town that the first thing we had
 
04:33:54.910 --> 04:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
to do was to make out this entire
 
04:33:57.310 --> 04:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
application from the shorland protection
 
04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
act um and then in the end and we got
 
04:34:04.189 --> 04:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
permission we um and then we went
 
04:34:07.869 --> 04:34:07.879 align:start position:0%
through uh the time of Lowden and we and
 
04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
we were
 
04:34:12.750 --> 04:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
denied um had Fairly complicated set of
 
04:34:14.830 --> 04:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances but we were denied so we
 
04:34:17.230 --> 04:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't do the building um
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me I had promised to do
 
04:34:20.510 --> 04:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
certain things we had promised to do
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
certain things if we didn't do it there
 
04:34:24.910 --> 04:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
should be there should be a
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
penalty okay thank
 
04:34:30.349 --> 04:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
04:34:30.359 --> 04:34:32.629 align:start position:0%

04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
question seeing no one else thank you
 
04:34:38.109 --> 04:34:38.119 align:start position:0%

Association thank you for giving me this
 
04:34:59.230 --> 04:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak um I'm Pat tarpy
 
04:35:01.470 --> 04:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
I'm president of the Lake wabaki
 
04:35:05.310 --> 04:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
Association we are a 501c3 nonprofit
 
04:35:07.269 --> 04:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
whose mission is dedicated to protecting
 
04:35:09.629 --> 04:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
the water quality and natural resources
 
04:35:12.629 --> 04:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
of the lake and the Watershed so we work
 
04:35:15.230 --> 04:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
with the eight shorefront towns as well
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
as there's a total of 14 municipalities
 
04:35:19.109 --> 04:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
within that
 
04:35:19.119 --> 04:35:21.429 align:start position:0%
within that
Watershed

04:35:21.429 --> 04:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
Watershed
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
um i' I'd like to point out I guess a
 
04:35:28.830 --> 04:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
few bullets and um first of all the the
 
04:35:31.551 --> 04:35:31.561 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of the RSA
 
04:35:36.029 --> 04:35:36.039 align:start position:0%
483 is that the state recognizes is that
 
04:35:36.039 --> 04:35:37.429 align:start position:0%
483 is that the state recognizes is that
the

04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:35:40.990 --> 04:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
shorefront are are valuable and fragile
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
natural resources and our public waters
 
04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
are held in the trust of the
 
04:35:49.269 --> 04:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
state our organization cannot enforce
 
04:35:53.709 --> 04:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
any rules the municipalities tend to
 
04:35:56.551 --> 04:35:56.561 align:start position:0%
look to the state when it's in that 250
 
04:35:59.230 --> 04:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
ft Shoreland Zone even if the local
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities can adopt
 
04:36:04.510 --> 04:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
stricter I work with a lot of them and
 
04:36:06.189 --> 04:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
there's different mentalities within
 
04:36:07.949 --> 04:36:07.959 align:start position:0%
each town around Lake
 
04:36:10.750 --> 04:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
winaki um some are more proactive but
 
04:36:13.590 --> 04:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
others do say the state says this that's
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
what we're going to go by or it's a
 
04:36:17.869 --> 04:36:17.879 align:start position:0%
public water it's the state's
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to enforce this act it's
 
04:36:23.470 --> 04:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
not ours Code Enforcement Officers we
 
04:36:26.470 --> 04:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
have found are very reluctant and they
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
are overburdened with other areas that
 
04:36:30.269 --> 04:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:36:32.709 --> 04:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
following that's one of my point our
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
organization receives complaints every
 
04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
year here about violations of this act
 
04:36:40.551 --> 04:36:40.561 align:start position:0%
and they are frustrated they're
 
04:36:43.269 --> 04:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
frustrated with Dees and that's not
 
04:36:45.551 --> 04:36:45.561 align:start position:0%
always fair to DS I think because their
 
04:36:47.949 --> 04:36:47.959 align:start position:0%
hands tend to be tied at times as
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
Darlene has just been
 
04:36:54.109 --> 04:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
indicating um I also sat on the state's
 
04:36:56.310 --> 04:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria planning advisory
 
04:36:59.189 --> 04:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
committee they released their plan in
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
November of last year this was one of
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
their recommendations by the advisory
 
04:37:05.869 --> 04:37:05.879 align:start position:0%
committee member
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
um to have strict stronger enforcement
 
04:37:12.029 --> 04:37:12.039 align:start position:0%
and penalty structure Dees is not asking
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
for a stronger penalty structure they're
 
04:37:17.590 --> 04:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
just asking to remove being able to
 
04:37:20.869 --> 04:37:20.879 align:start position:0%
prove that the water quality impact has
 
04:37:24.429 --> 04:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
occurred um I submitted online testimony
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
and in that you'll see I did submit
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
photos of one particular egregious
 
04:37:31.629 --> 04:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
property on lake
 
04:37:35.310 --> 04:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
winaki and my fourth point is the
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
Shoreland represents to me the first and
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
last line of defense for pollution from
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
entering our water bodies and I would
 
04:37:45.910 --> 04:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
Advocate that shorefront property owners
 
04:37:47.949 --> 04:37:47.959 align:start position:0%
actually have a greater responsibility
 
04:37:50.429 --> 04:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
to know what the law is because anything
 
04:37:54.629 --> 04:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
they do directly impacts that lake or
 
04:37:57.551 --> 04:37:57.561 align:start position:0%
Pond um ignorance of the law I don't
 
04:37:59.150 --> 04:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
think is a very
 
04:37:59.160 --> 04:38:01.070 align:start position:0%
think is a very
good

04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
excuse probably personally um also once
 
04:38:08.349 --> 04:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
the violation has occurred the damage is
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
done the trees are cut the foundations
 
04:38:13.070 --> 04:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
poured the shorelines
 
04:38:15.949 --> 04:38:15.959 align:start position:0%
destroyed we have conducted watershed
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
management studies on Lake quak for
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
several of the bay areas and I can tell
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
you from the nutrient modeling that we
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
have done there's a lag time and impact
 
04:38:28.349 --> 04:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
and it can take up to 10 years before
 
04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to see the impacts to the
 
04:38:33.070 --> 04:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
lake from what was done from development
 
04:38:36.230 --> 04:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
10 years prior so I would urge the
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee to support this bill and pass
 
04:38:42.750 --> 04:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
it and I'll take any
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
questions any question representative
 
04:38:48.150 --> 04:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
Derby then representative hary bull
 
04:38:50.150 --> 04:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um chair um thank you for
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
question um like you mentioned Shoreline
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
or um waterfront property owners bear a
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
burden of responsibility to understand
 
04:39:04.269 --> 04:39:04.279 align:start position:0%
the the rules of of their Lake of their
 
04:39:05.949 --> 04:39:05.959 align:start position:0%
you know their part property I'm
 
04:39:08.029 --> 04:39:08.039 align:start position:0%
wondering most of these lakes and I have
 
04:39:10.869 --> 04:39:10.879 align:start position:0%
to imagine your organization has a
 
04:39:12.310 --> 04:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
Property Owners Association or maybe
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
multiple property owners associations do
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
you know if if they try to get out the
 
04:39:19.990 --> 04:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
word to Property Owners to make them
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
aware of of sort of good Property
 
04:39:26.470 --> 04:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
Maintenance practices and also sort of
 
04:39:30.189 --> 04:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
uh U concerns with violating this this
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
act thank
 
04:39:35.949 --> 04:39:35.959 align:start position:0%
you um there are m multiple homeowner
 
04:39:38.190 --> 04:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
associations or Road associations on
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
Winn pasak um they hold annual meetings
 
04:39:46.390 --> 04:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the summer I would say Pro I'm going
 
04:39:48.350 --> 04:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
to say most of them do try and share
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
this information we have an email list
 
04:39:53.990 --> 04:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
where we send out notifications of
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
services we offer what we're doing um we
 
04:40:00.110 --> 04:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
work with we partner with New Hampshire
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
Lakes on providing what's called be wiy
 
04:40:06.708 --> 04:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
blue at link smart which is a program
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
for residential property owners where
 
04:40:10.868 --> 04:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
we'll go out and voluntarily walk their
 
04:40:12.190 --> 04:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
property with them and give them
 
04:40:14.270 --> 04:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations on making
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
improvements uh a lot of these homeowner
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
associations or smaller Lake
 
04:40:20.590 --> 04:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
Associations are aware of that
 
04:40:24.270 --> 04:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
program um but there are times when I've
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
tried to go speak to a small Homeowner
 
04:40:29.868 --> 04:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
Association and they like we're not
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
04:40:35.310 --> 04:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
hearing certain aspects so
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for all of them I would
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:46.190 --> 04:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
out all right representative Harvey bul
 
04:40:48.708 --> 04:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you uh Mr chair and
 
04:40:52.190 --> 04:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for your testimony can you
 
04:40:54.550 --> 04:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
um you spoke about the violation the
 
04:40:56.670 --> 04:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
complaints that you've received can you
 
04:40:58.670 --> 04:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
give me some of the most
 
04:41:00.990 --> 04:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
common uh some examples of the most
 
04:41:04.150 --> 04:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
common violations that are that people
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
are repor in or that that you know about
 
04:41:08.190 --> 04:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
that are happening
 
04:41:11.110 --> 04:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
thanks I would say tree cutting is the
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
most common complaint I get whether it's
 
04:41:16.590 --> 04:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
clear cutting or even taking down
 
04:41:16.600 --> 04:41:17.830 align:start position:0%
clear cutting or even taking down
individual

04:41:17.830 --> 04:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
trees um erosion issues coming into the
 
04:41:25.830 --> 04:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
lake lack of proper barriers to prevent
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
that um those are the most common that
 
04:41:33.270 --> 04:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:35.708 --> 04:41:35.718 align:start position:0%
receive any other questions by members
 
04:41:36.830 --> 04:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very

04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
Lakes good afternoon members of the

committee I'm Andrea Laro the president
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire lakes and I thank you
 
04:42:02.830 --> 04:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to just say a few
 
04:42:06.030 --> 04:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
brief words um in support of this bill
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes we're a Statewide
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization we represent
 
04:42:10.798 --> 04:42:11.910 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization we represent
about

04:42:11.910 --> 04:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:42:13.788 --> 04:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
275 Lake
 
04:42:17.270 --> 04:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
Associations and a couple of thousand uh
 
04:42:17.280 --> 04:42:18.390 align:start position:0%
Associations and a couple of thousand uh
Lake

04:42:18.390 --> 04:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
Lake
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
enthusiasts and we support this bill for
 
04:42:22.830 --> 04:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
all of the reasons that representative
 
04:42:26.628 --> 04:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
rang Dees um and Lake wnab basaki
 
04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
Association have uh already explain to
 
04:42:32.830 --> 04:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
you and I just thought I would add that
 
04:42:34.270 --> 04:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of talk about wiip
 
04:42:36.628 --> 04:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
pasak Rock and some of the unfortunate
 
04:42:39.830 --> 04:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
egregious violations um on the big lake
 
04:42:42.510 --> 04:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
and again we represent 275 Lake
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
Associations and this is a Statewide
 
04:42:47.750 --> 04:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
problem uh I would say for the most part
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
um you know folks don't mean to violate
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
the ACT um but there are some folks out
 
04:42:57.270 --> 04:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
there that um maybe they decide that
 
04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's you know it doesn't have much teeth
 
04:43:02.230 --> 04:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know they're going to risk it and
 
04:43:04.948 --> 04:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
and do this project um because they're
 
04:43:08.030 --> 04:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
not going to get you know snagged for it
 
04:43:09.868 --> 04:43:09.878 align:start position:0%
um we hear often from our Lake
 
04:43:12.910 --> 04:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
Association members um that this is very
 
04:43:14.830 --> 04:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
frustrating that you know they Lake
 
04:43:16.628 --> 04:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
Associations throughout the state these
 
04:43:18.990 --> 04:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
are volunteers that are donating their
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
time um and their resources their their
 
04:43:24.990 --> 04:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
their their money to uh do projects and
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
do education to uh help protect um the
 
04:43:31.390 --> 04:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
lakes of New Hampshire for all of us and
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's there's nothing more you know
 
04:43:35.470 --> 04:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
disincentivizing are frustrating for
 
04:43:36.750 --> 04:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
them when you know they are spending all
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
this time and energy and sweat acurity
 
04:43:41.070 --> 04:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
to protect the state resource and then
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
someone you know someone um that thinks
 
04:43:46.948 --> 04:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
differently goes ahead and removes all
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
the trees on their property or you does
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
some other IR reparable egregious
 
04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
violation and and it really becomes a
 
04:43:56.270 --> 04:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
sour spot for all these good people that
 
04:43:58.830 --> 04:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
are trying to protect our our Lakes so
 
04:44:03.470 --> 04:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
to have the ability uh for Dees to um
 
04:44:06.190 --> 04:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
hold those people accountable who um you
 
04:44:08.430 --> 04:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
know won't work with them to fix the
 
04:44:10.750 --> 04:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
problem um I think is a step in the
 
04:44:12.750 --> 04:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
right direction to help protect uh the
 
04:44:15.190 --> 04:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
fragile health of our lakes and I would
 
04:44:17.990 --> 04:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any
 
04:44:20.670 --> 04:44:20.680 align:start position:0%

05:00:31.948 --> 05:00:31.958 align:start position:0%
before us multiple times there is a
 
05:00:33.430 --> 05:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
reason for this
 
05:00:36.270 --> 05:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
septic systems in Failure not only cause
 
05:00:38.628 --> 05:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
untreated sewage to be released to the
 
05:00:41.190 --> 05:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
ground surface Andor to back up into
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
pipes but failed septic systems near a
 
05:00:47.910 --> 05:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
water shoreline cause a runoff of sewage
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
into that water this runoff can has
 
05:00:53.788 --> 05:00:53.798 align:start position:0%
contributed to increased nutrients that
 
05:00:56.150 --> 05:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
with increasing warming water
 
05:00:58.310 --> 05:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
temperatures trigger cyanobacteria
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
blooms toxic cyanobacteria blooms create
 
05:01:04.708 --> 05:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
a serious health r risk to our lakes and
 
05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
rivers and for any person or pet
 
05:01:09.910 --> 05:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
recreating in them so the impact of
 
05:01:12.510 --> 05:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
failed systems goes far beyond the
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
property owner and their property it
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
becomes a public threat as you'll hear
 
05:01:21.150 --> 05:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
from Dees failed septic systems can
 
05:01:24.270 --> 05:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
account for up to 22% of the phosphorus
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
loading of lakes if we can make Headway
 
05:01:29.830 --> 05:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
into reducing this load it will help
 
05:01:32.948 --> 05:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
address the rise in cyanobacteria blooms
 
05:01:35.190 --> 05:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lakes and rivers are
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
experiencing this build does not go
 
05:01:40.230 --> 05:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
after every Waterfront septic system
 
05:01:42.788 --> 05:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
it's only impacting properties within
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
the sensitive Shoreline Zone that are
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
being sold to ensure their failed septic
 
05:01:50.310 --> 05:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
systems do not get passed down to the
 
05:01:54.190 --> 05:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
new owner to continue the sewage runoff
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
HB 1113 requires developed Waterfront
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
which is already defined in statute and
 
05:02:05.390 --> 05:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
new in this bill to be within 250 ft of
 
05:02:08.270 --> 05:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
the waters reference line to have their
 
05:02:11.548 --> 05:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
septic systems evaluated only if it was
 
05:02:15.390 --> 05:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
never approved by Dees to begin with OR
 
05:02:18.350 --> 05:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
that approval is older than 20 years if
 
05:02:20.310 --> 05:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
it is determined to be in Failure the
 
05:02:22.948 --> 05:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
sale is contingent on its
 
05:02:25.990 --> 05:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
replacement now I realize opponents to
 
05:02:28.470 --> 05:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
this bill will claim that it is unfair
 
05:02:30.670 --> 05:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
to people who must sell their property
 
05:02:33.270 --> 05:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
within a reasonable time frame as
 
05:02:35.628 --> 05:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
replacing a system can take several
 
05:02:38.510 --> 05:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
months I see their point and I'm willing
 
05:02:41.310 --> 05:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
to draft an amendment to require the
 
05:02:43.868 --> 05:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
buyer a fair time frame to replace the
 
05:02:46.110 --> 05:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
septic system with subsequent
 
05:02:47.830 --> 05:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
notification to
 
05:02:51.350 --> 05:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
Dees I also understand that some buyers
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
want the property so they can demolish
 
05:02:56.110 --> 05:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
the existing structure and rebuild a new
 
05:02:58.708 --> 05:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
one which would require a new septic
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
system design anyway I am open to that
 
05:03:04.548 --> 05:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
Amendment as well well but I am not open
 
05:03:07.548 --> 05:03:07.558 align:start position:0%
and neither should we or any granite
 
05:03:09.910 --> 05:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
Staters to allowing a failed septic
 
05:03:12.910 --> 05:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
system to continue to pollute our public
 
05:03:15.350 --> 05:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
Waters without any plan for
 
05:03:19.070 --> 05:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
resolution HB 11113 needs to be a bill
 
05:03:21.310 --> 05:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
this re this committee recommends for
 
05:03:25.350 --> 05:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
passage as possibly amended and I I
 
05:03:27.948 --> 05:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
probably would um want to suggest to the
 
05:03:29.910 --> 05:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
chair that we have a work session on
 
05:03:31.948 --> 05:03:31.958 align:start position:0%
this or I can work on amendments with
 
05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
anybody who's willing willing to help to
 
05:03:36.190 --> 05:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
account for some of those situations
 
05:03:39.270 --> 05:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
where um replacing the septic system by
 
05:03:43.310 --> 05:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
closing is presents undue hardship to
 
05:03:46.230 --> 05:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
the buyer or to the seller so with that
 
05:03:47.948 --> 05:03:47.958 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to address any questions
 
05:03:47.958 --> 05:03:50.628 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to address any questions
you

05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
have any questions by members of the
 
05:03:57.430 --> 05:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:00.670 --> 05:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
lontine hello do you know if um they
 
05:04:03.350 --> 05:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
choose to remodel or ADD an addition to
 
05:04:05.150 --> 05:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
the old house as opposed to just
 
05:04:06.990 --> 05:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
demolishing it do they also have to get
 
05:04:10.190 --> 05:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
a new septic permit or I'm not exactly
 
05:04:12.628 --> 05:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
sure but um I know the person here from
 
05:04:14.750 --> 05:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
DS makes their living understanding
 
05:04:17.910 --> 05:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
septic system so I'm going to defer to
 
05:04:20.910 --> 05:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
to Mr troid to answer
 
05:04:23.548 --> 05:04:23.558 align:start position:0%
that any other questions from members of
 
05:04:23.558 --> 05:04:27.270 align:start position:0%
that any other questions from members of
the

05:04:27.270 --> 05:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:29.430 --> 05:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative harb then
 
05:04:31.628 --> 05:04:31.638 align:start position:0%
representative wolf thank you
 
05:04:33.270 --> 05:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question do
 
05:04:35.868 --> 05:04:35.878 align:start position:0%
you have any opinion at this time about
 
05:04:39.390 --> 05:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
the time to um remedy and rectify the
 
05:04:42.190 --> 05:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
problem with the septic system and part
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
two of that is in mass under Title Five
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
they give the owner a year to remedy did
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
you have any idea is that sufficient or
 
05:04:54.430 --> 05:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
would you agree to a year in an
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
amendment um I I would be open anything
 
05:04:58.788 --> 05:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
I just think it's really important that
 
05:05:01.070 --> 05:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
we put an end date on a failed septic
 
05:05:03.190 --> 05:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
system and just say you know by this
 
05:05:06.510 --> 05:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
date you have to have it replaced or you
 
05:05:08.910 --> 05:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
have to vacate the property I mean I can
 
05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
understand if someone's buying an Old
 
05:05:12.628 --> 05:05:12.638 align:start position:0%
Camp and they have plans to demolish it
 
05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
and and build a year round home that it
 
05:05:19.708 --> 05:05:19.718 align:start position:0%
may take them more than a year but after
 
05:05:22.190 --> 05:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
maybe a year they would either have to
 
05:05:25.390 --> 05:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
have um a septic system replaced or in
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
process or um or they'd have to vacate
 
05:05:31.110 --> 05:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
the property but we just can't allow
 
05:05:34.510 --> 05:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
that continued SE AG to to go into our
 
05:05:37.310 --> 05:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
Lakes um I'm I'm happy to work with
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
anyone on this I just I think we need to
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
make progress as I've said and and and
 
05:05:42.750 --> 05:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
you've seen this representative heart
 
05:05:44.430 --> 05:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
we've just seen these bills come and
 
05:05:46.350 --> 05:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
come and come and we've made no progress
 
05:05:49.110 --> 05:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
on it and when I look at watershed
 
05:05:50.270 --> 05:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
management plans that have been
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
submitted to Dees and see that up to 22%
 
05:05:57.150 --> 05:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
of that loading is from failed septic
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
systems you know we have to we have to
 
05:06:01.628 --> 05:06:01.638 align:start position:0%
start somewhere and I thought starting
 
05:06:03.070 --> 05:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
with homes that are transferring
 
05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
ownership is is probably a good place to
 
05:06:07.910 --> 05:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
start because it does give that
 
05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
government or regulator regulatory um
 
05:06:14.070 --> 05:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
involvement engagement in that process
 
05:06:16.110 --> 05:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
to ensure that it can
 
05:06:18.788 --> 05:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
occur representative wolf for a question
 
05:06:21.628 --> 05:06:21.638 align:start position:0%
Then followed by representative Darby
 
05:06:23.590 --> 05:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:06:27.470 --> 05:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question this only pertains to
 
05:06:30.230 --> 05:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
houses that are in the process of being
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
sold correct are you aware of towns that
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
are now putting in regular requirements
 
05:06:42.788 --> 05:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
for annual um Tri anual inspections no
 
05:06:44.510 --> 05:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not I think that's a wonderful idea
 
05:06:47.788 --> 05:06:47.798 align:start position:0%
representative wolf um no this is I just
 
05:06:50.070 --> 05:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
think I wanted to come up with some
 
05:06:53.350 --> 05:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
minimal solution to start working on the
 
05:06:55.990 --> 05:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
problem some some something to make some
 
05:06:58.030 --> 05:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
progress I do understand that there are
 
05:07:00.868 --> 05:07:00.878 align:start position:0%
some communities that have strict septic
 
05:07:04.190 --> 05:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
ordinances and they're very engaged with
 
05:07:06.708 --> 05:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
inspections and and I think what we
 
05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
heard from um Miss tarpy from Lake
 
05:07:12.430 --> 05:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
winaki Association though that there
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
there those type of municipalities run
 
05:07:16.310 --> 05:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
the gamut there could be some that
 
05:07:17.910 --> 05:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
really aren't engaged they just don't
 
05:07:20.590 --> 05:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
have the time for a health officer to be
 
05:07:24.548 --> 05:07:24.558 align:start position:0%
involved in in a septic system issue and
 
05:07:28.430 --> 05:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
and there's some that that do but as was
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
also stated these are are are Waters
 
05:07:33.390 --> 05:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
held in the public public trust and I
 
05:07:35.310 --> 05:07:35.320 align:start position:0%
think we need to start making progress
 
05:07:38.350 --> 05:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
on protecting those
 
05:07:41.350 --> 05:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
waters for a followup just a quick
 
05:07:44.628 --> 05:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
followup there is one of the four towns
 
05:07:47.510 --> 05:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the sopy Watershed has it in law now
 
05:07:48.628 --> 05:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
and there are two others that are
 
05:07:50.830 --> 05:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
bringing up the town meeting good I'd
 
05:07:52.030 --> 05:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
like to look at those I'll check them
 
05:07:54.990 --> 05:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
out thank you representative Derby for a
 
05:07:57.470 --> 05:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank thank
 
05:07:58.948 --> 05:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
you representative rang for taking my
 
05:08:02.830 --> 05:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
question um this is sort of related um
 
05:08:05.230 --> 05:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
to what representative wolf said um
 
05:08:08.750 --> 05:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
section two of this bill um it seems to
 
05:08:11.230 --> 05:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
be slightly different um but I but maybe
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's not maybe I'm just misreading it
 
05:08:16.948 --> 05:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
it's about um it's basically I think
 
05:08:20.310 --> 05:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
about letting local municipalities um
 
05:08:23.868 --> 05:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
provide U more strict requirements I'm
 
05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
just hoping to get your perspective on
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
what section two was intended to do um
 
05:08:31.868 --> 05:08:31.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question um
 
05:08:34.670 --> 05:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to actually um ask if you
 
05:08:37.510 --> 05:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
could ask um Mr trobridge that question
 
05:08:40.150 --> 05:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
um I I actually work with Dees on this
 
05:08:44.030 --> 05:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
bill um I mean I I think we still have
 
05:08:47.230 --> 05:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
some some amending to do to make it
 
05:08:49.628 --> 05:08:49.638 align:start position:0%
really um address the the concerns that
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
are out there but um I do know that
 
05:08:55.190 --> 05:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
Municipal municipalities that have
 
05:08:58.150 --> 05:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
stricter rules those those hold those
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
would have to be followed first before
 
05:09:05.708 --> 05:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:08.150 --> 05:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
would any questions by any other members
 
05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
05:09:14.708 --> 05:09:14.718 align:start position:0%
seea there thank you Mr chair I'm
 
05:09:17.470 --> 05:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
looking at um oh hopefully I can gather
 
05:09:22.230 --> 05:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:25.708 --> 05:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
here the 250 ft of reference line that's
 
05:09:29.070 --> 05:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
on line five on the first page of the
 
05:09:31.548 --> 05:09:31.558 align:start position:0%
bill um do you know why that was changed
 
05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
from 200 fet of reference line I believe
 
05:09:39.230 --> 05:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
200 feet existed in an earlier bill um
 
05:09:43.110 --> 05:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
by representative Spang and and I'm I'm
 
05:09:46.430 --> 05:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
hoping that Mr troit could provide
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
Clarity for that but I believe the
 
05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
regulation was changed to 250 so this
 
05:09:52.628 --> 05:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
reflects the new
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
regulation thank you so
 
05:09:57.628 --> 05:09:57.638 align:start position:0%
much any other questions by members of
 
05:09:57.638 --> 05:09:58.470 align:start position:0%
much any other questions by members of
the

05:09:58.470 --> 05:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:05.230 --> 05:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:09.310 --> 05:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:14.150 --> 05:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:17.150 --> 05:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
Dees oh there's two of
 
05:10:25.310 --> 05:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:28.868 --> 05:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
damn right good afternoon chairman Rulo
 
05:10:30.590 --> 05:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
05:10:32.310 --> 05:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
my name is Philip Trowbridge I'm the
 
05:10:34.110 --> 05:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
manager of the land resources management
 
05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
program at Dees which includes the
 
05:10:38.270 --> 05:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
subsystem subsurface systems Bureau
 
05:10:40.470 --> 05:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
which regulates septic systems and
 
05:10:42.548 --> 05:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
joining me today is Scott Hazelton who's
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
the new administrator of the subservice
 
05:10:44.280 --> 05:10:45.628 align:start position:0%
the new administrator of the subservice
systems

05:10:45.628 --> 05:10:45.638 align:start position:0%
systems
 
05:10:51.310 --> 05:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh can I ask uh Mr hegels toh
 
05:10:53.548 --> 05:10:53.558 align:start position:0%
fill out a card after after after it's
 
05:10:56.708 --> 05:10:56.718 align:start position:0%
over after you finish their supply
 
05:10:58.708 --> 05:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh so I'd like to start with
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background if I could uh
 
05:11:02.270 --> 05:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
and then I've been trying to jot on the
 
05:11:06.628 --> 05:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
questions that have come along um uh RSA
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
45 a39 requires a site assessment be
 
05:11:11.548 --> 05:11:11.558 align:start position:0%
done as a part of a real estate
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
transaction for waterfront properties um
 
05:11:16.590 --> 05:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
some things about that the Waterfront
 
05:11:18.350 --> 05:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
site assessment is done by a permitted
 
05:11:20.190 --> 05:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
05:11:22.590 --> 05:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
designer uh what it tells you is it
 
05:11:25.708 --> 05:11:25.718 align:start position:0%
tells you how much Wastewater uh the lot
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
can handle for
 
05:11:30.310 --> 05:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
treatment um it's uh it's based on the
 
05:11:32.470 --> 05:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
soils of the lot the size of the lot lot
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
whether there's Wetlands on the property
 
05:11:36.990 --> 05:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
whether there's ledge as I like to say
 
05:11:39.628 --> 05:11:39.638 align:start position:0%
geology is Destiny when it comes to how
 
05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
much water waste water can be treated by
 
05:11:41.760 --> 05:11:42.510 align:start position:0%
much water waste water can be treated by
a

05:11:42.510 --> 05:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:11:45.270 --> 05:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
lot uh the reason this was done and why
 
05:11:47.628 --> 05:11:47.638 align:start position:0%
it's important is that um a lot of
 
05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
people buying properties are looking to
 
05:11:51.030 --> 05:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
expand them and they may be buying a
 
05:11:53.430 --> 05:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
small camp but they eventually want to
 
05:11:54.990 --> 05:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
build a four-bedroom house and they need
 
05:11:57.430 --> 05:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
to know the time of sale whether the lot
 
05:12:00.230 --> 05:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
can handle that Wastewater um there's
 
05:12:02.430 --> 05:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
also cases where there's been after the
 
05:12:04.628 --> 05:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
fact um or there's been an illegal
 
05:12:06.270 --> 05:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
expansion of a property someone's buying
 
05:12:08.190 --> 05:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
a four-bedroom house they think it's the
 
05:12:09.670 --> 05:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
septic system when lot can handle a
 
05:12:12.070 --> 05:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
4bedroom house and they are unpleasantly
 
05:12:15.310 --> 05:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
surprised that it cannot uh so that's uh
 
05:12:18.110 --> 05:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
what the Waterfront site assessment does
 
05:12:20.750 --> 05:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh what it doesn't do is it doesn't
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
evaluate the condition of the septic
 
05:12:24.470 --> 05:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
system on the
 
05:12:26.788 --> 05:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
property uh which is been part of a
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
weakness uh of the bill um or of the
 
05:12:30.840 --> 05:12:32.390 align:start position:0%
weakness uh of the bill um or of the
statute

05:12:32.390 --> 05:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:12:35.310 --> 05:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
HB 1113 would add this detailed
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the existing septic system
 
05:12:39.548 --> 05:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
you know for properties where the septic
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
system either does not have a state
 
05:12:44.590 --> 05:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
approval uh or that state approval is
 
05:12:46.750 --> 05:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
more than 20 years old so it's taking a
 
05:12:49.750 --> 05:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
sort of segment of the properties uh and
 
05:12:51.310 --> 05:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
saying that someone should really take a
 
05:12:53.190 --> 05:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
look at the specific on the sub system
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:12:56.948 --> 05:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
ground um it also adds a requirement
 
05:12:59.470 --> 05:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
that the failed system uh be replaced
 
05:13:02.910 --> 05:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
before the sale can go through
 
05:13:04.470 --> 05:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
the department feels that some sort of
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
Waterfront site assessment is important
 
05:13:09.030 --> 05:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
um a couple of reasons uh water quality
 
05:13:10.750 --> 05:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's Lakes is
 
05:13:13.750 --> 05:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
declining harmful algal blooms are more
 
05:13:17.948 --> 05:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
frequent uh in this last year in 2023 47
 
05:13:19.708 --> 05:13:19.718 align:start position:0%
of our Lakes had cyanobacteria
 
05:13:19.718 --> 05:13:22.390 align:start position:0%
of our Lakes had cyanobacteria
advisories

05:13:22.390 --> 05:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
issued failing septic systems is a
 
05:13:28.750 --> 05:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
significant contributor of the nutrients
 
05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
that uh fuel these algae blooms
 
05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh and detecting and fixing
 
05:13:36.190 --> 05:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
malfunctioning subject systems is a way
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
to immediately um take take action to
 
05:13:42.030 --> 05:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
reduce these nutrient loads and improve
 
05:13:44.708 --> 05:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
quality what we feel are important
 
05:13:48.548 --> 05:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
elements of a waterfront site assessment
 
05:13:52.030 --> 05:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
are there's really three of them um the
 
05:13:54.310 --> 05:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
buyers know what they're buying at the
 
05:13:56.590 --> 05:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
time of the transaction so that they can
 
05:13:58.390 --> 05:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
there can be proper negotiations between
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
the buyer and the
 
05:14:03.830 --> 05:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
seller ensuring that these waterfront
 
05:14:05.788 --> 05:14:05.798 align:start position:0%
properties have a state approved septic
 
05:14:07.230 --> 05:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
system that's been designed to
 
05:14:10.030 --> 05:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
adequately treat the waste uh there are
 
05:14:12.548 --> 05:14:12.558 align:start position:0%
plenty of camps out there that were are
 
05:14:17.310 --> 05:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
system uh and that third a professional
 
05:14:21.670 --> 05:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
looks at the system to determine if it's
 
05:14:24.670 --> 05:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
in Failure uh at the time of the sale uh
 
05:14:25.830 --> 05:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
so that we can make sure that it's
 
05:14:25.840 --> 05:14:28.628 align:start position:0%
so that we can make sure that it's
working

05:14:28.628 --> 05:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:31.910 --> 05:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
properly HB 1113 achieves these obes
 
05:14:34.510 --> 05:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
jectives uh but as representative rang
 
05:14:36.110 --> 05:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
alluded there may be some disagreement
 
05:14:38.910 --> 05:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
on the approach taken by this bill
 
05:14:41.948 --> 05:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
therefore the de is neutral on this bill
 
05:14:44.270 --> 05:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
however we do think that the the
 
05:14:46.110 --> 05:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
principles behind it are sound and there
 
05:14:47.750 --> 05:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
are ways to achieve these objectives
 
05:14:50.548 --> 05:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
support thank you and I'm um willing to
 
05:14:55.470 --> 05:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
take your questions
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%

represent
 
05:15:08.708 --> 05:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
oh representative D um thank you Mr
 
05:15:10.990 --> 05:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:15:13.948 --> 05:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
can um can you describe what a um I
 
05:15:16.990 --> 05:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
think you did but what a uh detailed sub
 
05:15:20.990 --> 05:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
Disposal system evaluation consists of
 
05:15:24.030 --> 05:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
um uh how much approximately how much it
 
05:15:27.788 --> 05:15:27.798 align:start position:0%
might cost as opposed to a site survey
 
05:15:32.788 --> 05:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
um and for um failed system
 
05:15:36.510 --> 05:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
um that are detected other than the um
 
05:15:38.430 --> 05:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
other than you know the cyanobacteria
 
05:15:39.628 --> 05:15:39.638 align:start position:0%
concerns we've heard because of
 
05:15:41.390 --> 05:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
phosphorus what other kinds of water
 
05:15:43.470 --> 05:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
quality problems could be
 
05:15:48.350 --> 05:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
introduced okay um so by detailed
 
05:15:52.390 --> 05:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
evaluation um what we what we expect is
 
05:15:55.390 --> 05:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
that someone investigates the system on
 
05:15:57.990 --> 05:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
the ground um and normally that involves
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
someone you know finding the septic tank
 
05:16:04.230 --> 05:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
opening that to see if it's
 
05:16:07.548 --> 05:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
cracked um reviewing the area of the
 
05:16:10.628 --> 05:16:10.638 align:start position:0%
leech field for any signs of breakout
 
05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
and as a designer we would be looking
 
05:16:16.350 --> 05:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
for someone to understand the depth to
 
05:16:18.788 --> 05:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
the water table in the vicinity of the
 
05:16:21.708 --> 05:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
septic system to know whether the system
 
05:16:25.230 --> 05:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
is in uh located in the the water
 
05:16:28.110 --> 05:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
table um I I can't tell you how many
 
05:16:29.868 --> 05:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
times I've spoken to someone who said
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
I've got the best septic system in the
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
the world it just works forever it's
 
05:16:36.150 --> 05:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
been in here for 50 years and it never
 
05:16:39.350 --> 05:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
fails and that's because it's basically
 
05:16:40.830 --> 05:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:16:43.590 --> 05:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
groundwater um so there's a there's
 
05:16:44.990 --> 05:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
something that's beneath the surface
 
05:16:46.670 --> 05:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
that needs to be
 
05:16:48.990 --> 05:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
evaluated in terms of the cost I really
 
05:16:50.788 --> 05:16:50.798 align:start position:0%
don't feel that I can say that right now
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a permanent designer
 
05:16:53.910 --> 05:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
this would be something that they would
 
05:16:58.548 --> 05:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
have to determine um uh but it's it
 
05:17:00.590 --> 05:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
would you know uh I'd say it's you know
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
on par with what their the charge is now
 
05:17:05.628 --> 05:17:05.638 align:start position:0%
for the Waterfront site
 
05:17:07.948 --> 05:17:07.958 align:start position:0%
assessment um and I think your third
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
question was what other water quality
 
05:17:13.030 --> 05:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
impacts would be associated with the
 
05:17:16.868 --> 05:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
failing septic system and the most uh
 
05:17:21.470 --> 05:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
obvious one is BAC ecoli bacteria and
 
05:17:24.270 --> 05:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
pathogens um in the waters that where
 
05:17:24.280 --> 05:17:29.310 align:start position:0%
pathogens um in the waters that where
people

05:17:29.310 --> 05:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:32.948 --> 05:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
swim representative tell
 
05:17:34.868 --> 05:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
it thank you for your testimony and
 
05:17:35.910 --> 05:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
05:17:38.548 --> 05:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for let me ask one um so I
 
05:17:40.270 --> 05:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't know how familiar you
 
05:17:41.910 --> 05:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
are with the current situation in Berlin
 
05:17:43.750 --> 05:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm from um I know a little
 
05:17:45.708 --> 05:17:45.718 align:start position:0%
I've been exposed to a little bit about
 
05:17:47.110 --> 05:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
feal matter bubbling through the ground
 
05:17:50.110 --> 05:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
in the last couple weeks on a river into
 
05:17:50.120 --> 05:17:51.310 align:start position:0%
in the last couple weeks on a river into
a

05:17:51.310 --> 05:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
river um so I guess my my question is
 
05:17:58.190 --> 05:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
you know what are the signs of a of a
 
05:18:00.708 --> 05:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
leaking septic system look like on a
 
05:18:00.718 --> 05:18:02.270 align:start position:0%
leaking septic system look like on a
shorel

05:18:02.270 --> 05:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
shorel
 
05:18:02.280 --> 05:18:03.310 align:start position:0%
shorel
uh

05:18:03.310 --> 05:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:06.070 --> 05:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
versus you know on a you know property
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
not near the Shoreland um you know I
 
05:18:11.948 --> 05:18:11.958 align:start position:0%
took us I don't this whole entire City's
 
05:18:13.628 --> 05:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
system was leaking into the river for
 
05:18:15.830 --> 05:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
several days a week before anyone was
 
05:18:17.868 --> 05:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
able to recognize that I'm sure that a
 
05:18:20.270 --> 05:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
residential property where the uh
 
05:18:21.910 --> 05:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
production is much
 
05:18:26.310 --> 05:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
smaller um might take more time
 
05:18:28.590 --> 05:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I will
 
05:18:30.070 --> 05:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
start with the response and then I'm
 
05:18:32.830 --> 05:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
going to turn this over to Scott um who
 
05:18:36.070 --> 05:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
has more experience in this area um
 
05:18:38.708 --> 05:18:38.718 align:start position:0%
there there's I think what you've
 
05:18:42.110 --> 05:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
experienced at a larger scale is is you
 
05:18:44.310 --> 05:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
know the same as what would be happening
 
05:18:46.548 --> 05:18:46.558 align:start position:0%
at a smaller scale it's just you know
 
05:18:49.670 --> 05:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
the sizes are different uh but the the
 
05:18:51.510 --> 05:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
obvious things that people look for are
 
05:18:54.350 --> 05:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
signs of breakout which is wetness odor
 
05:19:00.030 --> 05:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
is a very obvious thing um and um
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
the um and sometimes there's backup into
 
05:19:06.868 --> 05:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
the the house um like I said one of the
 
05:19:08.788 --> 05:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
things that's harder to detect is when
 
05:19:11.990 --> 05:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
the septic system is in the groundwater
 
05:19:14.708 --> 05:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
because then all of this is happening um
 
05:19:17.350 --> 05:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
out of sight and often out of mind and
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
by the time it reaches the water body
 
05:19:20.868 --> 05:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
which is I think the case you you're
 
05:19:23.548 --> 05:19:23.558 align:start position:0%
dealing with um it's in the water it's a
 
05:19:26.670 --> 05:19:26.680 align:start position:0%
little bit less you know it's harder to
 
05:19:30.350 --> 05:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
see um that's why it's important to know
 
05:19:33.150 --> 05:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh where the the elevation of the septic
 
05:19:35.310 --> 05:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
system relative to this to the water
 
05:19:37.590 --> 05:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
table in that area and that's what a
 
05:19:39.670 --> 05:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
permited designer can
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
do Scott would you like to add anything
 
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
no I think you've covered the majority
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
of it I think that uh one of the hardest
 
05:19:47.708 --> 05:19:47.718 align:start position:0%
things to do is to determine whether or
 
05:19:50.350 --> 05:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
not um a system is has been installed in
 
05:19:52.470 --> 05:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
that seasonal high water table and then
 
05:19:55.270 --> 05:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
as you alluded to that seeing this in a
 
05:19:58.190 --> 05:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
water body is also another difficult uh
 
05:19:59.708 --> 05:19:59.718 align:start position:0%
thing some of the other things you may
 
05:20:03.708 --> 05:20:03.718 align:start position:0%
see from a failed system are evidence of
 
05:20:06.510 --> 05:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
Cloudy slimy water surfacing somewhere
 
05:20:09.270 --> 05:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
along that effent disposal area and then
 
05:20:11.070 --> 05:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
flowing across the surface of the ground
 
05:20:13.470 --> 05:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
into the water table and those are those
 
05:20:16.190 --> 05:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
those can be tested um but short of
 
05:20:17.948 --> 05:20:17.958 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not a system is
 
05:20:19.910 --> 05:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
in the seasonal High groundwater table
 
05:20:22.510 --> 05:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
and then testing uh the the lakefront
 
05:20:25.230 --> 05:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
water for the presence of of
 
05:20:28.030 --> 05:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
contaminants caused by affluent um it's
 
05:20:28.040 --> 05:20:30.110 align:start position:0%
contaminants caused by affluent um it's
it's

05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:20:30.120 --> 05:20:33.030 align:start position:0%
it's
difficult

05:20:33.030 --> 05:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
05:20:35.788 --> 05:20:35.798 align:start position:0%
just a quick followup so I guess in our
 
05:20:37.470 --> 05:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
case it was pretty easy to point to the
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
city and say we know where it's coming
 
05:20:43.470 --> 05:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
from um is it it generally difficult to
 
05:20:45.548 --> 05:20:45.558 align:start position:0%
treat to like is if you have several
 
05:20:47.150 --> 05:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
Property Owners is it pretty easy to
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
track down which one's the the offending
 
05:20:53.788 --> 05:20:53.798 align:start position:0%
tank or is it is it uh you know does it
 
05:20:55.430 --> 05:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
in these type of Investigations or is it
 
05:20:55.440 --> 05:20:56.510 align:start position:0%
in these type of Investigations or is it
pretty

05:20:56.510 --> 05:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
05:20:59.390 --> 05:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
quick yeah thank you for the question I
 
05:21:02.548 --> 05:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
think in all cases the the level of the
 
05:21:04.350 --> 05:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
level of the of the problem is makes it
 
05:21:06.868 --> 05:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
easier to determine um and there are
 
05:21:09.270 --> 05:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
methods for you know doing bracketed
 
05:21:12.190 --> 05:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
testing so you um especially on a river
 
05:21:14.670 --> 05:21:14.680 align:start position:0%
where you can work your way upstream and
 
05:21:17.070 --> 05:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
you know determine where the V where the
 
05:21:19.030 --> 05:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
ecoi starts to be showing up you know
 
05:21:21.868 --> 05:21:21.878 align:start position:0%
obviously um properties Upstream uh
 
05:21:23.470 --> 05:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
Downstream of that would not be the
 
05:21:26.070 --> 05:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
issue and so it's not that difficult but
 
05:21:29.030 --> 05:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
it does involve doing some uh water
 
05:21:29.040 --> 05:21:30.030 align:start position:0%
it does involve doing some uh water
quality

05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
quality
 
05:21:30.040 --> 05:21:33.628 align:start position:0%
quality
testing

05:21:33.628 --> 05:21:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:34.948 --> 05:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
no one there's no one
 
05:21:37.868 --> 05:21:37.878 align:start position:0%
else just Ballpark and time frame like
 
05:21:40.310 --> 05:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
like what weeks or days or months or
 
05:21:41.590 --> 05:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
like how long does that investigation
 
05:21:45.390 --> 05:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
usually uh you know it's a uh the um for
 
05:21:47.548 --> 05:21:47.558 align:start position:0%
ecoi bacteria it has to be tested very
 
05:21:49.110 --> 05:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
quickly so you get a quick turnaround
 
05:21:51.230 --> 05:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
from the laboratory so it's it's kind of
 
05:21:53.230 --> 05:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
Manpower dependent uh as soon as you can
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
get people out to do the testing and and
 
05:21:59.190 --> 05:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
look at the property um it's not um you
 
05:22:01.750 --> 05:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
know it's more about you having someone
 
05:22:03.190 --> 05:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
be able to go out and collect the sample
 
05:22:05.948 --> 05:22:05.958 align:start position:0%
and get them to the lab then a long
 
05:22:05.958 --> 05:22:08.270 align:start position:0%
and get them to the lab then a long
analysis

05:22:08.270 --> 05:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
05:22:11.788 --> 05:22:11.798 align:start position:0%
time thank you representative Veil then
 
05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative Don thank you Mr chair um
 
05:22:17.548 --> 05:22:17.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question rang
 
05:22:19.430 --> 05:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
said that she would consider amending
 
05:22:22.270 --> 05:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
the bill to give the new owner six
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
months to replace the septic system as
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
long as they confirm with d Dees that
 
05:22:30.190 --> 05:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
the repair was made can Dees handle this
 
05:22:32.030 --> 05:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
extra administ rative
 
05:22:35.470 --> 05:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
task is that an issue yeah yes thank you
 
05:22:39.670 --> 05:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
for that question um we
 
05:22:42.628 --> 05:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
um the we expect that this would not be
 
05:22:45.270 --> 05:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
an ex a significant extra administrative
 
05:22:48.548 --> 05:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
burden on the department um and so that
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
if there were uh you when we we get
 
05:22:52.670 --> 05:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
notification of failed subject systems
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
now we have um followup related to those
 
05:22:58.990 --> 05:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh this would add to that but not in a
 
05:23:00.948 --> 05:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
way that I think would require and
 
05:23:00.958 --> 05:23:02.430 align:start position:0%
way that I think would require and
additional

05:23:02.430 --> 05:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:23:07.390 --> 05:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:09.270 --> 05:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:23:11.470 --> 05:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
for my question H it's actually going to
 
05:23:13.670 --> 05:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
follow on to representative fails I was
 
05:23:15.030 --> 05:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to ask roughly what's the
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of of failed septic systems
 
05:23:21.868 --> 05:23:21.878 align:start position:0%
you think that the state has already um
 
05:23:25.230 --> 05:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
out there so I'm from Salem so we all
 
05:23:27.788 --> 05:23:27.798 align:start position:0%
know about Arlington Pond and I'm
 
05:23:29.628 --> 05:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
curious how many homeowners that this
 
05:23:32.788 --> 05:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
would actually affect across the state
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
um that they would need to start to look
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
at this
 
05:23:39.590 --> 05:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
cost it's a thank you for the very
 
05:23:42.110 --> 05:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
excellent question um one of my
 
05:23:43.470 --> 05:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
questions I've been asking since I
 
05:23:45.788 --> 05:23:45.798 align:start position:0%
started this job was just some basic
 
05:23:47.750 --> 05:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
intelligence regarding septic systems in
 
05:23:49.110 --> 05:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
the state we have all kinds of
 
05:23:50.510 --> 05:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
information about the wastewater
 
05:23:52.470 --> 05:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
treatment plants for that serve our
 
05:23:56.350 --> 05:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
municip our cities um but yet more than
 
05:23:58.430 --> 05:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
half of the state you know septic
 
05:24:00.948 --> 05:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
systems is their form of Wastewater
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
treatment uh but yet our our the
 
05:24:06.070 --> 05:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
information we have is related to the
 
05:24:08.708 --> 05:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
systems that we have permitted since
 
05:24:11.190 --> 05:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
1967 some of which have been replaced
 
05:24:13.230 --> 05:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
multiple times since then so you can't
 
05:24:15.150 --> 05:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
even just look at the number of permits
 
05:24:16.990 --> 05:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
we've issued to know even how many
 
05:24:20.470 --> 05:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
septic systems there are and or either
 
05:24:24.310 --> 05:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
age um so this is kind of what I've been
 
05:24:28.030 --> 05:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
interested in is what um you know how
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
many very very old systems at risk of
 
05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
failure are there out there and we
 
05:24:32.868 --> 05:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
really don't have an answer to that
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
question so it's a great question I'm
 
05:24:38.708 --> 05:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have it um I will say that
 
05:24:41.390 --> 05:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of our work is spent
 
05:24:44.708 --> 05:24:44.718 align:start position:0%
permitting new systems or replacement
 
05:24:48.670 --> 05:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
systems and that we deal with you know
 
05:24:56.030 --> 05:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
um in the order of 50 failed systems per
 
05:24:59.310 --> 05:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
year um however I should say that a lot
 
05:25:01.070 --> 05:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
of those failed systems are dealt with
 
05:25:02.548 --> 05:25:02.558 align:start position:0%
at the municipal level by the health
 
05:25:05.788 --> 05:25:05.798 align:start position:0%
officers they they have the most uh uh
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
far-reaching authority to deal with fail
 
05:25:10.110 --> 05:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
septic systems and we encourage them to
 
05:25:12.430 --> 05:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
to take that action themselves so we
 
05:25:16.430 --> 05:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:20.910 --> 05:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:23.190 --> 05:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
05:25:26.350 --> 05:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
har um thank you very much for your
 
05:25:30.270 --> 05:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
testimony um is that 50 failed Shoreline
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
septic systems
 
05:25:33.628 --> 05:25:33.638 align:start position:0%
correct no thank you for the question
 
05:25:35.830 --> 05:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
the clarification no it's 50 total 50
 
05:25:38.910 --> 05:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
total in the state yeah that that we are
 
05:25:40.830 --> 05:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
involved with that you were involved
 
05:25:43.708 --> 05:25:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:46.868 --> 05:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
much representative Derby thank you Mr
 
05:25:50.230 --> 05:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
chair um the section four of this bill
 
05:25:52.470 --> 05:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
sort of clarifies existing language
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
about notifying Dees um about a failed
 
05:25:59.670 --> 05:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh failed septic system um which makes
 
05:26:02.070 --> 05:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
sense but my real question is the
 
05:26:05.230 --> 05:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
existing you know law that says um that
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
the designer has to notify Dees um of
 
05:26:10.708 --> 05:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
the failures what do you do with that
 
05:26:14.030 --> 05:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
information if you if you learn of a
 
05:26:16.070 --> 05:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
failure um Scott would you like to
 
05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
handle this one sure um so most of the
 
05:26:21.150 --> 05:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
times that we hear of these failures are
 
05:26:23.150 --> 05:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
from the health officers um once a
 
05:26:24.788 --> 05:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
failed system has been identified it's
 
05:26:27.628 --> 05:26:27.638 align:start position:0%
up to the health officer to work with
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
that the owner of that structure
 
05:26:31.270 --> 05:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
residential structure building to either
 
05:26:34.030 --> 05:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
pump their tank um and stay in the house
 
05:26:37.110 --> 05:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
or if it's it's an egregious violation
 
05:26:39.708 --> 05:26:39.718 align:start position:0%
to vacate the structure um at which
 
05:26:41.868 --> 05:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
point a licensed designer will get
 
05:26:44.270 --> 05:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
involved and and design a new system a
 
05:26:47.070 --> 05:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
replac replacement system for them um
 
05:26:48.470 --> 05:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's a process that goes along with
 
05:26:50.590 --> 05:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
that but there's time frames associated
 
05:26:52.590 --> 05:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
with that process and typically it's a
 
05:26:55.750 --> 05:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
30-day design and review process and
 
05:26:58.230 --> 05:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
then they're given 90 days to replace it
 
05:27:00.548 --> 05:27:00.558 align:start position:0%
and they're allowed one 90day uh EX
 
05:27:03.788 --> 05:27:03.798 align:start position:0%
exension time frame to replace
 
05:27:06.310 --> 05:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
this and representative if I could add
 
05:27:08.670 --> 05:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
um we do have a few cases where you know
 
05:27:11.030 --> 05:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
we we go to enforcement to require
 
05:27:14.030 --> 05:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
someone to replace their system um you
 
05:27:18.628 --> 05:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:20.830 --> 05:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
willingly anyone else on the committee
 
05:27:22.070 --> 05:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:27:24.510 --> 05:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
question seeing
 
05:27:26.788 --> 05:27:26.798 align:start position:0%
none thank you very
 
05:27:29.110 --> 05:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much for your
 
05:27:33.110 --> 05:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
time thank you com
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh there's I think there was two people
 
05:27:40.750 --> 05:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
to Bob Quinn and Sarah Holland did you
 
05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:51.030 --> 05:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.350 --> 05:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
Realtors good afternoon my name is Bob
 
05:27:55.708 --> 05:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
Quinn I am the CEO of the New Hampshire
 
05:27:58.030 --> 05:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors I'm Sarah
 
05:27:59.350 --> 05:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
Holland I'm the vice chair of public
 
05:28:01.750 --> 05:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
policy for the New Hampshire of realter
 
05:28:03.310 --> 05:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
and first and foremost I wanted to take
 
05:28:05.548 --> 05:28:05.558 align:start position:0%
a moment to thank representative rung um
 
05:28:07.788 --> 05:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
she did reach out to the association
 
05:28:11.310 --> 05:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
last fall uh we engaged in a a lengthy
 
05:28:14.030 --> 05:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh very substantive conversation uh on
 
05:28:17.150 --> 05:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
on this issue which also then prompted
 
05:28:19.510 --> 05:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh the association to contact the
 
05:28:21.470 --> 05:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
05:28:22.670 --> 05:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
because I think that there's one thing
 
05:28:25.070 --> 05:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
that both Dees as well as the Realtor
 
05:28:28.110 --> 05:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
Association agree on is that the current
 
05:28:31.470 --> 05:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
statute is not working the way it was
 
05:28:34.110 --> 05:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
likely intended to work uh it is not
 
05:28:35.670 --> 05:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
working for buyers it's not working for
 
05:28:37.868 --> 05:28:37.878 align:start position:0%
Sellers and it's doing little to protect
 
05:28:41.030 --> 05:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh public Waters um so over the past
 
05:28:43.628 --> 05:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
month uh we have had some uh very
 
05:28:45.510 --> 05:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
productive good conversations with
 
05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
department environmental services again
 
05:28:51.110 --> 05:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank uh Mr trobridge for uh always U
 
05:28:52.628 --> 05:28:52.638 align:start position:0%
being available to answer questions and
 
05:28:54.548 --> 05:28:54.558 align:start position:0%
to work with us uh we had hope that
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps we'd have something to submit
 
05:28:57.948 --> 05:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
today we're not quite ready there uh but
 
05:28:59.910 --> 05:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
if there is a work session I'm confident
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
that we come together and present
 
05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
something to you whether or not it's for
 
05:29:05.788 --> 05:29:05.798 align:start position:0%
this bill or for a future legislative
 
05:29:07.868 --> 05:29:07.878 align:start position:0%
session um to resolve some of these
 
05:29:09.708 --> 05:29:09.718 align:start position:0%
issues because it is a priority for us
 
05:29:11.670 --> 05:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
as well in protecting the public Waters
 
05:29:13.350 --> 05:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
as well as ensuring that buyers and
 
05:29:16.708 --> 05:29:16.718 align:start position:0%
sellers have a smooth uh transaction and
 
05:29:17.548 --> 05:29:17.558 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to turn over to
 
05:29:19.190 --> 05:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
Sarah who can go over some of our
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
concerns with the specifics of the bill
 
05:29:20.878 --> 05:29:21.590 align:start position:0%
concerns with the specifics of the bill
as

05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:29:24.750 --> 05:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
written um thank you again um and I did
 
05:29:28.110 --> 05:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
want to point out that um I have sat on
 
05:29:29.868 --> 05:29:29.878 align:start position:0%
the Lakes management advisory committee
 
05:29:31.868 --> 05:29:31.878 align:start position:0%
and I was a part of the cyanobacteria
 
05:29:34.190 --> 05:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
advisory committee as well I not against
 
05:29:36.910 --> 05:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
public Waters um but in order to move
 
05:29:38.708 --> 05:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
the needle I think we can do this in a
 
05:29:40.868 --> 05:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
in a more efficient manner so I will
 
05:29:43.270 --> 05:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
quickly point out the sections um that
 
05:29:45.670 --> 05:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
and summarize our concerns there so in
 
05:29:45.680 --> 05:29:46.868 align:start position:0%
and summarize our concerns there so in
section

05:29:46.868 --> 05:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:29:49.350 --> 05:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
one the definition of developed
 
05:29:51.948 --> 05:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
Waterfront is changing to include
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
Parcels of land within 250 ft to bring
 
05:29:56.910 --> 05:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
it in line with Shoreland protection
 
05:30:00.430 --> 05:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
protection act which extends to 50 so
 
05:30:02.670 --> 05:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
does make sense however it would make
 
05:30:04.788 --> 05:30:04.798 align:start position:0%
more sense if that definition of
 
05:30:07.750 --> 05:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
developed Waterfront said septic systems
 
05:30:10.070 --> 05:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
not property because properties as you
 
05:30:12.350 --> 05:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire can be very vast
 
05:30:14.670 --> 05:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
so a property maybe has water Frontage
 
05:30:16.470 --> 05:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
but the septic system can be several
 
05:30:18.910 --> 05:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
Acres away from that Waterfront so we
 
05:30:21.788 --> 05:30:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:25.190 --> 05:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation number two in section two
 
05:30:27.510 --> 05:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
we do think some objective standard
 
05:30:29.750 --> 05:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
should be included so that if a town
 
05:30:33.990 --> 05:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
wants to um add more stringent standards
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they may be um that they may be
 
05:30:37.750 --> 05:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
required to present some sort of
 
05:30:41.110 --> 05:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
scientific standards explaining why de's
 
05:30:43.670 --> 05:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
standards are not adequate this is to
 
05:30:45.390 --> 05:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
ensure that the town ordinance is the
 
05:30:47.788 --> 05:30:47.798 align:start position:0%
result of environmental concern and not
 
05:30:51.150 --> 05:30:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:54.430 --> 05:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
development section three titled sewage
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
Disposal system site assessment study
 
05:31:00.230 --> 05:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
the bigest biggest issue here is that
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
section D states that a detailed septic
 
05:31:05.628 --> 05:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
evaluation needs to be performed by a
 
05:31:08.910 --> 05:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
septic system designer in New Hampshire
 
05:31:12.030 --> 05:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
septic evaluations the review of septic
 
05:31:15.030 --> 05:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
systems the digging up um of the tank
 
05:31:17.230 --> 05:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
and looking maybe perhaps with cameras
 
05:31:19.830 --> 05:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
at the system these are done um by
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
evaluators not
 
05:31:24.430 --> 05:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
designers so septic evaluators perform
 
05:31:26.948 --> 05:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
evaluations designers perform site
 
05:31:28.830 --> 05:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
assessments which are fairly
 
05:31:32.030 --> 05:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
non-invasive and again we think um we
 
05:31:35.310 --> 05:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
understand the sponsors and DS Dees um
 
05:31:37.030 --> 05:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
objective but there might be a better
 
05:31:40.390 --> 05:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
way here and then finally in section
 
05:31:42.990 --> 05:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
five relative to system
 
05:31:45.430 --> 05:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
failure this paragraph would prohibit
 
05:31:46.990 --> 05:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
the property from closing until the
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
system was repaired or replaced and as
 
05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor had mentioned she is open to
 
05:31:56.548 --> 05:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
um timelines relative to that but this
 
05:31:59.390 --> 05:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
um language is very similar almost
 
05:32:01.750 --> 05:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
identical to Massachusetts Title 5
 
05:32:03.868 --> 05:32:03.878 align:start position:0%
septic requirement which also prevents
 
05:32:07.830 --> 05:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
properties from transferring so um the
 
05:32:11.150 --> 05:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
cost and delay of closing um does little
 
05:32:13.510 --> 05:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
to prevent the contamination into water
 
05:32:15.310 --> 05:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
bodies so we think there is another way
 
05:32:18.110 --> 05:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
to go about this um
 
05:32:20.590 --> 05:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
but to bring you into a buyer
 
05:32:22.590 --> 05:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
perspective most buyers unless they are
 
05:32:25.750 --> 05:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
going to um completely demolish and
 
05:32:28.548 --> 05:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
start over um they are likely not going
 
05:32:30.910 --> 05:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
to want to proceed and will either
 
05:32:33.270 --> 05:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
request the seller to replace or remedy
 
05:32:35.070 --> 05:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
the tank or they will exit the
 
05:32:37.110 --> 05:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
transaction in which the seller now has
 
05:32:39.390 --> 05:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
an obligation to share this information
 
05:32:42.510 --> 05:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
going forward with any party um
 
05:32:46.470 --> 05:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
so what our language does in this bill
 
05:32:50.190 --> 05:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
or the language in the bill does is also
 
05:32:52.110 --> 05:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
eliminates relative to Massachusetts
 
05:32:55.628 --> 05:32:55.638 align:start position:0%
Title 5 um it eliminates any sort of
 
05:32:59.390 --> 05:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
financial assistance um for the property
 
05:33:01.708 --> 05:33:01.718 align:start position:0%
owner um who may not have known that
 
05:33:03.510 --> 05:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
their property their septic system was
 
05:33:07.110 --> 05:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
in Failure um and now is now required to
 
05:33:08.830 --> 05:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
replace it which can be tens of
 
05:33:13.230 --> 05:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars so um as uh Bob had
 
05:33:15.110 --> 05:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned we are in conversations with
 
05:33:20.470 --> 05:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
Dees and do um hope to come to um some
 
05:33:22.430 --> 05:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
some agreement on some of these things
 
05:33:25.110 --> 05:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
that actually do move the Needle happy
 
05:33:27.350 --> 05:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
05:33:29.548 --> 05:33:29.558 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by members of
 
05:33:30.750 --> 05:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:33:33.910 --> 05:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bale followed by
 
05:33:33.920 --> 05:33:35.510 align:start position:0%

05:33:42.548 --> 05:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
else um thank you Mr chair I'm just
 
05:33:44.110 --> 05:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
um you said um about the amendment so
 
05:33:50.910 --> 05:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
you would be open to an amendment on the
 
05:33:56.110 --> 05:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
yes representative l

yes representative l

05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:04.350 --> 05:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr shair and thank you for
 
05:34:06.910 --> 05:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um are there buyers
 
05:34:09.430 --> 05:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
of shorel properties now that are waving
 
05:34:11.990 --> 05:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
inspections of the septic that you
 
05:34:15.990 --> 05:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
know so that it does happen um it is
 
05:34:18.310 --> 05:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
generally not the norm in the situations
 
05:34:21.470 --> 05:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
in which it is happening it is generally
 
05:34:24.070 --> 05:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
a buyer that has the means to do any
 
05:34:26.510 --> 05:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
replacement of those systems so they're
 
05:34:29.310 --> 05:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
not finding it to be a financial concern
 
05:34:32.470 --> 05:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:34.510 --> 05:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
a followup or
 
05:34:37.510 --> 05:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
followup and with regards to the
 
05:34:40.510 --> 05:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
massachusett law U do you feel that if
 
05:34:43.310 --> 05:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
we did have an amendment to say to give
 
05:34:43.320 --> 05:34:44.190 align:start position:0%
we did have an amendment to say to give
the

05:34:44.190 --> 05:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
seller if they discover that they're
 
05:34:48.788 --> 05:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
buying a interested in buying a property
 
05:34:51.628 --> 05:34:51.638 align:start position:0%
with a failed septic that the seller
 
05:34:55.150 --> 05:34:55.160 align:start position:0%
would have six months to repair the
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
septic system that would take the
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
pressure off I mean the I'm sorry the
 
05:35:04.070 --> 05:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
Buy would then um have six months to fix
 
05:35:05.708 --> 05:35:05.718 align:start position:0%
it that would take the pressure off the
 
05:35:07.830 --> 05:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
seller being forced to come up with the
 
05:35:09.628 --> 05:35:09.638 align:start position:0%
month advance in order to the for the
 
05:35:11.910 --> 05:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
property to be sold it could be a
 
05:35:14.150 --> 05:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
consideration for stakeholders I think
 
05:35:18.990 --> 05:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
the concern there is um if if that's
 
05:35:20.510 --> 05:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
something that the buyer is in agreement
 
05:35:22.270 --> 05:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
with that's great if the buyer is not in
 
05:35:23.830 --> 05:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
agreement with it then the seller still
 
05:35:25.510 --> 05:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
retains the property and still has the
 
05:35:27.310 --> 05:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
septic system that they now have
 
05:35:29.548 --> 05:35:29.558 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that needs to be replaced
 
05:35:35.390 --> 05:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:38.350 --> 05:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
situation Kelly the
 
05:35:42.670 --> 05:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
next no representative harb is after you
 
05:35:44.948 --> 05:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
representative harb then repres thank
 
05:35:47.590 --> 05:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
you um thank you for taking my question
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
um title five as I understand it in
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because I'm a
 
05:35:53.788 --> 05:35:53.798 align:start position:0%
transactional attorney says that the
 
05:35:56.548 --> 05:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
seller has to do the inspection but
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
there can be negotiated between the
 
05:36:01.110 --> 05:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
seller and the buyer who does the repair
 
05:36:03.510 --> 05:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
and the upgrade and I believe it gives
 
05:36:06.310 --> 05:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
them a year does the board of realtors
 
05:36:09.470 --> 05:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
do you have any suggestion or any
 
05:36:11.590 --> 05:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
opinions regarding how long someone
 
05:36:13.350 --> 05:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
should have whether it's the buyer or
 
05:36:17.590 --> 05:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:19.868 --> 05:36:19.878 align:start position:0%
system without speaking with my
 
05:36:23.190 --> 05:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in this moment I I like the
 
05:36:25.390 --> 05:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
idea of the latitude of either party
 
05:36:27.788 --> 05:36:27.798 align:start position:0%
instead of a mandate on one or the other
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and understanding our season
 
05:36:32.990 --> 05:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
the longer the amount of time the
 
05:36:36.110 --> 05:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
better thank
 
05:36:39.590 --> 05:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
you of Derby thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:36:41.310 --> 05:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm wondering
 
05:36:46.430 --> 05:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
if the um Realtors see um concern from
 
05:36:48.750 --> 05:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
potential buyers about
 
05:36:52.910 --> 05:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and eoli um closures to
 
05:36:55.190 --> 05:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
Lake to lakefront properties which are
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
happening more and more across the
 
05:37:01.868 --> 05:37:01.878 align:start position:0%
state think the health of the water body
 
05:37:03.948 --> 05:37:03.958 align:start position:0%
when buyers are looking to purchase
 
05:37:08.270 --> 05:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
property is part of their diligence in
 
05:37:11.750 --> 05:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:13.948 --> 05:37:13.958 align:start position:0%

yes representative Kelly then
representative

05:37:15.470 --> 05:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:37:17.628 --> 05:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
Bale thank you Mr chair I had two
 
05:37:19.030 --> 05:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
questions and I was hoping someone else
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
would ask one so I only had to ask
 
05:37:25.750 --> 05:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
one I get questions very easy so uh my
 
05:37:28.070 --> 05:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
first question like uh can you guys give
 
05:37:30.628 --> 05:37:30.638 align:start position:0%
us some idea about uh
 
05:37:33.190 --> 05:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of like this like let's say a
 
05:37:34.990 --> 05:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
seller selling a property they find a
 
05:37:37.150 --> 05:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
broken septic system do we have any
 
05:37:39.830 --> 05:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
numbers on cost of like a quick septic
 
05:37:44.788 --> 05:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:49.708 --> 05:37:49.718 align:start position:0%
transaction so this this is not my my um
 
05:37:51.990 --> 05:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
area of expertise but what I have
 
05:37:54.990 --> 05:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
observed in in my career is it kind of
 
05:37:58.510 --> 05:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
runs the gamut right so something like
 
05:37:58.520 --> 05:38:01.628 align:start position:0%
runs the gamut right so something like
um

05:38:01.628 --> 05:38:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:04.948 --> 05:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
uh an old dbox that is um maybe
 
05:38:07.750 --> 05:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
crumbling and needs to have a um a new
 
05:38:10.110 --> 05:38:10.120 align:start position:0%
poured concrete box around it couple
 
05:38:12.430 --> 05:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar easy fix complete
 
05:38:14.708 --> 05:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
replacement of a septic system to bring
 
05:38:16.350 --> 05:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
in a designer to go through the
 
05:38:18.310 --> 05:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
permitting process and then to have it
 
05:38:21.750 --> 05:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
installed those are so those are three
 
05:38:24.230 --> 05:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
parties for if you include Dees that are
 
05:38:26.948 --> 05:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
involved in that the evaluator the
 
05:38:29.750 --> 05:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
designer and the installer um that could
 
05:38:33.350 --> 05:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
be upwards of $50,000 or more depending
 
05:38:37.468 --> 05:38:37.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:39.990 --> 05:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
property a followup followup and then my
 
05:38:42.350 --> 05:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
second question followup this question
 
05:38:44.310 --> 05:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
second question I'll ask a followup
 
05:38:45.910 --> 05:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
first then I'll ask for a permission
 
05:38:48.030 --> 05:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
from the chair so so the followup to
 
05:38:50.030 --> 05:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
that is is you know we're talking short
 
05:38:52.110 --> 05:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
front property you know and we're
 
05:38:56.270 --> 05:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
talking 2023 so you know do we have how
 
05:38:59.670 --> 05:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
about a number about the median house
 
05:39:01.310 --> 05:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
price sale price on a shorefront
 
05:39:04.390 --> 05:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
property so we need to be careful when
 
05:39:06.350 --> 05:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
we think about shorefront because I
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
think a lot of the times we're thinking
 
05:39:10.510 --> 05:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
about Lake winnipauk multi-million
 
05:39:14.310 --> 05:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
dollar homes this provision um of
 
05:39:17.628 --> 05:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
developed waterfront property is along
 
05:39:19.868 --> 05:39:19.878 align:start position:0%
um any body of water great ponds that
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
are 10 acres or more fourth order
 
05:39:25.590 --> 05:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
greater Rivers um and tidal waters so
 
05:39:28.910 --> 05:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
that could very rural properties so the
 
05:39:33.430 --> 05:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
costs replace a septic system is can be
 
05:39:36.788 --> 05:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
um that where they had no intention or
 
05:39:38.110 --> 05:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
even understanding that they were
 
05:39:40.390 --> 05:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
considered you know kind of a developed
 
05:39:42.750 --> 05:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
waterfront property um can be
 
05:39:46.150 --> 05:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:49.468 --> 05:39:49.478 align:start position:0%
owner I appreciate it coming from burin
 
05:39:52.590 --> 05:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
I totally get that it's the definitely
 
05:39:54.310 --> 05:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
the I was I was guilty of the BL winter
 
05:39:57.430 --> 05:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
Baki thing okay question quick quick one
 
05:40:00.430 --> 05:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
more question about
 
05:40:03.030 --> 05:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
all right it's it's it's only your
 
05:40:06.390 --> 05:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:09.548 --> 05:40:09.558 align:start position:0%
blocking the second question unrelated
 
05:40:11.548 --> 05:40:11.558 align:start position:0%
is this this debate over septic
 
05:40:12.948 --> 05:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
installers versus evaluators because
 
05:40:14.190 --> 05:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
we've had that before been in this
 
05:40:15.990 --> 05:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee for three years now four years
 
05:40:18.510 --> 05:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
now that's something we hear a lot so
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
can you detail the difference between
 
05:40:21.868 --> 05:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
the two my understanding was the
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
installer the evaluators were a
 
05:40:29.110 --> 05:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
private process versus the designer was
 
05:40:34.628 --> 05:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
a a Dees run program but it could be so
 
05:40:39.350 --> 05:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
my again outside of my scope but um my
 
05:40:41.230 --> 05:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is one person can be all
 
05:40:45.990 --> 05:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
three right um but that the eval the
 
05:40:48.468 --> 05:40:48.478 align:start position:0%
septic system evaluators fall under oplc
 
05:40:50.910 --> 05:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
and their licensing and the designers
 
05:40:53.110 --> 05:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
fall under the purview of Dees so they
 
05:40:55.390 --> 05:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
have two very different functions but I
 
05:40:57.310 --> 05:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
think it's also important just to
 
05:40:59.510 --> 05:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
clarify that what we're talking about in
 
05:41:01.628 --> 05:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
this legislation currently and the
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
statute it's uh the septic designers
 
05:41:06.708 --> 05:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
which are doing the site assessments and
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
those are
 
05:41:10.468 --> 05:41:10.478 align:start position:0%
mandated I think it is fair to say and
 
05:41:11.990 --> 05:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
Sarah Will C me if I'm wrong that in
 
05:41:15.070 --> 05:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
almost every transaction that occurs the
 
05:41:19.110 --> 05:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
buyer also has a septic evaluation done
 
05:41:21.628 --> 05:41:21.638 align:start position:0%
and the septic evaluation I think is and
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
I think that there's some agreement on
 
05:41:26.590 --> 05:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
this uh among the parties is going to
 
05:41:28.750 --> 05:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
provide a lot more information about
 
05:41:30.390 --> 05:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not not the system is
 
05:41:32.510 --> 05:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
operational and functioning properly or
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
not um than a site assessment does so
 
05:41:38.110 --> 05:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
that's kind of one of the areas that we
 
05:41:42.270 --> 05:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:45.868 --> 05:41:45.878 align:start position:0%
improve representative V thank you Mr
 
05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
05:41:50.110 --> 05:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
question are there buyers purchasing
 
05:41:52.030 --> 05:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
Shoreland property and waving
 
05:41:55.670 --> 05:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
inspections right now that you know of
 
05:41:58.350 --> 05:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that does happen it does happen it
 
05:41:59.948 --> 05:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
it's generally not the norm and
 
05:42:01.670 --> 05:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
definitely in this market where things
 
05:42:04.270 --> 05:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
have changed over the last 12 months um
 
05:42:06.750 --> 05:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing a return of folks
 
05:42:08.788 --> 05:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
holding on to those buyer rights to be
 
05:42:13.110 --> 05:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
able to do those um in in past markets
 
05:42:15.590 --> 05:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
like we saw throughout the pandemic um
 
05:42:18.750 --> 05:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
it was generally a a competition um
 
05:42:21.310 --> 05:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
scenario where in order to obtain the
 
05:42:23.190 --> 05:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
property get it under contract that they
 
05:42:24.990 --> 05:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
needed to wave those not that they
 
05:42:30.270 --> 05:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up or a followup
 
05:42:32.590 --> 05:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
um so a
 
05:42:37.110 --> 05:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
buyer a buyer can um purchase a property
 
05:42:40.150 --> 05:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
that has a failed septic system as it is
 
05:42:43.750 --> 05:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
right now correct thank you remind the
 
05:42:46.310 --> 05:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
committee we've got 15 minutes left and
 
05:42:51.190 --> 05:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
I have the cards
 
05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh I think I see no more
 
05:42:57.948 --> 05:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:00.310 --> 05:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
05:43:14.708 --> 05:43:14.718 align:start position:0%

would I'm just going to build upon
 
05:43:46.948 --> 05:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
recognizing um we're been here a while
 
05:43:49.310 --> 05:43:49.320 align:start position:0%

with all the reasons they've expressed
 
05:43:58.230 --> 05:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
for why um this is a good idea one thing
 
05:43:59.830 --> 05:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to share with with you uh
 
05:44:02.830 --> 05:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
today is on January 3rd of this year I
 
05:44:05.788 --> 05:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
testified in front of the Senate finance
 
05:44:08.750 --> 05:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee on what Bill number was I've
 
05:44:11.788 --> 05:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
been to a lot so far um s SP
 
05:44:16.110 --> 05:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
394 this bill appropriates 1 million to
 
05:44:16.120 --> 05:44:16.830 align:start position:0%
394 this bill appropriates 1 million to
the

05:44:16.830 --> 05:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:44:19.230 --> 05:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria uh mitigation Grant and
 
05:44:22.990 --> 05:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund and this I know is a uh a fund
 
05:44:24.708 --> 05:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
that this committee was supportive last
 
05:44:27.230 --> 05:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
year and and it eventually got included
 
05:44:28.948 --> 05:44:28.958 align:start position:0%
um into the state budget but we won't go
 
05:44:31.990 --> 05:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
go into that but I so I spoke in support
 
05:44:33.948 --> 05:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
of this appropriation and they asked me
 
05:44:36.750 --> 05:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
a number of questions um doing their due
 
05:44:38.590 --> 05:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
deligence but one of the questions they
 
05:44:41.030 --> 05:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
asked me is and I'm going to paraphrase
 
05:44:42.590 --> 05:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit here they
 
05:44:44.548 --> 05:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
said you know we're we're a little
 
05:44:46.788 --> 05:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable continuing to give money
 
05:44:50.150 --> 05:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
to this fund if there isn't things being
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
done there aren't thing things being
 
05:44:54.390 --> 05:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
done that are really getting at reducing
 
05:44:56.830 --> 05:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
the sources of this pollution that's
 
05:44:59.830 --> 05:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
contributing to these cyanobacteria s
 
05:45:01.030 --> 05:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
and I said well thank you so much for
 
05:45:03.788 --> 05:45:03.798 align:start position:0%
asking this question and I was pleased
 
05:45:05.150 --> 05:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
to let them know that there are a
 
05:45:07.868 --> 05:45:07.878 align:start position:0%
handful of bills being considered in the
 
05:45:10.390 --> 05:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
legislature this session that are a
 
05:45:12.670 --> 05:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
direct result of the
 
05:45:16.270 --> 05:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria um Advisory Group that
 
05:45:19.390 --> 05:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
helped to Dees produce the CYO bacteria
 
05:45:22.070 --> 05:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
plan and this and they specifically
 
05:45:23.830 --> 05:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
asked me what are we doing about
 
05:45:26.110 --> 05:45:26.120 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and I let them what what are
 
05:45:29.548 --> 05:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
we doing about septic systems and um
 
05:45:32.230 --> 05:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
so when I mentioned to them that there's
 
05:45:35.110 --> 05:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
this bill um and that there's you know
 
05:45:37.990 --> 05:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
an attempt to uh reduce the septic
 
05:45:40.590 --> 05:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
system pollution uh to our Lakes which
 
05:45:42.910 --> 05:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
contributes to these cyanobacteria bills
 
05:45:44.230 --> 05:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
they were encouraged there were other
 
05:45:46.788 --> 05:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
bills fertilizer Bill and another of of
 
05:45:49.948 --> 05:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
them but I can understand not wanting to
 
05:45:51.990 --> 05:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
throw you know more and more money at
 
05:45:54.670 --> 05:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
this fund to help Lake
 
05:45:57.270 --> 05:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
Associations remediate these blooms if
 
05:45:59.310 --> 05:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
we as a state aren't wor working
 
05:46:01.510 --> 05:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
together to reduce the sources of this
 
05:46:04.150 --> 05:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
pollution so I'm really encouraged today
 
05:46:06.350 --> 05:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
to hear that um you know the various
 
05:46:09.468 --> 05:46:09.478 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in this room are interested
 
05:46:11.788 --> 05:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
in working together I heard that you
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
know we all agree that the current
 
05:46:16.548 --> 05:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
system is is not working when a Property
 
05:46:18.350 --> 05:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
Transfers hands it's not very
 
05:46:20.270 --> 05:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
informative um it's certainly not
 
05:46:23.430 --> 05:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
protective of water quality
 
05:46:26.708 --> 05:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
so I really urge this committee um
 
05:46:28.150 --> 05:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully in work session and with
 
05:46:30.868 --> 05:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
potential amend M ments to really it as
 
05:46:32.830 --> 05:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
representative rung said this issue of
 
05:46:34.990 --> 05:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
septic systems has come up again and
 
05:46:37.310 --> 05:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
again and again and we can't wait any
 
05:46:39.708 --> 05:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
longer our Lakes are having more and
 
05:46:42.150 --> 05:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
more cyanobacteria blooms we've got to
 
05:46:45.670 --> 05:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
do something for public health for our
 
05:46:48.190 --> 05:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
investments along our Lakes for our
 
05:46:52.030 --> 05:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
economy uh for recreation for tourism so
 
05:46:54.948 --> 05:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
I urge you to uh support this bill in a
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
way that the the the various groups in
 
05:47:00.230 --> 05:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
this room can um work together on an
 
05:47:02.590 --> 05:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that will actually result in
 
05:47:03.990 --> 05:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
some positive
 
05:47:06.070 --> 05:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
change and with that i' would be happy
 
05:47:07.468 --> 05:47:07.478 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
05:47:10.468 --> 05:47:10.478 align:start position:0%
questions I have BL first are you saying
 
05:47:13.590 --> 05:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
that the Senate hasn't read the cyano
 
05:47:15.990 --> 05:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
bacteria plan I made sure that they had
 
05:47:20.110 --> 05:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
a copy of it God after all the work we
 
05:47:22.270 --> 05:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
did I made sure they knew about it thank
 
05:47:25.868 --> 05:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
you uh repres representative
 
05:47:28.310 --> 05:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
Bale I just wanted to say thank you for
 
05:47:31.750 --> 05:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
staying on the cause here and I'm just
 
05:47:33.948 --> 05:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
sitting here in front of my report from
 
05:47:36.430 --> 05:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Shoreland septic
 
05:47:38.708 --> 05:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
system study commission which produced
 
05:47:41.350 --> 05:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
this report four years ago and I'm glad
 
05:47:43.468 --> 05:47:43.478 align:start position:0%
that we're here today looking at what we
 
05:47:46.670 --> 05:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
can do this um at the time this report
 
05:47:49.110 --> 05:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
was released there were 65 impaired
 
05:47:52.110 --> 05:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
lakes and I'm curious to find out if we
 
05:47:57.628 --> 05:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:57.638 --> 05:48:00.030 align:start position:0%
 
now

05:48:00.030 --> 05:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:48:01.830 --> 05:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question and uh
 
05:48:04.030 --> 05:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
if if you're specific lakes that are
 
05:48:07.030 --> 05:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
impaired for water quality reasons um I
 
05:48:09.430 --> 05:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
don't know that specific information and
 
05:48:11.070 --> 05:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
and certainly I could get that to you
 
05:48:13.230 --> 05:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
from Dees or perhaps someone from Dees
 
05:48:16.190 --> 05:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
in the room has that information
 
05:48:18.070 --> 05:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
today so
 
05:48:24.270 --> 05:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.350 --> 05:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
next there any other questions
 
05:48:30.230 --> 05:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
any see seeing none thank you very much
 
05:48:30.240 --> 05:48:31.628 align:start position:0%
any see seeing none thank you very much
thank

05:48:31.628 --> 05:48:31.638 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:48:34.708 --> 05:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
you uh Glenn

05:48:50.230 --> 05:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
Pond thanks very much for uh letting me
 
05:48:54.628 --> 05:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
say a few words um we uhu I do represent
 
05:48:57.788 --> 05:48:57.798 align:start position:0%
uh the friends of Haro Pond which is uh
 
05:48:59.310 --> 05:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
very informal
 
05:48:59.320 --> 05:49:00.830 align:start position:0%
very informal
Lake

05:49:00.830 --> 05:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
Lake
 
05:49:04.670 --> 05:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
Association uh back in 2017 we did have
 
05:49:07.990 --> 05:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
a cyano bacteria Bloom and that's when
 
05:49:11.390 --> 05:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh our organization uh started to U
 
05:49:12.990 --> 05:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
think about what kinds of things we
 
05:49:15.430 --> 05:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
might we might do and we we worked with
 
05:49:18.510 --> 05:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of Environmental
 
05:49:21.390 --> 05:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
Services uh we did a septic system
 
05:49:25.190 --> 05:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
survey of the 25 properties around uh
 
05:49:29.788 --> 05:49:29.798 align:start position:0%
our little Pond um and uh we also worked
 
05:49:32.948 --> 05:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Lakes um and an
 
05:49:35.670 --> 05:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
application for our property to be to be
 
05:49:38.788 --> 05:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
Lakes smart and as a result of that we
 
05:49:41.350 --> 05:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
had a septic system
 
05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
evaluator which was very
 
05:49:46.548 --> 05:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
helpful and not very
 
05:49:49.628 --> 05:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
expensive two2 200
 
05:49:53.948 --> 05:49:53.958 align:start position:0%
$250 and they uh U noticed that there
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
were three small improvements that
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
needed to be done to the system um and
 
05:50:03.670 --> 05:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh we had that done for again a fairly
 
05:50:06.430 --> 05:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
modest amount of money we did not have a
 
05:50:10.510 --> 05:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
designer uh work with us uh we uh
 
05:50:13.150 --> 05:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
inquired about a designer they're much
 
05:50:13.160 --> 05:50:14.310 align:start position:0%
inquired about a designer they're much
more

05:50:14.310 --> 05:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:50:17.230 --> 05:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
expensive uh than an evaluator and the
 
05:50:19.910 --> 05:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
evaluator that we had did a really
 
05:50:22.948 --> 05:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
wonderful job of specifically telling us
 
05:50:26.510 --> 05:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
what the three um things we could do to
 
05:50:29.628 --> 05:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
make our septic system full fully
 
05:50:33.190 --> 05:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
operational so uh to have those kinds of
 
05:50:36.628 --> 05:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
evaluations not necessarily a designer I
 
05:50:40.270 --> 05:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
think uh when someone uh is in process
 
05:50:43.350 --> 05:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
of of uh selling their property just
 
05:50:45.788 --> 05:50:45.798 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense to us and I'm sure
 
05:50:48.788 --> 05:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
many of our small Lake Associations
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
would see that as making a lot of sense
 
05:50:52.910 --> 05:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
to improve the environmental health of
 
05:50:55.310 --> 05:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
our of our ponds it just makes a lot of
 
05:50:59.030 --> 05:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
common sense uh so I I certainly uh
 
05:51:01.070 --> 05:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
would support this bill and would be
 
05:51:03.708 --> 05:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions you might
 
05:51:06.190 --> 05:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
have questions for members of the
 
05:51:08.590 --> 05:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
05:51:12.030 --> 05:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
much thank you Pat tarpy from Lake
 
05:51:12.040 --> 05:51:21.430 align:start position:0%

05:51:21.430 --> 05:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:23.830 --> 05:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
Association thank you members of the
 
05:51:25.548 --> 05:51:25.558 align:start position:0%

05:51:27.150 --> 05:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
Lake Winn basaki
 
05:51:30.030 --> 05:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
Association um I want to speak
 
05:51:32.590 --> 05:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
specifically to a septic system
 
05:51:35.548 --> 05:51:35.558 align:start position:0%
Improvement program that we ran several
 
05:51:38.030 --> 05:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
years back which might answer some of
 
05:51:41.430 --> 05:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
the questions I heard here earlier um we
 
05:51:44.350 --> 05:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
worked with the town of Meredith who
 
05:51:48.230 --> 05:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to adopt a health regulation to
 
05:51:51.110 --> 05:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
address septic systems within 250 ft of
 
05:51:55.548 --> 05:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
Lake wuan it took over 10 years to get
 
05:51:57.670 --> 05:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
that Health ordinance passed there was a
 
05:52:01.070 --> 05:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
lot of educ done but at the time Lin
 
05:52:04.430 --> 05:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
abaki Association obtained two grants uh
 
05:52:06.548 --> 05:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
one from the source water protection
 
05:52:10.110 --> 05:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
program and one through Dees 319 program
 
05:52:12.670 --> 05:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
the first through the source waterer was
 
05:52:14.910 --> 05:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
because walk youan is a drinking water
 
05:52:17.190 --> 05:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
source for the business community of
 
05:52:19.030 --> 05:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
Meredith as well as some
 
05:52:21.830 --> 05:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
residents and Meredith had done some
 
05:52:24.990 --> 05:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
investigation and they realized there
 
05:52:27.310 --> 05:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
were many properties that didn't have
 
05:52:29.868 --> 05:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
operational approvals and that were very
 
05:52:32.868 --> 05:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
old and with and within the 250 ft
 
05:52:32.878 --> 05:52:34.070 align:start position:0%
old and with and within the 250 ft
shorel

05:52:34.070 --> 05:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
shorel
 
05:52:39.110 --> 05:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
Zone um we did a caare program to have
 
05:52:42.788 --> 05:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
and we hired one US licensed septic
 
05:52:45.390 --> 05:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
system evaluator who conducted all the
 
05:52:48.190 --> 05:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
evaluations so as Apples to Apples we
 
05:52:51.310 --> 05:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
opened it up to any property over 25
 
05:52:54.430 --> 05:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
years old so they didn't have to have
 
05:52:56.230 --> 05:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
they could have an operational approval
 
05:52:57.670 --> 05:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
or whatever and they didn't even have to
 
05:53:00.190 --> 05:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
be subject to Meredith Health ordinance
 
05:53:02.750 --> 05:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
because we opened it up to New Hampton
 
05:53:05.468 --> 05:53:05.478 align:start position:0%
and Center Harbor which also border
 
05:53:08.750 --> 05:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
wyan I can tell you and I have numbers
 
05:53:11.390 --> 05:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
and I submitted this testimony there
 
05:53:11.400 --> 05:53:12.510 align:start position:0%
and I submitted this testimony there
were

05:53:12.510 --> 05:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
183 um shorefront properties within that
 
05:53:19.750 --> 05:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
250 foot Zone
 
05:53:21.670 --> 05:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
95 which is
 
05:53:24.510 --> 05:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
52% had systems that were installed
 
05:53:27.310 --> 05:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
prior to 1988 which would make them 25
 
05:53:29.110 --> 05:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
years old or old older at the time we
 
05:53:30.468 --> 05:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
did this
 
05:53:34.150 --> 05:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
program uh it was a voluntary program 29
 
05:53:36.628 --> 05:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
evaluations were
 
05:53:41.230 --> 05:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
conducted and of the 29 18 systems were
 
05:53:44.670 --> 05:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
found to be in failure that's 62% of
 
05:53:44.680 --> 05:53:45.750 align:start position:0%
found to be in failure that's 62% of
those

05:53:45.750 --> 05:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:53:49.110 --> 05:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
evaluated we had the second uh grant
 
05:53:51.310 --> 05:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
program was which was a c share program
 
05:53:53.468 --> 05:53:53.478 align:start position:0%
and let me just say the evaluations cost
 
05:53:56.350 --> 05:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
500 our grant paid 250 the property
 
05:53:58.990 --> 05:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
owner paid 250
 
05:54:02.910 --> 05:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
um we had a second Grant which for those
 
05:54:04.910 --> 05:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
properties found in Failure we would
 
05:54:07.990 --> 05:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
provide cost share up to $4,000 to
 
05:54:09.590 --> 05:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
repair or
 
05:54:13.628 --> 05:54:13.638 align:start position:0%
replace so we also through our watershed
 
05:54:16.548 --> 05:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
management plans we do a septic system
 
05:54:20.030 --> 05:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
risk analysis so we we look at we get
 
05:54:22.830 --> 05:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
all the properties within 250 feet of
 
05:54:26.468 --> 05:54:26.478 align:start position:0%
the area we're studying and we base it
 
05:54:28.590 --> 05:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
are they seasonal are they year around
 
05:54:30.310 --> 05:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
what's the age of the
 
05:54:32.628 --> 05:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
building which is not necessarily
 
05:54:35.868 --> 05:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
indicative of the septic but right now
 
05:54:38.230 --> 05:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
we're doing wolfboro Bay and I can tell
 
05:54:41.030 --> 05:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
you there are 284 Parcels that fall
 
05:54:43.070 --> 05:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
within that 250t
 
05:54:48.468 --> 05:54:48.478 align:start position:0%
boundary 21 of them that's 74% are 25
 
05:54:51.190 --> 05:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
years or older the
 
05:54:54.510 --> 05:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
buildings most of these properties at
 
05:54:57.788 --> 05:54:57.798 align:start position:0%
least on wiip are seasonal second
 
05:54:59.750 --> 05:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
home s
 
05:55:02.910 --> 05:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking age is very indicative
 
05:55:04.948 --> 05:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
of the age of the septic but we have
 
05:55:07.110 --> 05:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
found through what we've done age of the
 
05:55:09.310 --> 05:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
septic is the number one factor
 
05:55:11.070 --> 05:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
determining factor of whether the system
 
05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
is going to be in Failure we support
 
05:55:16.590 --> 05:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
this bill um and we urge you to pass
 
05:55:19.510 --> 05:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
this and I'll take any
 
05:55:21.670 --> 05:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from members of
 
05:55:25.628 --> 05:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none very
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
much last uh the last uh card I have uh
 
05:55:31.520 --> 05:55:32.868 align:start position:0%
much last uh the last uh card I have uh

05:55:42.350 --> 05:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
Foundation thank you so much thank you
 
05:55:44.590 --> 05:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to thank turn it on
 
05:55:46.310 --> 05:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
there we go that's better thank you so
 
05:55:48.670 --> 05:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
much to the committee um for giving me a
 
05:55:50.390 --> 05:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
moment to make some comments my name is
 
05:55:52.708 --> 05:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
Melissa paly I'm the Great Bay piscatqua
 
05:55:55.110 --> 05:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
Water keeper with conservation law
 
05:55:57.590 --> 05:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
foundation and um I know a lot of the
 
05:55:59.788 --> 05:55:59.798 align:start position:0%
folus here and a lot of the proponents
 
05:56:02.310 --> 05:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
of this uh represent uh
 
05:56:05.150 --> 05:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
freshwater um interests the Lakes
 
05:56:07.548 --> 05:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
Association and so on and it's fantastic
 
05:56:09.510 --> 05:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
to see so many people turning out I want
 
05:56:11.750 --> 05:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
to put a word in for the coastal part of
 
05:56:15.548 --> 05:56:15.558 align:start position:0%
the state um and uh the saltwater end of
 
05:56:18.788 --> 05:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh which is equally uh
 
05:56:21.750 --> 05:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
threatened by um pollution from septic
 
05:56:24.190 --> 05:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
systems and it's the reason why I felt
 
05:56:26.430 --> 05:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
it was important to come out and support
 
05:56:28.430 --> 05:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
this uh bill which I think is is a very
 
05:56:32.830 --> 05:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
small but important step um toward uh
 
05:56:36.110 --> 05:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
protecting uh New Hampshire's uh Water
 
05:56:39.788 --> 05:56:39.798 align:start position:0%
Resources um as I mentioned uh I commend
 
05:56:41.310 --> 05:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
the committee for recognizing the
 
05:56:43.230 --> 05:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
serious impact of septic systems on
 
05:56:45.868 --> 05:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
water quality and ecosystem Health um
 
05:56:49.270 --> 05:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
and as uh representative Vale noted um
 
05:56:52.670 --> 05:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
nearly three well three and three and a
 
05:56:55.110 --> 05:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
half years ago after a year of study uh
 
05:56:57.110 --> 05:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
Judith spangs representative spangs
 
05:56:58.590 --> 05:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
legislative study Commission on
 
05:57:02.030 --> 05:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
Shoreland septic systems um uh submitted
 
05:57:04.230 --> 05:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
a final report I was a member of that
 
05:57:07.670 --> 05:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
commission um and we had a a slew of
 
05:57:10.030 --> 05:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of that
 
05:57:12.150 --> 05:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
that recognized that both nitrogen and
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
phosphorus uh from septic systems uh
 
05:57:16.910 --> 05:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
negatively impact freshwater in uh
 
05:57:21.390 --> 05:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
Coastal rivers and Bays um so uh but let
 
05:57:23.390 --> 05:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
me focus on the Sea Coast for a minute
 
05:57:25.510 --> 05:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
where I focus my efforts to to protect
 
05:57:27.468 --> 05:57:27.478 align:start position:0%
and restore the health of the Great Bay
 
05:57:30.150 --> 05:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
um Estuary nitrogen pollution from
 
05:57:33.190 --> 05:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
septic systems is a very serious concern
 
05:57:36.230 --> 05:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
um according to the 2018 state of our
 
05:57:39.110 --> 05:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
estories report uh the Great Bay estor
 
05:57:42.190 --> 05:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
has three times the nitrogen load um
 
05:57:44.468 --> 05:57:44.478 align:start position:0%
that it should have to be protective of
 
05:57:47.030 --> 05:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
estrine Health uh the more recent state
 
05:57:49.190 --> 05:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
of our estories report just released in
 
05:57:49.200 --> 05:57:50.070 align:start position:0%
of our estories report just released in
June

05:57:50.070 --> 05:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
June
 
05:57:52.830 --> 05:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
2023 um indicates that the point sources
 
05:57:54.708 --> 05:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
of nitrogen those coming from wastewater
 
05:57:58.190 --> 05:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities has declined to uh
 
05:57:59.670 --> 05:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
levels that we haven't seen since we
 
05:58:02.190 --> 05:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
started recording nitrogen um in the
 
05:58:05.190 --> 05:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
great Bast this is a cause for great
 
05:58:07.150 --> 05:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
celebration that is because
 
05:58:08.670 --> 05:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities around the Great Bay
 
05:58:10.868 --> 05:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
Region have invested so many millions of
 
05:58:12.750 --> 05:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
dollars in upgrading wastewater
 
05:58:14.868 --> 05:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities so what it means
 
05:58:17.270 --> 05:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
now is that our excess nitrogen load is
 
05:58:19.868 --> 05:58:19.878 align:start position:0%
largely due to storm water and septic
 
05:58:22.390 --> 05:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
systems um around the Great Bay Region
 
05:58:24.830 --> 05:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
we have tens of thousands of them uh
 
05:58:27.750 --> 05:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
about half of the population our 400,000
 
05:58:29.030 --> 05:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
people that live in the Great Bay
 
05:58:32.030 --> 05:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
Watershed uh use septic systems um for
 
05:58:35.948 --> 05:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
their waste waste disposal and um to the
 
05:58:39.110 --> 05:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
best estimates that we have from a 2014
 
05:58:41.230 --> 05:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
report called the Great Bay nitrogen
 
05:58:44.030 --> 05:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
non-point Source study which I think U
 
05:58:46.310 --> 05:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh Mr trobridge had something to do with
 
05:58:48.910 --> 05:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
um we estimate that about onethird of
 
05:58:51.868 --> 05:58:51.878 align:start position:0%
the nitrogen pollution coming uh into
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
the grape astery is coming um from
 
05:58:56.868 --> 05:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
septic systems onethird of the non-point
 
05:58:59.150 --> 05:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
source so the onethird of the the stuff
 
05:59:00.510 --> 05:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
that's not coming from wastewater
 
05:59:02.350 --> 05:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities is coming from
 
05:59:05.510 --> 05:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
septic systems so as I noted there's
 
05:59:07.628 --> 05:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
been a lot of regulatory focus on
 
05:59:09.310 --> 05:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
nitrogen pollution from wastewater
 
05:59:11.750 --> 05:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities those run by our 18
 
05:59:14.270 --> 05:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
mun of the municipalities in the Great
 
05:59:17.910 --> 05:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
Bay but very little attention paid uh to
 
05:59:20.590 --> 05:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
improving uh septic system
 
05:59:24.468 --> 05:59:24.478 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and um so while the
 
05:59:26.788 --> 05:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
volume of the discharge from every
 
05:59:29.548 --> 05:59:29.558 align:start position:0%
individual SE system is rather small the
 
05:59:31.510 --> 05:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus
 
05:59:33.750 --> 05:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
can be as much as 10 times higher than
 
05:59:35.110 --> 05:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
what's coming out of a wastewater
 
05:59:36.390 --> 05:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
treatment facility so we're talking
 
05:59:42.190 --> 05:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
about 30 40 50 um uh uh um uh micro
 
05:59:44.350 --> 05:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
micrograms per liter this is very high
 
05:59:46.750 --> 05:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
when we talk about wastewater treatment
 
05:59:48.830 --> 05:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
facilities that are discharging five six
 
05:59:51.070 --> 05:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
to eight you know micrograms per liter
 
05:59:53.190 --> 05:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
so it's almost an or can be like an
 
05:59:55.430 --> 05:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
order of magnitude more nitrogen and
 
05:59:57.350 --> 05:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
phosphorus pollution coming from septic
 
05:59:58.910 --> 05:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
system systems I think it's important to
 
06:00:01.468 --> 06:00:01.478 align:start position:0%
recognize that it's not just failed
 
06:00:03.468 --> 06:00:03.478 align:start position:0%
septic systems that are the source of
 
06:00:06.070 --> 06:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
this pollution okay septic systems are
 
06:00:08.708 --> 06:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
designed to to really were designed to
 
06:00:12.230 --> 06:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
mitigate bacteria from leaving a
 
06:00:14.990 --> 06:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
waste a Lee field and getting into a
 
06:00:17.548 --> 06:00:17.558 align:start position:0%
water a drinking water well nitrogen and
 
06:00:19.708 --> 06:00:19.718 align:start position:0%
phosphorus are very water soluble they
 
06:00:21.750 --> 06:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
end up going right through the uh
 
06:00:23.788 --> 06:00:23.798 align:start position:0%
through this the tank out into the Lee
 
06:00:25.948 --> 06:00:25.958 align:start position:0%
field and largely getting into the
 
06:00:27.468 --> 06:00:27.478 align:start position:0%
groundwater and moving from there into
 
06:00:30.548 --> 06:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
to Wetland streams and so on and so that
 
06:00:32.310 --> 06:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
is the secret the the little known
 
06:00:34.590 --> 06:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
secret about septic systems is that they
 
06:00:37.030 --> 06:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
really are not effective at reducing
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
this nitrogen and phosphorus that is the
 
06:00:41.548 --> 06:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
cause of cyanobacteria blooms and the
 
06:00:45.110 --> 06:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
freshwater and uh and uh a whole Cascade
 
06:00:48.948 --> 06:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
of ufic in in our saltwater environments
 
06:00:54.670 --> 06:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
some of that will um uh be um mitigated
 
06:00:57.230 --> 06:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
by distance it will be up so there is
 
06:01:00.190 --> 06:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
some uptake in soil and roots and so on
 
06:01:02.270 --> 06:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
but it's why it's especially important
 
06:01:04.750 --> 06:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill that we're expanding the
 
06:01:08.110 --> 06:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
protective Zone from 200 to 250 ft and
 
06:01:10.110 --> 06:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
indeed uh one of the recommendations in
 
06:01:11.628 --> 06:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
the Shoreland septic system study
 
06:01:14.910 --> 06:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
commission was to expand that to 600 ft
 
06:01:17.548 --> 06:01:17.558 align:start position:0%
um that is what uh we believe is
 
06:01:20.230 --> 06:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
actually the appropriate distance um
 
06:01:23.390 --> 06:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
that would uptake that would mitigate a
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
lot of those nutrients from getting into
 
06:01:27.910 --> 06:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
water waste so you're this bill expands
 
06:01:31.110 --> 06:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
50 ft it's again it's a small step but
 
06:01:32.628 --> 06:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's a step in the right
 
06:01:35.548 --> 06:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
direction um another key finding in the
 
06:01:37.190 --> 06:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
Shoreland septic system study commission
 
06:01:39.910 --> 06:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
was how widespread the lack of awareness
 
06:01:42.310 --> 06:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
is by homeowners about the condition the
 
06:01:44.788 --> 06:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
maintenance needs even the location of
 
06:01:47.270 --> 06:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
the septic system this out of sight out
 
06:01:49.430 --> 06:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
of mine problem compounds the challenge
 
06:01:52.350 --> 06:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
of reducing water quality impacts and
 
06:01:55.628 --> 06:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
requiring a septic system in evaluation
 
06:01:57.510 --> 06:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
at the time of a property transfer will
 
06:01:59.788 --> 06:01:59.798 align:start position:0%
make septic systems more visible to the
 
06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
new home buyers and provide
 
06:02:03.868 --> 06:02:03.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Dees with more
 
06:02:06.030 --> 06:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
additional information about septic
 
06:02:08.590 --> 06:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
systems that are underperforming or are
 
06:02:10.670 --> 06:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
intermittently problematic due to
 
06:02:12.948 --> 06:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
changing groundwater levels periods of
 
06:02:15.190 --> 06:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
more intense use and other variables
 
06:02:17.628 --> 06:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
that are exacerbated by climate
 
06:02:20.910 --> 06:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
change um so you know while some have
 
06:02:22.910 --> 06:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
contended that such reviews at the time
 
06:02:24.628 --> 06:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
of property transfer are already
 
06:02:28.310 --> 06:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
universally conducted um at the ma the
 
06:02:29.990 --> 06:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative of the of the banking
 
06:02:31.948 --> 06:02:31.958 align:start position:0%
industry on the Shoreland septic system
 
06:02:35.230 --> 06:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
study commission anecdotally reviewed uh
 
06:02:36.910 --> 06:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
a set of loan agreements and found that
 
06:02:39.708 --> 06:02:39.718 align:start position:0%
many lacked any documentation of septic
 
06:02:43.510 --> 06:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
system assessment or evaluation so while
 
06:02:45.430 --> 06:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully most people who are going into
 
06:02:49.110 --> 06:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
a um a purchase do um do these kinds of
 
06:02:51.390 --> 06:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
Assessments and evaluations uh I think
 
06:02:54.628 --> 06:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
the reality is that many do not so as
 
06:02:57.468 --> 06:02:57.478 align:start position:0%
I've noted I I believe that HB 11113
 
06:03:00.150 --> 06:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
would take a very small step toward more
 
06:03:02.230 --> 06:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
effective regulation of septic systems
 
06:03:04.468 --> 06:03:04.478 align:start position:0%
to better protect the state's precious
 
06:03:07.070 --> 06:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh saltwater and freshwater resources
 
06:03:08.868 --> 06:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
from the threats of nutrient pollution
 
06:03:11.910 --> 06:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
and I urge that uh you approve this and
 
06:03:13.750 --> 06:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
I would support amendments as has been
 
06:03:15.990 --> 06:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
discussed as well thank you and uh I
 
06:03:17.910 --> 06:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
will submit these to your uh through
 
06:03:20.750 --> 06:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
your online portal I'm happy to take any
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any thank you any
 
06:03:24.628 --> 06:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the
 
06:03:27.150 --> 06:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
06:03:27.160 --> 06:03:28.868 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
much

06:03:28.868 --> 06:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
much that is the last uh P card that I
 
06:03:37.468 --> 06:03:37.478 align:start position:0%
have uh with that I will close the uh
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:42.000 --> 06:03:43.910 align:start position:0%

1113
 
06:03:47.910 --> 06:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
close uh one minute to clear the room
 
06:03:55.190 --> 06:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:17.150 --> 06:04:17.160 align:start position:0%

Mass considering whatever whatever she
 
06:04:26.160 --> 06:04:43.310 align:start position:0%
Mass considering whatever whatever she
didn't

06:04:46.350 --> 06:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
spoke about the science behind the
 
06:04:50.230 --> 06:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
nutrients and that's not really we all
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:56.080 --> 06:04:57.590 align:start position:0%

06:08:33.030 --> 06:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
startor repres let me do this again I
 
06:08:35.628 --> 06:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
didn't have my thing
 
06:08:39.510 --> 06:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
on starting house on House Bill
 
06:08:42.310 --> 06:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
1121 care recognizes representative
 
06:08:45.350 --> 06:08:45.360 align:start position:0%

06:08:51.750 --> 06:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
for having me come and introduce this
 
06:08:54.468 --> 06:08:54.478 align:start position:0%
bill to you I am representative Judy
 
06:08:57.150 --> 06:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
Aaron and I represent Sullivan County
 
06:08:59.548 --> 06:08:59.558 align:start position:0%
District 4 representing the towns of

aworth Goan langden lster and
 
06:09:07.150 --> 06:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
Washington I'm introducing this bill HB
 
06:09:10.190 --> 06:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
1121 to you today having to do with
 
06:09:13.110 --> 06:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
Wetland permit exemptions with regard to
 
06:09:15.510 --> 06:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
natural disaster and flooding
 
06:09:19.510 --> 06:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
situations this past summer in July 2023
 
06:09:21.270 --> 06:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
as well as in July
 
06:09:24.788 --> 06:09:24.798 align:start position:0%
2021 many towns experience flooding due
 
06:09:27.788 --> 06:09:27.798 align:start position:0%
to heavy rains for property owners who
 
06:09:30.230 --> 06:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
AB but or who have on their property
 
06:09:32.830 --> 06:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
perennial or seasonal streams there were
 
06:09:35.510 --> 06:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
instances of those streams Rivers Brooks
 
06:09:38.510 --> 06:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
Etc being clogged up with debris and
 
06:09:41.230 --> 06:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
diverting in such a manner as to cause
 
06:09:43.390 --> 06:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
damage or threaten to cause damage to
 
06:09:46.110 --> 06:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
their Gardens their animal pens
 
06:09:48.670 --> 06:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
structures on their property and
 
06:09:51.390 --> 06:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
farmland current law says that if you
 
06:09:53.948 --> 06:09:53.958 align:start position:0%
want to clear out debris from a stream
 
06:09:55.430 --> 06:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
River Brook
 
06:09:58.468 --> 06:09:58.478 align:start position:0%
Etc that you need to get a permit from
 
06:10:01.070 --> 06:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
Dees as described to me by Darlene
 
06:10:03.868 --> 06:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
Forest of Dees Wetlands Bure Bureau
 
06:10:05.990 --> 06:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
administrator and land resources
 
06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
management Property Owners cannot
 
06:10:11.270 --> 06:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
disturb a streamed without a Wetlands
 
06:10:15.788 --> 06:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
permit yes you can also get an emergency
 
06:10:18.390 --> 06:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
permit but these Dees permits are
 
06:10:21.670 --> 06:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
expensive and cost a non-refundable $400
 
06:10:24.990 --> 06:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
fee or more plus the homeowner has to
 
06:10:27.150 --> 06:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
submit a plan for any stream work to be
 
06:10:29.548 --> 06:10:29.558 align:start position:0%
done which can also be quite expensive
 
06:10:32.468 --> 06:10:32.478 align:start position:0%
for the property owner especially if the
 
06:10:36.150 --> 06:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
homeowner has to en engage an engineer
 
06:10:39.750 --> 06:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
and so on the plan can be rejected by
 
06:10:41.708 --> 06:10:41.718 align:start position:0%
Dees and then you've lost the permitting
 
06:10:44.430 --> 06:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
fee and you have to start all over again
 
06:10:46.750 --> 06:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
plus it can take a long time for the
 
06:10:49.430 --> 06:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
permit to be approved by Dees and I
 
06:10:51.230 --> 06:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
think it's outrageous for property
 
06:10:54.110 --> 06:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
owners to go through this whether as an
 
06:10:56.708 --> 06:10:56.718 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization or not the
 
06:10:58.948 --> 06:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
simply want to clear out the debris that
 
06:11:02.230 --> 06:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
is collected in their in the Stream um
 
06:11:05.788 --> 06:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible um with as little as
 
06:11:09.350 --> 06:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
little um disturbance as possible after
 
06:11:13.510 --> 06:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
any kind of um uh flooding event or a
 
06:11:15.628 --> 06:11:15.638 align:start position:0%
storm normally we go into our yards and
 
06:11:19.390 --> 06:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
we clear out all kinds of sticks and
 
06:11:21.430 --> 06:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
stuff that has been flying around we
 
06:11:23.190 --> 06:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
should be able to do that with our
 
06:11:26.990 --> 06:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
streams as well especially if it diverts
 
06:11:29.670 --> 06:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the stream from uh from its
 
06:11:32.708 --> 06:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
natural course and now uh the stream is
 
06:11:34.510 --> 06:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
going in a different
 
06:11:37.270 --> 06:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
direction Miss Forest informed me that a
 
06:11:39.708 --> 06:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
property owner May remove certain Woody
 
06:11:42.150 --> 06:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
debris from a riverbed but a Wetlands
 
06:11:43.548 --> 06:11:43.558 align:start position:0%

06:11:45.628 --> 06:11:45.638 align:start position:0%
construction excavation and fill in a
 
06:11:48.548 --> 06:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
wetlands jurisdictional area that being
 
06:11:51.390 --> 06:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
said any Woody debris in question cannot
 
06:11:53.548 --> 06:11:53.558 align:start position:0%
be embedded in the bed or Bank of the
 
06:11:56.510 --> 06:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
river removing easily retrievable Woody
 
06:11:59.390 --> 06:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
debris is not considered excavation and
 
06:12:01.270 --> 06:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
therefore would not require Wetlands
 
06:12:03.590 --> 06:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
permitting but you can't enter into the
 
06:12:06.628 --> 06:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
river to remove the debris you need to
 
06:12:10.110 --> 06:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
modify the bed or bank by the river if
 
06:12:12.548 --> 06:12:12.558 align:start position:0%
you need to modify the bed or Bank of
 
06:12:15.110 --> 06:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
the river for equipment access then that
 
06:12:16.788 --> 06:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
access preparation might require a
 
06:12:19.590 --> 06:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
permit as well so unless you can extract
 
06:12:21.390 --> 06:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
the Woody debris from the perennial or
 
06:12:23.310 --> 06:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
seasonal stream without going into the
 
06:12:25.468 --> 06:12:25.478 align:start position:0%
river or somehow pick it out with a
 
06:12:27.788 --> 06:12:27.798 align:start position:0%
crane then you don't need a
 
06:12:30.510 --> 06:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
permit Dees provided me with a fact
 
06:12:32.750 --> 06:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
sheet managing large Woody material in
 
06:12:34.548 --> 06:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
rivers and streams which I've passed out
 
06:12:35.708 --> 06:12:35.718 align:start position:0%
to all of
 
06:12:38.548 --> 06:12:38.558 align:start position:0%
you it summarizes the provisions in our
 
06:12:40.510 --> 06:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
statute RSA
 
06:12:46.070 --> 06:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
482a and and the rules um from NHC EnV
 
06:12:49.868 --> 06:12:49.878 align:start position:0%
WT 100 to 900 governing the removal of
 
06:12:52.110 --> 06:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
debris which they call large wood large
 
06:12:55.430 --> 06:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
Woody material um the fact sheet States
 
06:12:56.830 --> 06:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
essentially that you can clear the
 
06:12:58.830 --> 06:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
material if you own the land under the
 
06:13:01.230 --> 06:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
stream or get the permission of the land
 
06:13:02.948 --> 06:13:02.958 align:start position:0%
owner as long as you don't do anything
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
to disturb the riverbed or the banks if
 
06:13:07.990 --> 06:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
the removal would disturb the riverbed
 
06:13:10.030 --> 06:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
or Banks a permit is
 
06:13:13.910 --> 06:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
required so what happens you so you can
 
06:13:15.990 --> 06:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
pick out this Woody debris and get rid
 
06:13:18.310 --> 06:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
of it and that's fine but what happens
 
06:13:20.390 --> 06:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the material that's
 
06:13:22.110 --> 06:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
clogging up your stream or your Brook
 
06:13:24.230 --> 06:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
that needs to be removed in order for
 
06:13:27.590 --> 06:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
the river to flow where it was flowing
 
06:13:29.990 --> 06:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
before consider that the new course of
 
06:13:32.350 --> 06:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
the perennial or seasonal stream is now
 
06:13:34.590 --> 06:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
running over the banks and beginning new
 
06:13:37.390 --> 06:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
erosion of what was previously not land
 
06:13:40.830 --> 06:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
under the stream brook or river consider
 
06:13:42.868 --> 06:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
that this new course of the river is
 
06:13:45.030 --> 06:13:45.040 align:start position:0%

the dees rules a property owner now
 
06:13:53.628 --> 06:13:53.638 align:start position:0%

the property owner does the work then a

permitting and stream management
 
06:15:40.350 --> 06:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
practices if the affected area of the
 
06:15:41.868 --> 06:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
perennial or seasonal stream has a
 
06:15:44.270 --> 06:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
Butters the property owner must contact
 
06:15:45.910 --> 06:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
a Butters to the perennial or seasonal
 
06:15:48.350 --> 06:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
stream in question and notify them of
 
06:15:49.708 --> 06:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
the problem and the work that he's
 
06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
planning to be done to clear the debris
 
06:15:55.510 --> 06:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
and restore the course of this stream if
 
06:15:57.150 --> 06:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
the affected area of the perennial
 
06:16:00.110 --> 06:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
stream flows under a municipal bridge
 
06:16:01.868 --> 06:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
then it is the responsibility of the
 
06:16:04.230 --> 06:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
municipality to obtain any necessary
 
06:16:06.030 --> 06:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
emergency Wetland permits and clear the
 
06:16:08.430 --> 06:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
debris blockage or buildup if the
 
06:16:09.910 --> 06:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
affected area of the perennial or
 
06:16:12.110 --> 06:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
seasonal stream flows under the state
 
06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
brid a state bridge then is the
 
06:16:16.230 --> 06:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state of
 
06:16:18.628 --> 06:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation to obtain
 
06:16:21.190 --> 06:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
any necessary emergency Wetland permits
 
06:16:24.230 --> 06:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
and clear the debris blockage or buildup
 
06:16:26.868 --> 06:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
so I believe that
 
06:16:28.910 --> 06:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
we need to implement some common sense
 
06:16:31.070 --> 06:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
here a property owner shouldn't have to
 
06:16:33.150 --> 06:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
jump through hoops pay a lot of money
 
06:16:36.868 --> 06:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
for unref undable permits or wait months
 
06:16:39.150 --> 06:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
for Dees permit approval in order to
 
06:16:42.150 --> 06:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
Simply remove debris and blockages from
 
06:16:44.150 --> 06:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
the streams on their
 
06:16:46.628 --> 06:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
property the fear that a property owner
 
06:16:48.830 --> 06:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
may not know what they're doing or may
 
06:16:51.190 --> 06:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
make the problem worse or may just set
 
06:16:52.590 --> 06:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
themselves up for the same thing to
 
06:16:56.190 --> 06:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
occur again it's a tired argument but
 
06:16:58.390 --> 06:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
with that in mind I've set Provisions in
 
06:17:01.150 --> 06:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
the bill for people to be consulted for
 
06:17:02.788 --> 06:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
the work that the property owner wants
 
06:17:04.750 --> 06:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
to do to clear these blockages out of
 
06:17:08.548 --> 06:17:08.558 align:start position:0%
the streams after a flooding event again
 
06:17:11.750 --> 06:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
to me this is just common sense most of
 
06:17:13.510 --> 06:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
the problems I've seen with flooding in
 
06:17:13.520 --> 06:17:14.788 align:start position:0%
the problems I've seen with flooding in
my

06:17:14.788 --> 06:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:17:17.230 --> 06:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
area is because there's been a sore
 
06:17:20.230 --> 06:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
lacking of river and stream management
 
06:17:21.788 --> 06:17:21.798 align:start position:0%
and I think it's the result of the
 
06:17:24.548 --> 06:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
statutes we have in place and the dees
 
06:17:26.628 --> 06:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
philosophy regarding this
 
06:17:29.150 --> 06:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
their philosophy seems to be to leave
 
06:17:31.310 --> 06:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
nature do its thing and that Rivers
 
06:17:32.910 --> 06:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
streams and Brooks have their own
 
06:17:35.110 --> 06:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
Natural Evolution and that we shouldn't
 
06:17:37.468 --> 06:17:37.478 align:start position:0%
mess with it and that organisms develop
 
06:17:39.150 --> 06:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
in those blockages and we shouldn't
 
06:17:42.150 --> 06:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
disturb them well what about the
 
06:17:44.430 --> 06:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
property owner and the aggravation they
 
06:17:47.110 --> 06:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
have from a flooding event what about
 
06:17:48.548 --> 06:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
the loss of
 
06:17:52.190 --> 06:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
land the loss of physical property
 
06:17:54.390 --> 06:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
because a perennial or seasonal stream
 
06:17:57.150 --> 06:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
is changing course because of blockages
 
06:18:00.390 --> 06:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
that happen after a flooding event the
 
06:18:02.750 --> 06:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
truth is that leaving debris to
 
06:18:05.150 --> 06:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
accumulate and allowing a river brook or
 
06:18:08.230 --> 06:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
stream to go wherever it wants is not a
 
06:18:10.990 --> 06:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
welcome idea for many Property Owners
 
06:18:13.390 --> 06:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
the sooner a blockage is cleared out the
 
06:18:15.708 --> 06:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
better then we don't allow for further
 
06:18:17.510 --> 06:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
erosion of land where the streamer River
 
06:18:20.070 --> 06:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
didn't go before and we aren't allowing
 
06:18:22.310 --> 06:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
organisms and Wildlife or fish to set up
 
06:18:25.150 --> 06:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
house there either why should a property
 
06:18:27.110 --> 06:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
owner be saddled with dealing with
 
06:18:29.590 --> 06:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
engineering plans and cumbersome
 
06:18:31.788 --> 06:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
permitting the property owner just wants
 
06:18:33.670 --> 06:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
to get the perennial stream or a
 
06:18:36.150 --> 06:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
seasonal stream cleared out and back to
 
06:18:38.590 --> 06:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
where it was as soon as
 
06:18:41.628 --> 06:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
possible and as for a Dees emergency
 
06:18:44.150 --> 06:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
provision allowing for permit exemptions
 
06:18:45.390 --> 06:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
such that you can clear out these
 
06:18:48.750 --> 06:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
streams during a flooding event how many
 
06:18:50.548 --> 06:18:50.558 align:start position:0%
Property Owners will want to risk their
 
06:18:53.510 --> 06:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
life and limb during a heavy rainfall to
 
06:18:56.110 --> 06:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
clear out a raging River or Brook I
 
06:18:57.510 --> 06:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't suspect
 
06:19:01.150 --> 06:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
any in general our state Dees needs to
 
06:19:03.910 --> 06:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
do better assess to needs to better
 
06:19:06.390 --> 06:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
assess the amount of debris damage that
 
06:19:08.390 --> 06:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
occurs in the affected streams after a
 
06:19:11.910 --> 06:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
natural disaster or heavy rains we're
 
06:19:13.910 --> 06:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
seeing streams with massive rocks and
 
06:19:16.270 --> 06:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
debris from rain from the rains change
 
06:19:18.468 --> 06:19:18.478 align:start position:0%
course because they're blocked up and
 
06:19:20.190 --> 06:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
those streams never get cleared out or
 
06:19:22.548 --> 06:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
dredged properly putting property
 
06:19:25.390 --> 06:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
including historic buildings and Roads
 
06:19:27.590 --> 06:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
at High higher risk for future natural
 
06:19:30.030 --> 06:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
events this has happened specifically at
 
06:19:33.070 --> 06:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
Bowers Brook in aworth town center where
 
06:19:35.590 --> 06:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
now the brook is so blocked up that it's
 
06:19:37.230 --> 06:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
threatening historical buildings
 
06:19:39.390 --> 06:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
including our Village store which has
 
06:19:41.430 --> 06:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
been flooded twice in the past four
 
06:19:44.830 --> 06:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
years to their credit Dees and the state
 
06:19:47.910 --> 06:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
do are assisting the town of aworth now
 
06:19:50.788 --> 06:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
in fixing the problem but we live daily
 
06:19:53.510 --> 06:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
with fears of more flooding until Dees
 
06:19:55.750 --> 06:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
engineering Solutions and blockage
 
06:19:57.788 --> 06:19:57.798 align:start position:0%
clearance is is
 
06:20:00.788 --> 06:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
accomplished and um I'm I know we're
 
06:20:03.948 --> 06:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
waiting we we we're uh forecasted for
 
06:20:06.868 --> 06:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
two days of heavy rains next week so
 
06:20:08.868 --> 06:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
we're worried that uh the stream is
 
06:20:10.830 --> 06:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
going to jump its banks
 
06:20:13.468 --> 06:20:13.478 align:start position:0%
again I've also seen buildup of debris
 
06:20:16.548 --> 06:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
and naturally changing uh the naturally
 
06:20:18.830 --> 06:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
changing nature of the Cold River
 
06:20:21.990 --> 06:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
affecting VIIs pool in alad and that's
 
06:20:23.948 --> 06:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
been going on for more than a decade
 
06:20:26.788 --> 06:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
such that in the past two floods of July
 
06:20:30.788 --> 06:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
2021 and July 2023 the Cold River jumped
 
06:20:33.510 --> 06:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
its banks and took out portions of Route
 
06:20:36.390 --> 06:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
123a the town of alad should be dredging
 
06:20:39.788 --> 06:20:39.798 align:start position:0%
that area in a VIIs pool but the permit
 
06:20:41.510 --> 06:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
and Engineering costs have been too much
 
06:20:43.948 --> 06:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
for the town to bear so the problem just
 
06:20:47.230 --> 06:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
keeps getting worse and as I said we
 
06:20:49.270 --> 06:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
need to do a better job of understanding
 
06:20:51.350 --> 06:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
and more importantly implementing stream
 
06:20:54.350 --> 06:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
management after rains rain events
 
06:20:56.830 --> 06:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
happen the same goes for management of
 
06:20:59.310 --> 06:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
beaver bogs as they tend to break after
 
06:21:01.548 --> 06:21:01.558 align:start position:0%
heavy rains and have caused Great damage
 
06:21:04.628 --> 06:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
ditto for our dams both Municipal and
 
06:21:06.910 --> 06:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
private so I hope that you'll consider
 
06:21:08.670 --> 06:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
what I've presented today listen to some
 
06:21:10.670 --> 06:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
of the testimony people who have dis
 
06:21:12.830 --> 06:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
been disaffected by the current
 
06:21:14.910 --> 06:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
permitting rules and pass this bill out
 
06:21:17.230 --> 06:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
of your committee it's time that we give
 
06:21:19.430 --> 06:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
Property Owners a break especially in a
 
06:21:21.628 --> 06:21:21.638 align:start position:0%
time when they have a huge issue an
 
06:21:23.708 --> 06:21:23.718 align:start position:0%
expense in front of them to clean up
 
06:21:25.990 --> 06:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
Damage Done by their on their land by
 
06:21:28.868 --> 06:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
natural disasters and flooding so I'd be
 
06:21:30.670 --> 06:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that you
 
06:21:30.680 --> 06:21:32.670 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that you
have

06:21:32.670 --> 06:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:21:36.070 --> 06:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
um and um I'm thankful that you listened
 
06:21:38.350 --> 06:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
today I did know that there were a
 
06:21:40.070 --> 06:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
couple of people who planned on uh
 
06:21:42.270 --> 06:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
submitting testimony through the portal
 
06:21:44.468 --> 06:21:44.478 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you will uh check out
 
06:21:46.788 --> 06:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
what was written online as
 
06:21:49.230 --> 06:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
well any questions by members of the
 
06:21:51.548 --> 06:21:51.558 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
06:21:53.990 --> 06:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
06:21:56.788 --> 06:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron for my question
 
06:21:59.990 --> 06:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
um there's a few terms in the bill that
 
06:22:01.670 --> 06:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about but I'd like to just
 
06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
focus on one um last last year we heard
 
06:22:09.310 --> 06:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
uh a bill about natural disasters and
 
06:22:11.430 --> 06:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
one of the big concerns about that bill
 
06:22:14.230 --> 06:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
was the lack of definition of natural
 
06:22:18.230 --> 06:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
disaster this um that bill required um
 
06:22:21.110 --> 06:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
Dees to Define rules related to natural
 
06:22:24.030 --> 06:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
disasters but as I read this this allows
 
06:22:27.190 --> 06:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
the property owner to take action based
 
06:22:30.190 --> 06:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
on what might be their uh understanding
 
06:22:32.310 --> 06:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
of a natural disaster so as a natural
 
06:22:34.030 --> 06:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
dis can you describe what a natural
 
06:22:36.270 --> 06:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
disaster is to you and how a property
 
06:22:39.670 --> 06:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
owner would um distinguish an event
 
06:22:41.868 --> 06:22:41.878 align:start position:0%
where they can remedy the situation on
 
06:22:44.070 --> 06:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
their own versus uh you know a half an
 
06:22:46.628 --> 06:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
inch of rain thank
 
06:22:49.510 --> 06:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
you well it would appear to me I think
 
06:22:52.830 --> 06:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
just in common sense for for first for
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
starters um I'm I'm happy to amend this
 
06:23:01.270 --> 06:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
bill to change any wording that um more
 
06:23:03.270 --> 06:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
clearly defines a
 
06:23:06.430 --> 06:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
situation um but that being said I think
 
06:23:09.468 --> 06:23:09.478 align:start position:0%
that Common Sense can dictate that the
 
06:23:11.190 --> 06:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
difference between you know a couple of
 
06:23:13.830 --> 06:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
inches of rain and an actual flooding
 
06:23:16.948 --> 06:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
that happens where water jumps over the
 
06:23:20.628 --> 06:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
banks um or is going in in places where
 
06:23:25.990 --> 06:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
it really was not before um where where
 
06:23:29.430 --> 06:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
water is coming now uh threatening um
 
06:23:31.750 --> 06:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
animal pens and and barns and things
 
06:23:37.270 --> 06:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
like that um we're seeing heavier rains
 
06:23:41.590 --> 06:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
coming um more flooding happening and um
 
06:23:42.430 --> 06:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
I think
 
06:23:47.350 --> 06:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
that people are aware that damage can be
 
06:23:51.390 --> 06:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
done as a result of um you know more
 
06:23:53.910 --> 06:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
precipitation so I think just common
 
06:23:56.628 --> 06:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
sense dictates that um
 
06:23:58.868 --> 06:23:58.878 align:start position:0%
you know this is not an a thing where
 
06:24:03.510 --> 06:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:06.510 --> 06:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
happens representative
 
06:24:08.750 --> 06:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
R thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:24:10.990 --> 06:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
06:24:14.628 --> 06:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
noticed in the bill it mentions about um
 
06:24:17.030 --> 06:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
notifying AB Butters to the perennial or
 
06:24:20.390 --> 06:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
seasonal stream would is your intent
 
06:24:22.628 --> 06:24:22.638 align:start position:0%
that those abutters would also abut the
 
06:24:24.510 --> 06:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
property of the person who is going to
 
06:24:27.030 --> 06:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
be doing the clearance ing because there
 
06:24:28.628 --> 06:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
might be a stream that could be a mile
 
06:24:30.990 --> 06:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
or so long so would would all the
 
06:24:35.110 --> 06:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
abutters have to be notified all
 
06:24:38.430 --> 06:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
Downstream I think just the the um the
 
06:24:40.190 --> 06:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
immediate the abutters that are
 
06:24:42.830 --> 06:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
immediate to the area that is being
 
06:24:45.948 --> 06:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
affected so that um you know if you have
 
06:24:48.468 --> 06:24:48.478 align:start position:0%
a stream that's running on your property
 
06:24:50.190 --> 06:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:24:54.310 --> 06:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's you have a butter right next door
 
06:24:56.150 --> 06:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
um basically get in touch with your
 
06:24:58.788 --> 06:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
neighbor who is who is uh abing that
 
06:25:00.310 --> 06:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
stream and let them
 
06:25:03.670 --> 06:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
know okay followup or followup
 
06:25:07.110 --> 06:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I think you know if we looked
 
06:25:09.230 --> 06:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
at this bill that might be something
 
06:25:11.948 --> 06:25:11.958 align:start position:0%
that we'd want to specify some more
 
06:25:15.150 --> 06:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
because if I lived a half a mile down
 
06:25:17.150 --> 06:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
stream I would consider myself in a
 
06:25:19.990 --> 06:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
butter and if I was affected you know I
 
06:25:22.310 --> 06:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
just think maybe we could kind of firm
 
06:25:25.390 --> 06:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
that up a little bit but um and i' be
 
06:25:27.868 --> 06:25:27.878 align:start position:0%
happy to do that yeah okay thank you um
 
06:25:30.948 --> 06:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
but also we have a letter here from Dees
 
06:25:33.590 --> 06:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
and it kind of touches upon the area of
 
06:25:37.468 --> 06:25:37.478 align:start position:0%
the bill that talks about um notifying
 
06:25:40.510 --> 06:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
or she'll document where is it um it's
 
06:25:44.350 --> 06:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
about bring in the conservation officer
 
06:25:47.190 --> 06:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
and what what role do you see with the
 
06:25:50.670 --> 06:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
conservation officer as uh someone who
 
06:25:54.350 --> 06:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
who is familiar with the wetlands um
 
06:25:57.548 --> 06:25:57.558 align:start position:0%
management and who can offer some
 
06:26:01.788 --> 06:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
advice um to the to the property owner
 
06:26:04.468 --> 06:26:04.478 align:start position:0%
okay um because one of the concerns is
 
06:26:06.590 --> 06:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the conservation officer doesn't
 
06:26:08.350 --> 06:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
have that background that maybe they're
 
06:26:10.468 --> 06:26:10.478 align:start position:0%
just for law enforcement of the
 
06:26:13.310 --> 06:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
conservation laws so that might be
 
06:26:15.310 --> 06:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
something too that could be getting
 
06:26:19.590 --> 06:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
someone with more expertise I guess
 
06:26:22.350 --> 06:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
um well I would assume that if they are
 
06:26:24.030 --> 06:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with the
 
06:26:29.070 --> 06:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
rules uh and the and the and the rsas
 
06:26:31.590 --> 06:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
having to do with stream
 
06:26:34.310 --> 06:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
management that those are the laws that
 
06:26:36.390 --> 06:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
they are enforcing I would assume that
 
06:26:39.788 --> 06:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
they would have some knowledge of um
 
06:26:42.590 --> 06:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
being able to give some advice as to
 
06:26:44.948 --> 06:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
what would be prudent to do and not
 
06:26:48.430 --> 06:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
prudent to do okay thank you and you
 
06:26:50.430 --> 06:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
know I mean
 
06:26:53.070 --> 06:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
listening oh just one just just
 
06:26:54.590 --> 06:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
listening to your testimony I am
 
06:26:57.110 --> 06:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
empathetic I mean that that is a tough
 
06:26:59.948 --> 06:26:59.958 align:start position:0%
situation for those owners thank you Mr
 
06:27:03.628 --> 06:27:03.638 align:start position:0%
chair uh you mentioned a letter from D
 
06:27:05.788 --> 06:27:05.798 align:start position:0%

anywhere Beyond
[Music]

06:27:49.788 --> 06:27:49.798 align:start position:0%

there you got one what if where is there
 
06:27:54.030 --> 06:27:54.040 align:start position:0%

any up
there

06:28:03.270 --> 06:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:08.430 --> 06:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
is it maybe is that it there okay
 
06:28:11.110 --> 06:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh we'll blame representative Simpson
 
06:28:16.110 --> 06:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:20.670 --> 06:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
here okay there you go I guess it goes
 
06:28:24.190 --> 06:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
down thank you representative Derby for
 
06:28:26.708 --> 06:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
a question thank you again Mr chair
 
06:28:28.590 --> 06:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
thanks again for taking my
 
06:28:31.468 --> 06:28:31.478 align:start position:0%
question just I have a a question about
 
06:28:32.430 --> 06:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
just some of
 
06:28:34.788 --> 06:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
the wording that it says the property
 
06:28:36.670 --> 06:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
owner shall document the work done and
 
06:28:38.948 --> 06:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
may include photo documentation what
 
06:28:40.150 --> 06:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
what's your thought behind that like
 
06:28:41.390 --> 06:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
what are they going to do how are they
 
06:28:43.030 --> 06:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
going to what's going to H happen with
 
06:28:44.590 --> 06:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
that documentation so that they can show
 
06:28:47.830 --> 06:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
what the um what the condition was after
 
06:28:47.840 --> 06:28:48.628 align:start position:0%
what the um what the condition was after
the

06:28:48.628 --> 06:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:28:52.468 --> 06:28:52.478 align:start position:0%
flooding and then show what their remedy
 
06:28:55.510 --> 06:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
was to to put the stream back to where
 
06:28:58.230 --> 06:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
it was before just to have uh something
 
06:29:01.468 --> 06:29:01.478 align:start position:0%
to show that um they had done something
 
06:29:03.948 --> 06:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
to put the stream back to where it was
 
06:29:06.948 --> 06:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
for a followup thank you um would they
 
06:29:08.468 --> 06:29:08.478 align:start position:0%
submit this someplace or would they keep
 
06:29:10.270 --> 06:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
it I'm just I'm curious I guess they
 
06:29:12.390 --> 06:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
could keep it for themselves I could
 
06:29:16.230 --> 06:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
submit it to the town um unless Dees
 
06:29:19.190 --> 06:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
comes by and wants to see something okay
 
06:29:21.510 --> 06:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
at least they have something that shows
 
06:29:23.030 --> 06:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
what the condition was after the
 
06:29:26.230 --> 06:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
flooding event and um and what they did
 
06:29:29.070 --> 06:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
to uh put that stream back or clear that
 
06:29:34.310 --> 06:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
blockage out I mean you know the thing
 
06:29:37.750 --> 06:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
is we have we have these these uh
 
06:29:39.868 --> 06:29:39.878 align:start position:0%
flooding events and I I know that there
 
06:29:41.830 --> 06:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
are people in my town who this has
 
06:29:43.430 --> 06:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
happened to they have a stream we have a
 
06:29:46.628 --> 06:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
lot of water in hackworth um we we have
 
06:29:49.510 --> 06:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
streams that that get blocked up with
 
06:29:49.520 --> 06:29:50.788 align:start position:0%
streams that that get blocked up with
stuff

06:29:50.788 --> 06:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
06:29:53.468 --> 06:29:53.478 align:start position:0%
and I I know that there are people who
 
06:29:55.628 --> 06:29:55.638 align:start position:0%
are going out there and clearing these
 
06:29:58.350 --> 06:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
streams anyway without a permit if they
 
06:29:59.868 --> 06:29:59.878 align:start position:0%
can't be seen by the road they're going
 
06:30:01.750 --> 06:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
to clear it out because they want to
 
06:30:04.948 --> 06:30:04.958 align:start position:0%
protect their livestock pens or whatever
 
06:30:08.230 --> 06:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
is being threatened by the change of the
 
06:30:11.788 --> 06:30:11.798 align:start position:0%
riverbed and um and it's the folks who
 
06:30:13.948 --> 06:30:13.958 align:start position:0%
you can see their their stuff by the
 
06:30:16.070 --> 06:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
road that are the ones that are being
 
06:30:17.948 --> 06:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
monitored and there's somewhat of a of
 
06:30:20.230 --> 06:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
an unfairness here
 
06:30:25.468 --> 06:30:25.478 align:start position:0%
too um that's going on and um
 
06:30:28.310 --> 06:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me I I just think that it's just
 
06:30:30.270 --> 06:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
common sense if you have a stream that
 
06:30:32.788 --> 06:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
wasn't blocked before now it's blocked
 
06:30:35.548 --> 06:30:35.558 align:start position:0%
up and it's causing damage somewhere
 
06:30:37.788 --> 06:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
just go out and clear it out I mean this
 
06:30:40.030 --> 06:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem like it's rocket science
 
06:30:43.510 --> 06:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's just get it cleared out and let the
 
06:30:45.510 --> 06:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
stream go back to the the natural course
 
06:30:48.030 --> 06:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
of where it was before without waiting
 
06:30:51.708 --> 06:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
months for a a a plan to be approved
 
06:30:54.910 --> 06:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
without cost of $400 for a permit
 
06:30:56.788 --> 06:30:56.798 align:start position:0%
without having to go to town hall and
 
06:30:59.510 --> 06:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
submit things and duplicate triplicate I
 
06:31:01.070 --> 06:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
mean why do we have to deal with this
 
06:31:04.910 --> 06:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
whole big bureaucratic mess then just go
 
06:31:06.948 --> 06:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
out and take care of the problem and get
 
06:31:06.958 --> 06:31:09.150 align:start position:0%
out and take care of the problem and get
it

06:31:09.150 --> 06:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:31:12.070 --> 06:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
fixed any other questions by members of
 
06:31:12.080 --> 06:31:13.548 align:start position:0%
fixed any other questions by members of
the

06:31:13.548 --> 06:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:31:15.510 --> 06:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
06:31:18.830 --> 06:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
none much thank
 
06:31:23.070 --> 06:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:32.830 --> 06:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:32.840 --> 06:31:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
good

06:31:33.590 --> 06:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
good
 
06:31:35.750 --> 06:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman members of the
 
06:31:39.388 --> 06:31:39.398 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Brian Sullivan um I
 
06:31:41.708 --> 06:31:41.718 align:start position:0%
represent Sullivan County district one
 
06:31:45.590 --> 06:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
which is um my fine town of Grandam
 
06:31:48.388 --> 06:31:48.398 align:start position:0%
um I am not here because I am ex an
 
06:31:51.548 --> 06:31:51.558 align:start position:0%
expert on Wetlands um if you ask me some
 
06:31:55.548 --> 06:31:55.558 align:start position:0%
technical questions I can prove that um
 
06:31:57.350 --> 06:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
however I am here because I believe this
 
06:31:59.708 --> 06:31:59.718 align:start position:0%
is a problem that really needs a
 
06:32:04.430 --> 06:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
solution um and if this bill as drafted
 
06:32:07.190 --> 06:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
is not exactly what will solve the
 
06:32:10.070 --> 06:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
problem then I urge you to um this
 
06:32:12.750 --> 06:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee to access the resources that
 
06:32:16.350 --> 06:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
are at your disposal to to find a way to
 
06:32:20.670 --> 06:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
um mitigate um these ever more common um
 
06:32:22.750 --> 06:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
serious floods and it's not just
 
06:32:24.590 --> 06:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County we we got really nailed
 
06:32:29.628 --> 06:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
naed last summer um but um gorm got
 
06:32:33.468 --> 06:32:33.478 align:start position:0%
nailed a couple weeks ago um so it's U
 
06:32:36.750 --> 06:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
it it's a problem across the state and
 
06:32:39.948 --> 06:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
um people need to be able to um to
 
06:32:44.910 --> 06:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
protect uh vulnerable property and um
 
06:32:46.430 --> 06:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just here to urge you to find a
 
06:32:48.670 --> 06:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
solution you know I saw one of the
 
06:32:52.830 --> 06:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
letters of uh uh lobbying the um
 
06:32:56.388 --> 06:32:56.398 align:start position:0%
committee said let's let's start a study
 
06:32:59.070 --> 06:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
um I urge you to find a solution as soon
 
06:33:01.590 --> 06:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
as possible because uh next
 
06:33:03.868 --> 06:33:03.878 align:start position:0%
summer I would bet anything we will have
 
06:33:05.990 --> 06:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
another series of floods um they are
 
06:33:08.990 --> 06:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
just coming more and more frequently so
 
06:33:12.110 --> 06:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
um um I can't give you the solution
 
06:33:13.708 --> 06:33:13.718 align:start position:0%
because again it's not my area of
 
06:33:16.670 --> 06:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
expertise but there are folks um within
 
06:33:20.788 --> 06:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
Dees and um um other folks who you have
 
06:33:23.270 --> 06:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
access to that can find a way to
 
06:33:26.070 --> 06:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
streamline this process because if as
 
06:33:28.910 --> 06:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
people wait weeks and weeks to mitigate
 
06:33:32.270 --> 06:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
a problem um the rain comes in again and
 
06:33:35.788 --> 06:33:35.798 align:start position:0%
the problem gets that much worse so um
 
06:33:39.468 --> 06:33:39.478 align:start position:0%
um I there is one um area within the
 
06:33:41.190 --> 06:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill that I would suggest um a
 
06:33:43.830 --> 06:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
modification would be um
 
06:33:46.628 --> 06:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate in line
 
06:33:51.310 --> 06:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
seven it refers to um property Gardens
 
06:33:55.628 --> 06:33:55.638 align:start position:0%
field crops livestock pens fences or
 
06:33:58.310 --> 06:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
structures um when you lead that off
 
06:34:01.070 --> 06:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
with the word property um that basically
 
06:34:03.788 --> 06:34:03.798 align:start position:0%
covers all property and I don't think it
 
06:34:07.708 --> 06:34:07.718 align:start position:0%
was the intention of this um um Bill to
 
06:34:10.948 --> 06:34:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh cover the corner of a wood lot um so
 
06:34:14.670 --> 06:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
I I I believe the idea is to uh protect
 
06:34:17.708 --> 06:34:17.718 align:start position:0%
sensitive property not any and all
 
06:34:20.750 --> 06:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
property that might exist um so that's I
 
06:34:23.468 --> 06:34:23.478 align:start position:0%
think deleting the word property um and
 
06:34:25.388 --> 06:34:25.398 align:start position:0%
if there's other type of sensitive
 
06:34:27.510 --> 06:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
property that the committee feels
 
06:34:29.990 --> 06:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to add to that um I think
 
06:34:31.750 --> 06:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine but just using the word
 
06:34:35.270 --> 06:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
property means you know any piece of
 
06:34:38.590 --> 06:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
land would would be included um so with
 
06:34:42.388 --> 06:34:42.398 align:start position:0%
that um I'll end my testimony and I hope
 
06:34:45.150 --> 06:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
I don't have to take any
 
06:34:49.430 --> 06:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:49.440 --> 06:34:53.388 align:start position:0%
 
any

06:34:53.388 --> 06:34:53.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:53.398 --> 06:34:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
who

06:34:55.430 --> 06:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:34:56.830 --> 06:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
will you take a question from
 
06:34:59.468 --> 06:34:59.478 align:start position:0%
representative Darby absolutely SP it's
 
06:35:02.468 --> 06:35:02.478 align:start position:0%
spell your name for who he
 
06:35:04.868 --> 06:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
remembers thank you Mr chair um thank
 
06:35:07.070 --> 06:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
you genuinely for taking my question um
 
06:35:09.388 --> 06:35:09.398 align:start position:0%
and of course as representative rung
 
06:35:11.990 --> 06:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
said a minute ago um it's it's clear
 
06:35:14.110 --> 06:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
that they're you know it's it's very
 
06:35:17.070 --> 06:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
easy to be empathetic to the problems um
 
06:35:18.990 --> 06:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
and your statement about a problem in
 
06:35:22.190 --> 06:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
need of solution I wonder um there's
 
06:35:25.030 --> 06:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
some existing statutes for um allowing
 
06:35:26.750 --> 06:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to adopt rules to
 
06:35:30.990 --> 06:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
either wave um uh uh permits in certain
 
06:35:33.350 --> 06:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
conditions or expedite them and I wonder
 
06:35:36.750 --> 06:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
if that would when you ask the committee
 
06:35:38.788 --> 06:35:38.798 align:start position:0%
to to search for a solution if you would
 
06:35:42.030 --> 06:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
be um willing to consider rules adopted
 
06:35:45.070 --> 06:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
under those statutes for these
 
06:35:47.590 --> 06:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
situations my understanding is and again
 
06:35:50.628 --> 06:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with the Department um
 
06:35:52.708 --> 06:35:52.718 align:start position:0%
that much my understanding is the
 
06:35:55.150 --> 06:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
department has been reluctant to to uh
 
06:35:57.708 --> 06:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
expedite this to the extent that uh I
 
06:36:01.030 --> 06:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
believe might be needed so um I'm not
 
06:36:02.830 --> 06:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
sure that Ru making would uh would get
 
06:36:06.310 --> 06:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:13.388 --> 06:36:13.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:17.350 --> 06:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
much Darlene forced
 
06:36:20.230 --> 06:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
for Environmental
 
06:36:23.468 --> 06:36:23.478 align:start position:0%
Services the the got to Chang his name
 
06:36:30.468 --> 06:36:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:32.468 --> 06:36:32.478 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again my name is Darlene
 
06:36:34.628 --> 06:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
Forest I'm the current Wetlands buau
 
06:36:36.350 --> 06:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
administrator previously Shoreline
 
06:36:38.468 --> 06:36:38.478 align:start position:0%
section supervisor for the de New
 
06:36:40.868 --> 06:36:40.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
06:36:44.230 --> 06:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
Services thank you for um allowing me
 
06:36:45.948 --> 06:36:45.958 align:start position:0%
this time to testify on this bill on
 
06:36:47.708 --> 06:36:47.718 align:start position:0%
behalf of the
 
06:36:47.718 --> 06:36:50.110 align:start position:0%
behalf of the
department

06:36:50.110 --> 06:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:36:53.830 --> 06:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
um I think there's something that we all
 
06:36:57.190 --> 06:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
very much can agree on I've as I said
 
06:36:58.548 --> 06:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
previously we've submitted a risent
 
06:37:00.990 --> 06:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
testimony on behalf of the department
 
06:37:02.990 --> 06:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
you don't need me to read that to
 
06:37:06.030 --> 06:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
you we have been hit as a state
 
06:37:08.430 --> 06:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
approximately every six months by a
 
06:37:10.430 --> 06:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
major flood event for the last three
 
06:37:12.948 --> 06:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
years and they are devastating and some
 
06:37:15.510 --> 06:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
regions have been hit twice maybe even
 
06:37:19.670 --> 06:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
three times there is no question that
 
06:37:22.948 --> 06:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
this is more than some towns can be
 
06:37:24.910 --> 06:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
expected to handle when you lose this
 
06:37:27.708 --> 06:37:27.718 align:start position:0%
much infrastructure or for private
 
06:37:29.350 --> 06:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
property owners to deal
 
06:37:33.788 --> 06:37:33.798 align:start position:0%
with um I think we can all agree on
 
06:37:38.430 --> 06:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
that I do want to clarify some things as
 
06:37:40.910 --> 06:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron stated you do not
 
06:37:44.548 --> 06:37:44.558 align:start position:0%
need a permit to remove Woody
 
06:37:48.910 --> 06:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
debris in part due to those Lost Years
 
06:37:51.310 --> 06:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
of 2020 and
 
06:37:54.150 --> 06:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
2021 we have not had a lot of out
 
06:37:55.910 --> 06:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
Outreach and education to
 
06:37:58.910 --> 06:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
dpws people didn't get together in 2020
 
06:38:02.628 --> 06:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
so we didn't have training of town
 
06:38:05.110 --> 06:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
officials in the aftermath in the labor
 
06:38:06.670 --> 06:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
market we've had we're hearing a lot
 
06:38:09.190 --> 06:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
that towns have lost their entire DPW
 
06:38:11.548 --> 06:38:11.558 align:start position:0%
sections they can't find
 
06:38:15.110 --> 06:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
people what this means is towns don't
 
06:38:17.030 --> 06:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
always know what they can and can't do
 
06:38:18.788 --> 06:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
this is one of our biggest hurdles
 
06:38:21.070 --> 06:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
because the simple fact of the matter is
 
06:38:22.788 --> 06:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
all of these Bridges and all of these
 
06:38:24.590 --> 06:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
culs that are currently block locked up
 
06:38:28.110 --> 06:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
with Woody debris when we see them we
 
06:38:30.350 --> 06:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
are the ones who are saying oh my gosh
 
06:38:33.548 --> 06:38:33.558 align:start position:0%
please get in there and get that out no
 
06:38:36.510 --> 06:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
you cannot take please do not take heavy
 
06:38:38.750 --> 06:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
equipment into the stream bed you can
 
06:38:41.310 --> 06:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
take it onto the crossing you can take
 
06:38:44.430 --> 06:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
it into the immediately adjacent areas
 
06:38:46.910 --> 06:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
if we needed to give someone emergency
 
06:38:49.388 --> 06:38:49.398 align:start position:0%
authorization to get them in there we
 
06:38:52.750 --> 06:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
could do that that is not a formal
 
06:38:55.110 --> 06:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
application process well we do have a
 
06:38:58.110 --> 06:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
form there is no fee there is no butter
 
06:38:59.990 --> 06:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
notification there is no engineer
 
06:39:03.030 --> 06:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
required if you need temporary access to
 
06:39:05.430 --> 06:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
get in there and clear something by all
 
06:39:07.948 --> 06:39:07.958 align:start position:0%
means we have a process to do that in
 
06:39:11.230 --> 06:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
the aftermath of an event we very
 
06:39:14.910 --> 06:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend clean your culverts
 
06:39:17.910 --> 06:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
and crossings speaking of that county of
 
06:39:20.190 --> 06:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
the state some of you may have been here
 
06:39:22.830 --> 06:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
and may remember that when the Cold
 
06:39:25.468 --> 06:39:25.478 align:start position:0%
River had its first extreme flood of the
 
06:39:29.510 --> 06:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
last oh decade 15 years it wasn't
 
06:39:31.750 --> 06:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
because just of a rain event it was an
 
06:39:31.760 --> 06:39:33.468 align:start position:0%
because just of a rain event it was an
unmaintained

06:39:33.468 --> 06:39:33.478 align:start position:0%
unmaintained
 
06:39:36.468 --> 06:39:36.478 align:start position:0%
Culvert that could have been maintained
 
06:39:38.150 --> 06:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
there was no rules keeping it from being
 
06:39:41.670 --> 06:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
maintained it had simply been neglected
 
06:39:43.948 --> 06:39:43.958 align:start position:0%
we understand that it is for this reason
 
06:39:45.628 --> 06:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
that we have an entire section of our
 
06:39:49.750 --> 06:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
rules already existing which if you
 
06:39:52.548 --> 06:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
would like to look it up is Environ EnV
 
06:39:58.388 --> 06:39:58.398 align:start position:0%
environmental en v- WT as in Wetlands
 
06:40:01.510 --> 06:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
315 these are our emergency procedures
 
06:40:04.350 --> 06:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
in accordance with
 
06:40:06.948 --> 06:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
3154 those are things where if in the
 
06:40:10.070 --> 06:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
aftermath of an event you notice that
 
06:40:12.430 --> 06:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
there is damage to a structure that
 
06:40:15.150 --> 06:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
needs repair you can send us photographs
 
06:40:17.270 --> 06:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
and an email and a phone call and we
 
06:40:20.510 --> 06:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
will provide the paper approval a paper
 
06:40:22.590 --> 06:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
copy that you can then submit if you
 
06:40:26.030 --> 06:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
need to submit paperwork to to FEMA for
 
06:40:29.430 --> 06:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
funding so that you have the legal
 
06:40:31.510 --> 06:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
cover section
 
06:40:36.948 --> 06:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
3155 clearly states that in the actual
 
06:40:39.948 --> 06:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
event and it was mentioned what is a
 
06:40:42.868 --> 06:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
disaster um it's a disaster if you're in
 
06:40:45.708 --> 06:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
the middle of it frankly most of our
 
06:40:47.750 --> 06:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
stuff hasn't been Statewide and please
 
06:40:49.230 --> 06:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
consider that when the governor declares
 
06:40:51.750 --> 06:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
a disaster he declares it after the
 
06:40:53.150 --> 06:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
event in accordance with federal
 
06:40:54.750 --> 06:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
regulations based on the amount of
 
06:40:58.110 --> 06:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
funding there is no in the moment no one
 
06:41:01.670 --> 06:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
knows nor do we expect someone to think
 
06:41:03.948 --> 06:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
do I have a disaster declaration yet
 
06:41:05.468 --> 06:41:05.478 align:start position:0%
because you don't have time because
 
06:41:07.190 --> 06:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're trying to protect your people or
 
06:41:09.510 --> 06:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
you're trying to protect your property
 
06:41:11.788 --> 06:41:11.798 align:start position:0%
that is not an exp expectation that we
 
06:41:15.230 --> 06:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
have if there is an imminent risk to
 
06:41:18.150 --> 06:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
people and property that is how it is
 
06:41:20.670 --> 06:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
written one is imminent the other is
 
06:41:24.150 --> 06:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
immediate if there's immediate risk our
 
06:41:28.868 --> 06:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
rules say do the work you need to do to
 
06:41:31.830 --> 06:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
mitigate the risk we don't figure
 
06:41:33.788 --> 06:41:33.798 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to do much more than
 
06:41:35.990 --> 06:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
what's necessary to mitigate the risk
 
06:41:38.310 --> 06:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
because you don't have time especially
 
06:41:40.788 --> 06:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
if you're a town or a DPW who has
 
06:41:42.670 --> 06:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
multiple Crossings who are at risk or
 
06:41:44.670 --> 06:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
multiple resources you might be
 
06:41:46.948 --> 06:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services if you emergency
 
06:41:49.150 --> 06:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
services and you've got alarms going off
 
06:41:50.948 --> 06:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
all over town for people who are
 
06:41:53.150 --> 06:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
stranded you can only do what is
 
06:41:55.590 --> 06:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
necessary in each spot you're not going
 
06:41:58.670 --> 06:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
to do more but our rules clearly state
 
06:42:02.990 --> 06:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the event do what you need to do
 
06:42:05.628 --> 06:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
to secure the
 
06:42:08.830 --> 06:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
situation and then you report afterwards
 
06:42:10.430 --> 06:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
we have noted that our rules currently
 
06:42:13.070 --> 06:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
say towns have 10 days to report private
 
06:42:16.110 --> 06:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
individuals have 30 days to report we
 
06:42:17.788 --> 06:42:17.798 align:start position:0%
will be changing that it doesn't make
 
06:42:19.788 --> 06:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
sense that the towns only have by rule
 
06:42:22.868 --> 06:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
10 days to be quite honest we have been
 
06:42:27.510 --> 06:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
taking Town reports from the 2021
 
06:42:31.030 --> 06:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
floods and we are not pursuing any
 
06:42:32.788 --> 06:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
ramifications if a town is reporting
 
06:42:35.510 --> 06:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
their 2021 emergency damage to us
 
06:42:38.150 --> 06:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
because they have to in order to qualify
 
06:42:41.708 --> 06:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
for FEMA Aid we are simply accepting it
 
06:42:43.830 --> 06:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
and giving them the acknowledgement
 
06:42:46.708 --> 06:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
letter they need to complete their FEMA
 
06:42:48.868 --> 06:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
applications we have been working very
 
06:42:51.030 --> 06:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
closely of late
 
06:42:53.350 --> 06:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
with uh particularly eight New Hampshire
 
06:42:55.230 --> 06:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
home land Security emergency management
 
06:42:58.190 --> 06:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
to try to provide better tools and
 
06:43:00.670 --> 06:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
better education on these issues it all
 
06:43:02.510 --> 06:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
is going to come down to education um
 
06:43:04.270 --> 06:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be pre-education because
 
06:43:05.510 --> 06:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're not going to learn about it in
 
06:43:05.520 --> 06:43:06.270 align:start position:0%
you're not going to learn about it in
the

06:43:06.270 --> 06:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:43:09.590 --> 06:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
moment we are developing an
 
06:43:12.110 --> 06:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
online reporting tool for the after
 
06:43:14.030 --> 06:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
action reports to come into us which
 
06:43:16.070 --> 06:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
will allow us to expedite the response
 
06:43:17.788 --> 06:43:17.798 align:start position:0%
to folks to get them the paperwork they
 
06:43:21.868 --> 06:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
need which says yes during the event you
 
06:43:24.388 --> 06:43:24.398 align:start position:0%
needed to do this you met the law when
 
06:43:28.110 --> 06:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
you did it we have offered that we
 
06:43:31.830 --> 06:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
currently have uh New Hampshire dot user
 
06:43:35.190 --> 06:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
testing that that is going to go live
 
06:43:38.388 --> 06:43:38.398 align:start position:0%
this spring um we are working out the
 
06:43:43.270 --> 06:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
bugs so those rules that we have they're
 
06:43:47.070 --> 06:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
not new they're about 30 years old the
 
06:43:49.350 --> 06:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
problem is actually that no one even
 
06:43:51.788 --> 06:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
knew they were there we have we have not
 
06:43:54.830 --> 06:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
had a chance to let the dpws the folks
 
06:43:57.708 --> 06:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
who are on the front lines know about it
 
06:44:02.310 --> 06:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of this in regards to
 
06:44:06.868 --> 06:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
your um your Fields your your vegetable
 
06:44:10.430 --> 06:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
corn fields hay Fields your
 
06:44:14.030 --> 06:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
barns if the river jumps
 
06:44:17.510 --> 06:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
Channel and cuts a new channel I can
 
06:44:19.948 --> 06:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
give you an example from this last event
 
06:44:21.510 --> 06:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
Gentleman on the Enders
 
06:44:24.430 --> 06:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
scogan Golf Course
 
06:44:25.910 --> 06:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
asked if you could build the berm along
 
06:44:27.190 --> 06:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
the top of the river as the Water
 
06:44:28.388 --> 06:44:28.398 align:start position:0%
started to come
 
06:44:30.788 --> 06:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
up he built the BM across the prop of
 
06:44:32.990 --> 06:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
the river cross it was not in our
 
06:44:34.670 --> 06:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the answer was absolutely
 
06:44:37.030 --> 06:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
if you think you can put a dyke in to
 
06:44:38.070 --> 06:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
protect your
 
06:44:40.628 --> 06:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
property he they attempted to get this
 
06:44:43.430 --> 06:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
done that River still cut a swath across
 
06:44:46.868 --> 06:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
this gentleman's golf course it
 
06:44:49.788 --> 06:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
is unspeakable the damage that it did
 
06:44:50.990 --> 06:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what they're going to
 
06:44:53.548 --> 06:44:53.558 align:start position:0%
do it cut a new channel that channel is
 
06:44:56.310 --> 06:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
dry now that's not our
 
06:44:59.230 --> 06:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the damage one of the other
 
06:45:01.350 --> 06:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
aspects that we need to explain and that
 
06:45:04.150 --> 06:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
we need to educate folks on is if it
 
06:45:06.110 --> 06:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
dumped debris if the river cut a new
 
06:45:08.590 --> 06:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
channel but that channel is not the new
 
06:45:08.600 --> 06:45:09.590 align:start position:0%
channel but that channel is not the new
wet

06:45:09.590 --> 06:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
wet
 
06:45:12.350 --> 06:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
Channel then we are not exerting
 
06:45:15.190 --> 06:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over that channel if the
 
06:45:17.388 --> 06:45:17.398 align:start position:0%
river cut a new channel and that is now
 
06:45:18.670 --> 06:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
the wet
 
06:45:21.230 --> 06:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
Channel then I would refer folks to the
 
06:45:22.468 --> 06:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
example that
 
06:45:22.478 --> 06:45:24.270 align:start position:0%
example that
happened

06:45:24.270 --> 06:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
happened
 
06:45:27.350 --> 06:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
roughly 2005 2006 on the Suncook River
 
06:45:28.830 --> 06:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
in Epsom and Chai
 
06:45:31.070 --> 06:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
Chester and if you think a homeowner is
 
06:45:33.628 --> 06:45:33.638 align:start position:0%
going to go out and fix that that River
 
06:45:36.030 --> 06:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
Channel bed dropped 32
 
06:45:38.548 --> 06:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
feet in these flood events when you are
 
06:45:41.628 --> 06:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
dealing with River Dynamics the reason
 
06:45:45.230 --> 06:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
the long-term solution has an engineer
 
06:45:46.868 --> 06:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
is because once the river gets out of
 
06:45:49.788 --> 06:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
its Channel and it hits material that
 
06:45:52.510 --> 06:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
has not previously been subject to those
 
06:45:54.788 --> 06:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
forces it is very
 
06:45:57.548 --> 06:45:57.558 align:start position:0%
Dynamic if it actually jumps and cuts a
 
06:45:57.558 --> 06:45:58.670 align:start position:0%
Dynamic if it actually jumps and cuts a
new

06:45:58.670 --> 06:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
new
 
06:46:02.310 --> 06:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
channel then before you put it back you
 
06:46:03.948 --> 06:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
probably have a little research to do
 
06:46:06.468 --> 06:46:06.478 align:start position:0%
about how you're going to actually keep
 
06:46:09.430 --> 06:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
it from going which is now the lower
 
06:46:09.440 --> 06:46:11.468 align:start position:0%
it from going which is now the lower
elevation

06:46:11.468 --> 06:46:11.478 align:start position:0%
elevation
 
06:46:14.510 --> 06:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
Channel and how you're going to
 
06:46:17.628 --> 06:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
stabilize where it's make sure it it
 
06:46:19.910 --> 06:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
stays in its in its
 
06:46:22.788 --> 06:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
previous um that is no little no
 
06:46:25.350 --> 06:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
homeowners going going to do that no no
 
06:46:28.830 --> 06:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
enterprising farmer is going to do that
 
06:46:31.590 --> 06:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
um and if they do and it
 
06:46:34.150 --> 06:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
fails we live in a very litigious
 
06:46:36.110 --> 06:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
society and that's the other reason that
 
06:46:38.030 --> 06:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do it it's because
 
06:46:41.310 --> 06:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to get it
 
06:46:46.468 --> 06:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
wrong so yes it is an exceptionally we
 
06:46:49.990 --> 06:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
are as a state taking it on the chin and
 
06:46:52.190 --> 06:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
we are taking it on the chin
 
06:46:53.990 --> 06:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um
 
06:46:56.388 --> 06:46:56.398 align:start position:0%
um we need to do a better job of
 
06:46:58.670 --> 06:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
educating about what can and cannot be
 
06:47:01.708 --> 06:47:01.718 align:start position:0%
done in the moment before the moment
 
06:47:05.590 --> 06:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
gets here as Preparatory work that Woody
 
06:47:08.270 --> 06:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
debris uh seriously I've seen enough
 
06:47:10.510 --> 06:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
photos in the last six months where we
 
06:47:12.548 --> 06:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
are horrified by what is still out there
 
06:47:15.468 --> 06:47:15.478 align:start position:0%
in Channel and it needs to come out we
 
06:47:17.830 --> 06:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
also understand that there is a fear not
 
06:47:20.510 --> 06:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
of our permitting what we're hearing is
 
06:47:25.750 --> 06:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
anything we do if FEMA doesn't if FEMA
 
06:47:27.388 --> 06:47:27.398 align:start position:0%
doesn't think it was legal they won't
 
06:47:30.430 --> 06:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
pay for it and then we can't afford the
 
06:47:33.430 --> 06:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
funds we don't have everybody is cash
 
06:47:36.948 --> 06:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
wrapped um what we hear the feedback we
 
06:47:39.990 --> 06:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
hear as an agency it's not about what it
 
06:47:42.788 --> 06:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
takes for us to get the permit because
 
06:47:44.990 --> 06:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the moment you don't need the permit
 
06:47:47.070 --> 06:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
and in the moment you don't you're not
 
06:47:48.510 --> 06:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
going to have an
 
06:47:52.830 --> 06:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
engineer the problem is um people are
 
06:47:55.270 --> 06:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
afraid to take action if it puts their
 
06:47:57.670 --> 06:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
ability for funding at risk because they
 
06:48:00.350 --> 06:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
don't have a tax base to pay for the
 
06:48:02.590 --> 06:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
damages that their towns are taking to
 
06:48:02.600 --> 06:48:03.670 align:start position:0%
damages that their towns are taking to
their

06:48:03.670 --> 06:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:48:06.788 --> 06:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um as individual home
 
06:48:09.830 --> 06:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
homeowners what we hear most often is
 
06:48:12.350 --> 06:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
can you help it's not how do I get a
 
06:48:16.190 --> 06:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
permit it's can you direct me to help so
 
06:48:19.708 --> 06:48:19.718 align:start position:0%
we get this um our as a department our
 
06:48:21.830 --> 06:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
position on this is we've already got
 
06:48:23.510 --> 06:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
rules in place that say you don't need a
 
06:48:26.388 --> 06:48:26.398 align:start position:0%
permit for these things they're there
 
06:48:28.510 --> 06:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's very unfortunate and we need to do
 
06:48:31.548 --> 06:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
a better job in combination with
 
06:48:34.190 --> 06:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
HSM conservation commissions any group
 
06:48:36.868 --> 06:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
that we can find to let people know how
 
06:48:38.030 --> 06:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
to handle
 
06:48:42.388 --> 06:48:42.398 align:start position:0%
this um but those rules are already in
 
06:48:42.398 --> 06:48:44.830 align:start position:0%
this um but those rules are already in
place

06:48:44.830 --> 06:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:48:47.590 --> 06:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
so the only thing that we see risk of
 
06:48:50.430 --> 06:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
this statute is that it damages folks
 
06:48:52.110 --> 06:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
ability to provide the paperwork that
 
06:48:54.910 --> 06:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
they need to apply for their FEMA funds
 
06:48:56.468 --> 06:48:56.478 align:start position:0%
and it damages their ability to be
 
06:48:58.670 --> 06:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
covered under our Cooperative agreements
 
06:49:00.910 --> 06:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
with the US Army Corps of Engineers and
 
06:49:03.910 --> 06:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
these are definitely rivers and streams
 
06:49:07.150 --> 06:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
unquestionably these are jurisdictional
 
06:49:11.868 --> 06:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
areas um so their Dynamic systems the
 
06:49:13.310 --> 06:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
long-term repair of these and the
 
06:49:15.868 --> 06:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
long-term management of these should be
 
06:49:19.190 --> 06:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
done in a coordinated Manner and yeah
 
06:49:21.868 --> 06:49:21.878 align:start position:0%
there's probably another there's
 
06:49:23.468 --> 06:49:23.478 align:start position:0%
probably another conversation that needs
 
06:49:25.990 --> 06:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be had long term about how do we
 
06:49:26.000 --> 06:49:27.110 align:start position:0%
to be had long term about how do we
coordinate

06:49:27.110 --> 06:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
coordinate
 
06:49:30.388 --> 06:49:30.398 align:start position:0%
efforts to best manage these situations
 
06:49:32.270 --> 06:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure our Crossings are properly
 
06:49:34.788 --> 06:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
sized so they don't blow out in two
 
06:49:36.230 --> 06:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
consecutive storm
 
06:49:38.310 --> 06:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
events um to
 
06:49:40.868 --> 06:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
prioritize the sequencing of Culvert
 
06:49:43.230 --> 06:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
Replacements so that you don't upssize
 
06:49:45.350 --> 06:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
the Upstream culverts before you upssize
 
06:49:47.788 --> 06:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
the downstream CTS there's a lot of
 
06:49:49.628 --> 06:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
planning that needs to
 
06:49:52.350 --> 06:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
happen um and there's a lot of
 
06:49:54.110 --> 06:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
discussion about how we fund these
 
06:49:56.150 --> 06:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
things but I can tell you right now that
 
06:49:59.070 --> 06:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
the exemption that this would give you
 
06:50:01.750 --> 06:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
already exists it's
 
06:50:01.760 --> 06:50:03.548 align:start position:0%
already exists it's
there

06:50:03.548 --> 06:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:50:06.110 --> 06:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
um the only thing you would do is is
 
06:50:09.468 --> 06:50:09.478 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the recovery efforts based on
 
06:50:11.510 --> 06:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
what we have currently with our our
 
06:50:14.070 --> 06:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
federal Partners in this I do also want
 
06:50:15.788 --> 06:50:15.798 align:start position:0%
to State one other thing just for the
 
06:50:18.150 --> 06:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
record more often than not when you're
 
06:50:20.310 --> 06:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with the stream you're not
 
06:50:21.548 --> 06:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
dealing with the butters you're dealing
 
06:50:23.030 --> 06:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
with land owners because the profit
 
06:50:25.070 --> 06:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
property line is the center line of the
 
06:50:27.350 --> 06:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
Stream So when you're going in to dig
 
06:50:30.030 --> 06:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
out the middle of the stream half of
 
06:50:32.310 --> 06:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
that belongs to somebody else assuming
 
06:50:34.590 --> 06:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
you stay parallel to your own property
 
06:50:39.590 --> 06:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's not just this isn't just um your
 
06:50:41.990 --> 06:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
land and if the person on the other side
 
06:50:43.948 --> 06:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
of the stream doesn't agree with
 
06:50:46.830 --> 06:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
it or they're afraid that you know if
 
06:50:48.310 --> 06:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
the river jump towards you and away from
 
06:50:50.270 --> 06:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
them and they're afraid that it's going
 
06:50:53.030 --> 06:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
to come back this also is not going
 
06:50:55.590 --> 06:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
going to this just going to lead to more
 
06:50:58.070 --> 06:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
disagreements so I appreciate and as a
 
06:50:59.468 --> 06:50:59.478 align:start position:0%
department we all appreciate where this
 
06:51:04.190 --> 06:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
is coming from and we have all heard um
 
06:51:05.948 --> 06:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
some really tragic
 
06:51:09.110 --> 06:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
stories and there is a problem to be
 
06:51:11.788 --> 06:51:11.798 align:start position:0%
solved we are do not support this bill
 
06:51:13.948 --> 06:51:13.958 align:start position:0%
because we do not believe it actually
 
06:51:16.430 --> 06:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
advances us toward that solution and I
 
06:51:17.948 --> 06:51:17.958 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take any questions you
 
06:51:17.958 --> 06:51:20.948 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take any questions you
may

06:51:20.948 --> 06:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:23.590 --> 06:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
have representative har
 
06:51:27.430 --> 06:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:51:31.548 --> 06:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
questions your letter or the letter says
 
06:51:35.910 --> 06:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
that RSA 482a provides for work in
 
06:51:39.150 --> 06:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional areas without permits I
 
06:51:41.468 --> 06:51:41.478 align:start position:0%
heard talk and I have a handout about
 
06:51:44.628 --> 06:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
large Woody material that is in the
 
06:51:46.990 --> 06:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
Stream or whatever not
 
06:51:49.548 --> 06:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
embedded I got confused is there other
 
06:51:52.190 --> 06:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
work that one can do in these events
 
06:51:54.270 --> 06:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
without per other than removing the
 
06:51:57.430 --> 06:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
large Woody material um during the
 
06:51:59.750 --> 06:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
during the event itself for instance if
 
06:52:01.230 --> 06:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
you have a bridge abutment that is
 
06:52:04.430 --> 06:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
failing and you need to put large rock
 
06:52:06.230 --> 06:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
material in front of that to prevent
 
06:52:08.388 --> 06:52:08.398 align:start position:0%
that from getting worse you can do that
 
06:52:11.468 --> 06:52:11.478 align:start position:0%
during event and Report out after so yes
 
06:52:14.670 --> 06:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
the rule is in place en nbwt
 
06:52:17.110 --> 06:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
3155 if during the event there is
 
06:52:19.510 --> 06:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
something taking damage if a structures
 
06:52:22.070 --> 06:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
Foundation becomes exposed because the
 
06:52:25.510 --> 06:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
river has a road Ed to it you can place
 
06:52:28.270 --> 06:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
material in front of that structure in
 
06:52:30.388 --> 06:52:30.398 align:start position:0%
order to reinforce that foundation and
 
06:52:32.830 --> 06:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
tell us after those rules are in
 
06:52:37.948 --> 06:52:37.958 align:start position:0%
place follow up follow up there was also
 
06:52:40.150 --> 06:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
discussion and in the letter about
 
06:52:42.430 --> 06:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
emergency permits emergency
 
06:52:45.388 --> 06:52:45.398 align:start position:0%
authorizations I wondered is that uh
 
06:52:48.190 --> 06:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
permit available to complete online and
 
06:52:50.110 --> 06:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
do you have a time frame like how long
 
06:52:52.548 --> 06:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
it takes for you to respond to it it is
 
06:52:55.070 --> 06:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
a onepage form that you can file online
 
06:52:57.350 --> 06:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
we also take them as phone calls
 
06:52:58.948 --> 06:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
frequently come in as phone calls and
 
06:53:00.628 --> 06:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
emails where we'll usually ask them to
 
06:53:02.230 --> 06:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
do the form just so that we have
 
06:53:04.150 --> 06:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
logistical information like who's the
 
06:53:04.160 --> 06:53:05.468 align:start position:0%
logistical information like who's the
contact

06:53:05.468 --> 06:53:05.478 align:start position:0%
contact
 
06:53:08.430 --> 06:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
person um where is it uh brief
 
06:53:12.310 --> 06:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
description of what you'd like to do and
 
06:53:14.948 --> 06:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
we attempt to turn those
 
06:53:19.750 --> 06:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
around within 24 to 48 hours um we are
 
06:53:22.708 --> 06:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
actually they currently I think the max
 
06:53:24.708 --> 06:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
maximum time that we allow ourselves by
 
06:53:27.310 --> 06:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
rule is 5 days but frankly you're an
 
06:53:29.230 --> 06:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
emergency we're going to look at these
 
06:53:31.868 --> 06:53:31.878 align:start position:0%
things and frequently we'll turn them
 
06:53:35.190 --> 06:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
around faster because you might not have
 
06:53:38.030 --> 06:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
five days worth a wait thank you
 
06:53:38.040 --> 06:53:39.230 align:start position:0%
five days worth a wait thank you
appreciate

06:53:39.230 --> 06:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
06:53:43.270 --> 06:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
it anyone else representative rung then
 
06:53:43.280 --> 06:53:44.628 align:start position:0%
it anyone else representative rung then
representative

06:53:44.628 --> 06:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:53:47.190 --> 06:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
gby thank you Mr
 
06:53:49.548 --> 06:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Miss Force for
 
06:53:52.788 --> 06:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what you've said
 
06:53:55.628 --> 06:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
you've described seems very reasonable
 
06:53:59.788 --> 06:53:59.798 align:start position:0%
um very um attentive to the needs but
 
06:54:02.948 --> 06:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
yet I I hear representative Aaron and my
 
06:54:05.510 --> 06:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
heartbreaks for those people who are
 
06:54:08.548 --> 06:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
suffering um the devastation during a
 
06:54:12.868 --> 06:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
flood so where's where's the how can we
 
06:54:14.070 --> 06:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
bridge that
 
06:54:17.150 --> 06:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
disconnect um in what you're saying and
 
06:54:19.548 --> 06:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
what their needs are you you said you
 
06:54:21.670 --> 06:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
know you're looking I mean can is there
 
06:54:24.150 --> 06:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
a solution you prop
 
06:54:26.468 --> 06:54:26.478 align:start position:0%
posst the Department's what the
 
06:54:28.110 --> 06:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
department is already working on again
 
06:54:30.150 --> 06:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
is a we're trying to develop online
 
06:54:32.990 --> 06:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
tools so that people can immediately go
 
06:54:35.548 --> 06:54:35.558 align:start position:0%
in you know whoever the town official is
 
06:54:38.628 --> 06:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
can bring in some photos and location
 
06:54:40.628 --> 06:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
data and someone in a town office can be
 
06:54:42.030 --> 06:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
doing this while they're out doing the
 
06:54:44.628 --> 06:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
work that is the after action
 
06:54:47.230 --> 06:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
reporting um we're trying to work with
 
06:54:49.708 --> 06:54:49.718 align:start position:0%
HSM to work on better fact sheets we
 
06:54:51.430 --> 06:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
need to develop better
 
06:54:55.750 --> 06:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
education um frankly we need to develop
 
06:54:57.910 --> 06:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
tools that help towns
 
06:55:00.628 --> 06:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
identify their infrastructure weaknesses
 
06:55:02.070 --> 06:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
on their stream
 
06:55:06.750 --> 06:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
Crossings so that they can look
 
06:55:09.628 --> 06:55:09.638 align:start position:0%
for sequencing and prioritization and
 
06:55:11.788 --> 06:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
how things should be repaired or
 
06:55:15.430 --> 06:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
replaced um so many times in these
 
06:55:18.948 --> 06:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
events undersized Crossings
 
06:55:21.750 --> 06:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
non-maintained Crossings are where this
 
06:55:23.628 --> 06:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
06:55:25.350 --> 06:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's not that they're not maintained or
 
06:55:28.270 --> 06:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
they're undersized because the towns
 
06:55:28.280 --> 06:55:30.388 align:start position:0%
they're undersized because the towns
don't

06:55:30.388 --> 06:55:30.398 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:55:33.830 --> 06:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
care um and I say this as this is what I
 
06:55:36.868 --> 06:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
we hear when folks contact us the pleas
 
06:55:40.190 --> 06:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
that we are hearing from those who are
 
06:55:40.200 --> 06:55:41.990 align:start position:0%
that we are hearing from those who are
calling

06:55:41.990 --> 06:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
calling
 
06:55:44.430 --> 06:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
us the town didn't have money to replace
 
06:55:47.310 --> 06:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
it you don't have a lot of funds right
 
06:55:48.708 --> 06:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
now since
 
06:55:52.628 --> 06:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
2020 the the cost of building the cost
 
06:55:54.708 --> 06:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
of labor
 
06:55:58.190 --> 06:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
materials is astronomical it is
 
06:56:01.468 --> 06:56:01.478 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing um that is more often than
 
06:56:04.430 --> 06:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
not what prohibits corrective or
 
06:56:07.310 --> 06:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
preventative measures it's not just
 
06:56:10.150 --> 06:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
because they need to get a permit a
 
06:56:12.190 --> 06:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
structural replacement for us is a
 
06:56:13.430 --> 06:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
permit by
 
06:56:15.750 --> 06:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
notification structural replacement with
 
06:56:18.910 --> 06:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
upsizing on a major on a on a large
 
06:56:21.750 --> 06:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
stream or a river yeah at that point
 
06:56:22.750 --> 06:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit more more than a
 
06:56:24.750 --> 06:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
permit by notification but we do
 
06:56:27.270 --> 06:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
everything we can to streamline the
 
06:56:30.430 --> 06:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
permitting of um expanded
 
06:56:33.388 --> 06:56:33.398 align:start position:0%
Crossings because it is an environmental
 
06:56:36.230 --> 06:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
gain for us it does the environment no
 
06:56:41.150 --> 06:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
good for these things to fail so our our
 
06:56:43.350 --> 06:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
Focus right now in in solving this
 
06:56:45.708 --> 06:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
problem and unfortunately we're already
 
06:56:47.670 --> 06:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
well behind the game and I when I say
 
06:56:49.750 --> 06:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
that I don't just mean Dees I mean as a
 
06:56:55.670 --> 06:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
state um there are so much damage to be
 
06:56:59.270 --> 06:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
repaired and not enough people it seems
 
06:57:00.230 --> 06:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
to do
 
06:57:04.270 --> 06:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
it and not enough funds to pay for it
 
06:57:08.990 --> 06:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's what we hear um we have already
 
06:57:11.628 --> 06:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of
 
06:57:14.708 --> 06:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
Dees the most effective thing that we
 
06:57:17.190 --> 06:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
can sometimes do is get out of the way
 
06:57:18.948 --> 06:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
and we have rules that have done that to
 
06:57:22.830 --> 06:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
the best of our ability they're there um
 
06:57:26.190 --> 06:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
um the things that we hear about funding
 
06:57:26.200 --> 06:57:28.468 align:start position:0%
um the things that we hear about funding
and

06:57:28.468 --> 06:57:28.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:57:34.628 --> 06:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:37.110 --> 06:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
us who
 
06:57:39.110 --> 06:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr thank you
 
06:57:41.430 --> 06:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question um
 
06:57:42.990 --> 06:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
definitely the the thing that stuck out
 
06:57:46.190 --> 06:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
to me was the um the concern um in your
 
06:57:48.310 --> 06:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
testimonies is the concern over you know
 
06:57:49.788 --> 06:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
how are things going to get paid for and
 
06:57:52.948 --> 06:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
the fact that this may um in inhibit the
 
06:57:56.670 --> 06:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
ability to apply for FEMA funds can I
 
06:57:59.230 --> 06:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
can you describe for me the process of
 
06:58:01.708 --> 06:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
how you know following a natural
 
06:58:04.830 --> 06:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
disaster um the the Army Corps of
 
06:58:07.190 --> 06:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
Engineers permit is issued and then the
 
06:58:08.750 --> 06:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
the FEMA funds
 
06:58:12.788 --> 06:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
follow so hm would be better to speak to
 
06:58:15.110 --> 06:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
this than I would and what we have
 
06:58:19.468 --> 06:58:19.478 align:start position:0%
learned through the last six months to
 
06:58:21.310 --> 06:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
probably now it's
 
06:58:23.948 --> 06:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
probably closer to 18 months time
 
06:58:27.430 --> 06:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
flies um FEMA has changed some of their
 
06:58:29.830 --> 06:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements so what we find
 
06:58:32.590 --> 06:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
frequently now is as part of a FEMA
 
06:58:36.590 --> 06:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
application for funds they need written
 
06:58:38.788 --> 06:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
verification that the work that was
 
06:58:40.830 --> 06:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
completed complies with environmental
 
06:58:44.510 --> 06:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
law within the state and the Army Corps
 
06:58:46.628 --> 06:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
we have a general permit with the Army
 
06:58:49.110 --> 06:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
Corps issued to us every five years the
 
06:58:51.990 --> 06:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
most recent was issued August of August
 
06:58:54.468 --> 06:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
SE seber of last year September 29th of
 
06:58:57.788 --> 06:58:57.798 align:start position:0%
last year so that's valid for another
 
06:59:01.110 --> 06:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
four years 6 months if you have an
 
06:59:03.868 --> 06:59:03.878 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization or you have
 
06:59:06.230 --> 06:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
paperwork indicating that you qualified
 
06:59:06.240 --> 06:59:07.430 align:start position:0%
paperwork indicating that you qualified
under

06:59:07.430 --> 06:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:59:12.110 --> 06:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
315 05 uh actions during an emergency
 
06:59:14.430 --> 06:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
then that satisfies the Army Corps
 
06:59:14.440 --> 06:59:16.070 align:start position:0%
then that satisfies the Army Corps
General

06:59:16.070 --> 06:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
General
 
06:59:19.230 --> 06:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
permit so that can be pointed to so the
 
06:59:20.830 --> 06:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
important part is getting that paperwork
 
06:59:22.750 --> 06:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
into folks hands the other thing that we
 
06:59:23.910 --> 06:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
are frequently
 
06:59:26.070 --> 06:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
seeing is that they need paperwork that
 
06:59:28.030 --> 06:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
says it wasn't jurisdictional it's not
 
06:59:30.230 --> 06:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
just that we're reporting now that this
 
06:59:33.190 --> 06:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
was in jurisdiction and it meets the law
 
06:59:34.628 --> 06:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
which means it would be under our
 
06:59:36.990 --> 06:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
agreement with the Army Corps but they
 
06:59:38.830 --> 06:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
also now sometimes need paperwork saying
 
06:59:40.750 --> 06:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
that this wasn't in our jurisdiction at
 
06:59:43.670 --> 06:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
all which has increased our need again
 
06:59:44.910 --> 06:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
for this
 
06:59:48.070 --> 06:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
online an easy online filing system that
 
06:59:50.150 --> 06:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
people can come to us with so that we
 
06:59:51.708 --> 06:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
can look at it and sometimes simply
 
06:59:53.750 --> 06:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
issue an acknowledgement yep you did
 
06:59:55.270 --> 06:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
work and it didn't need a permit because
 
06:59:56.910 --> 06:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
it wasn't in
 
07:00:01.150 --> 07:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so it's documentation is
 
07:00:05.628 --> 07:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
key for a followup thank you um I'm I'm
 
07:00:07.310 --> 07:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
trying to understand as well the piece
 
07:00:09.750 --> 07:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
about you know how the FEMA funds flow
 
07:00:12.548 --> 07:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
to the homeowners or the property owners
 
07:00:14.750 --> 07:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
or the municipalities that are
 
07:00:17.430 --> 07:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
impacted that is a question for HSM I
 
07:00:19.948 --> 07:00:19.958 align:start position:0%
know what HSM needs from us to complete
 
07:00:21.510 --> 07:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
the applications but when it comes to
 
07:00:22.750 --> 07:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
07:00:25.590 --> 07:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
dispersement or applications for Aid
 
07:00:29.430 --> 07:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:32.830 --> 07:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
territories Yeah question quick one
 
07:00:34.468 --> 07:00:34.478 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for your
 
07:00:36.990 --> 07:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh testimony I just have a a question
 
07:00:38.830 --> 07:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
and I apologize if you've already Co
 
07:00:40.548 --> 07:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
covered this but representative Aaron
 
07:00:45.388 --> 07:00:45.398 align:start position:0%
was talking about you know uh the idea
 
07:00:49.030 --> 07:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
of working and clearing streams during
 
07:00:51.270 --> 07:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know you you referenced immediate
 
07:00:51.280 --> 07:00:53.270 align:start position:0%
you know you you referenced immediate
aftermath

07:00:53.270 --> 07:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
aftermath
 
07:00:55.628 --> 07:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
but nobody's going to how what does that
 
07:00:58.270 --> 07:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
mean exactly immediate aftermath
 
07:01:01.030 --> 07:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
and did you cover that I'm sorry so for
 
07:01:02.990 --> 07:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
the immediate aftermath for
 
07:01:06.110 --> 07:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
us we're still working with people and
 
07:01:07.990 --> 07:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
we are still getting
 
07:01:12.670 --> 07:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
requests for the latest uh gorum event
 
07:01:15.388 --> 07:01:15.398 align:start position:0%
so for what it's worth we're still
 
07:01:18.150 --> 07:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
functioning is if we're in the immediate
 
07:01:22.708 --> 07:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
aftermath of in some cases the December
 
07:01:27.030 --> 07:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
21st flood event um as well as the early
 
07:01:29.190 --> 07:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
January we are
 
07:01:32.388 --> 07:01:32.398 align:start position:0%
not we recognize that the greater the
 
07:01:34.548 --> 07:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
disaster the longer it takes for you to
 
07:01:35.788 --> 07:01:35.798 align:start position:0%
discover some
 
07:01:39.708 --> 07:01:39.718 align:start position:0%
things so we are still receiving
 
07:01:41.628 --> 07:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
requests for emergency authorization and
 
07:01:43.430 --> 07:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
processing them as emergency
 
07:01:46.030 --> 07:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
authorization requests and not requiring
 
07:01:49.150 --> 07:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
full permits as as things come in so
 
07:01:51.708 --> 07:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
just quick follow up followup up um Okay
 
07:01:55.990 --> 07:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
so so to clarify um this pretty much
 
07:02:00.030 --> 07:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
whole year could be the immediate
 
07:02:02.548 --> 07:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
aftermath and as I as I said we're
 
07:02:05.190 --> 07:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
actually still taking we are still
 
07:02:06.948 --> 07:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
receiving and accepting after action
 
07:02:09.510 --> 07:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
reports for work that towns did in July
 
07:02:09.520 --> 07:02:10.990 align:start position:0%
reports for work that towns did in July
of

07:02:10.990 --> 07:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:02:11.000 --> 07:02:13.070 align:start position:0%
of
2021

07:02:13.070 --> 07:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
2021
 
07:02:15.670 --> 07:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily permitting new work
 
07:02:17.548 --> 07:02:17.558 align:start position:0%
but we're still taking it as their
 
07:02:21.150 --> 07:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
reporting because they were so behind
 
07:02:24.310 --> 07:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
and getting things done
 
07:02:26.910 --> 07:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
um depending on the rain events it's
 
07:02:28.990 --> 07:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
like a it it's almost like a rolling
 
07:02:32.230 --> 07:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
action across the state as Things become
 
07:02:34.670 --> 07:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
available the rules allow us to continue
 
07:02:37.910 --> 07:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
to keep this open um I'm sorry if that's
 
07:02:40.110 --> 07:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
not quite what you're looking for
 
07:02:43.590 --> 07:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
but just I'm sorry this is the last one
 
07:02:47.388 --> 07:02:47.398 align:start position:0%
so you know and I I just just because
 
07:02:48.708 --> 07:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:02:51.948 --> 07:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
representative so you know a late person
 
07:02:55.670 --> 07:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
reading immediate aftermath is not going
 
07:02:58.190 --> 07:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
to think this could pertain to the whole
 
07:03:00.788 --> 07:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
year because that's not what immediate
 
07:03:03.628 --> 07:03:03.638 align:start position:0%
aftermath means I guess my question is
 
07:03:06.510 --> 07:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
is there anywhere like a website on your
 
07:03:09.270 --> 07:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
website clarifying that this is okay
 
07:03:12.110 --> 07:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
immediate aftermath oh it's really
 
07:03:16.070 --> 07:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
expanded uh much more than usual like
 
07:03:18.190 --> 07:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
our rules require that you report to us
 
07:03:20.190 --> 07:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
within five days of your discovery of
 
07:03:20.200 --> 07:03:20.868 align:start position:0%
within five days of your discovery of
the

07:03:20.868 --> 07:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:03:20.878 --> 07:03:23.310 align:start position:0%
the
need

07:03:23.310 --> 07:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
need
 
07:03:25.230 --> 07:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
so if for
 
07:03:25.240 --> 07:03:26.868 align:start position:0%
so if for
instance

07:03:26.868 --> 07:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
instance
 
07:03:29.388 --> 07:03:29.398 align:start position:0%
Berlin doesn't Discover that they have a
 
07:03:31.030 --> 07:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
ruptured pipeline that they definitely
 
07:03:33.030 --> 07:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
need to get into the water to
 
07:03:35.750 --> 07:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
fix if it happened six months ago but
 
07:03:38.388 --> 07:03:38.398 align:start position:0%
you just discovered it now as long as
 
07:03:40.948 --> 07:03:40.958 align:start position:0%
you report it to us within five days of
 
07:03:45.110 --> 07:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:49.110 --> 07:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
EA for that case if you reported it six
 
07:03:50.548 --> 07:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
days after we're probably going to ask
 
07:03:52.628 --> 07:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
you what took you so long would still
 
07:03:54.628 --> 07:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
issue the EA because environmentally we
 
07:03:55.990 --> 07:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
would prefer that that damage get
 
07:03:57.830 --> 07:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
corrected as quickly as
 
07:04:01.468 --> 07:04:01.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:06.030 --> 07:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
you anything else anyone else further
 
07:04:08.590 --> 07:04:08.600 align:start position:0%

successful in protecting their local
 
07:04:42.398 --> 07:04:43.628 align:start position:0%
successful in protecting their local
natural

07:04:43.628 --> 07:04:43.638 align:start position:0%
natural
 
07:04:45.910 --> 07:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
resources and we are opposed to this
 
07:04:48.750 --> 07:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
bill um because we believe that this
 
07:04:51.830 --> 07:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
bill is not necessary um because of
 
07:04:57.670 --> 07:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
reason stated by um Dees already um Dees
 
07:05:00.310 --> 07:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
does have a process in place called the
 
07:05:02.670 --> 07:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization and that will
 
07:05:05.190 --> 07:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
address heal um threats to Public Safety
 
07:05:07.910 --> 07:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
public health during a natural disaster
 
07:05:09.708 --> 07:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
and I've heard from a few towns that
 
07:05:12.030 --> 07:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
have used this process and they thought
 
07:05:14.030 --> 07:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
it was fine and I believe you have a
 
07:05:17.150 --> 07:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
letter from Hampton which um does state
 
07:05:18.708 --> 07:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
that they've gone through the emergency
 
07:05:20.868 --> 07:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
authorization process and felt it was
 
07:05:24.310 --> 07:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
fair speedy and again there was the the
 
07:05:27.110 --> 07:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
costs weren't associated with that
 
07:05:31.990 --> 07:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
permit um they are required to to you
 
07:05:34.670 --> 07:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
know the applicant for the Emergency
 
07:05:38.868 --> 07:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
authorization does require um a plan but
 
07:05:40.868 --> 07:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
we believe that that's very important
 
07:05:44.548 --> 07:05:44.558 align:start position:0%
because um certainly having some
 
07:05:47.110 --> 07:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
oversight in the restoration ensures
 
07:05:49.910 --> 07:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
Public Safety often times these
 
07:05:52.548 --> 07:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
well-intended cleanups can really cause
 
07:05:55.590 --> 07:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
issues to abutters or Downstream effects
 
07:05:58.230 --> 07:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
if the work is not done properly so that
 
07:06:00.788 --> 07:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
really is de's role to ensure that this
 
07:06:03.350 --> 07:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
work is done properly and without any
 
07:06:06.868 --> 07:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
sort of paperwork or notification I mean
 
07:06:09.590 --> 07:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
know a onepage form at least is that
 
07:06:12.468 --> 07:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
notification and documentation so that
 
07:06:15.628 --> 07:06:15.638 align:start position:0%
you know if FEMA comes forward we all
 
07:06:18.030 --> 07:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
the things are done properly um and
 
07:06:20.590 --> 07:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
again I also have concerns about
 
07:06:24.830 --> 07:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing the FEMA funds if um this
 
07:06:27.270 --> 07:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
permit deviates from what the Army Corps
 
07:06:29.910 --> 07:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
of Engineers is requiring so I think
 
07:06:32.070 --> 07:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's you know part of the unintended
 
07:06:34.670 --> 07:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
consequences of this bill is
 
07:06:36.830 --> 07:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
is the likelihood that there's going to
 
07:06:38.388 --> 07:06:38.398 align:start position:0%
be a lot of work that's not done
 
07:06:40.708 --> 07:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
properly is out there because the
 
07:06:44.190 --> 07:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
language is vague as well as you know
 
07:06:46.830 --> 07:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
risking some of our FEMA funds um and
 
07:06:49.788 --> 07:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
that can really be I'm sure scary to a
 
07:06:52.510 --> 07:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
lot of towns um
 
07:06:54.230 --> 07:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
I would also like everybody to keep in
 
07:06:56.430 --> 07:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
mind that um really it's New Hampshire's
 
07:06:59.830 --> 07:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
Wetlands that play a critical role in
 
07:07:02.030 --> 07:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
mitigating our flood waters and they
 
07:07:04.948 --> 07:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
help retain and store water during our
 
07:07:07.788 --> 07:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events so it's really
 
07:07:09.910 --> 07:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
important we protect these resources and
 
07:07:12.388 --> 07:07:12.398 align:start position:0%
our our streams and our shorelands are
 
07:07:15.110 --> 07:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
all part of that water system that we
 
07:07:17.548 --> 07:07:17.558 align:start position:0%
really believes critical to have
 
07:07:21.070 --> 07:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
oversight to have documentation and to
 
07:07:24.310 --> 07:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
to do things properly and again I've
 
07:07:26.628 --> 07:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
heard from several towns that have done
 
07:07:29.468 --> 07:07:29.478 align:start position:0%
this process the emergency authorization
 
07:07:32.388 --> 07:07:32.398 align:start position:0%
and felt it was actually you know
 
07:07:36.628 --> 07:07:36.638 align:start position:0%
Fair easy and you know helpful because
 
07:07:39.990 --> 07:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
Dees is really the best you know source
 
07:07:44.468 --> 07:07:44.478 align:start position:0%
of um advice and information in these
 
07:07:47.150 --> 07:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
kind of of you know restoring a a
 
07:07:50.350 --> 07:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
streamed so that's who you want to go to
 
07:07:53.310 --> 07:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
um and I and I you know I I wish you
 
07:07:55.750 --> 07:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
know this was easier for everybody and
 
07:07:57.708 --> 07:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
that you could just go you know take a
 
07:07:59.590 --> 07:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
backhoe out well I don't wish that but
 
07:08:01.270 --> 07:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
that you could just take a backo out but
 
07:08:03.190 --> 07:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know I understand that that's you
 
07:08:07.468 --> 07:08:07.478 align:start position:0%
have to do things um quickly and perhaps
 
07:08:10.030 --> 07:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
you know nhac could work more closely
 
07:08:13.788 --> 07:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
with Dees to help educate towns that
 
07:08:16.030 --> 07:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
this process is available and here's how
 
07:08:19.910 --> 07:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
we can expedite this work for you um
 
07:08:21.548 --> 07:08:21.558 align:start position:0%
because it is unfortunate if you you
 
07:08:24.430 --> 07:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
feel as a a land owner your your
 
07:08:25.868 --> 07:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
property is threatened and you feel like
 
07:08:28.948 --> 07:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
you have no options there but but again
 
07:08:31.750 --> 07:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
I think if you get familiar with what is
 
07:08:33.910 --> 07:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
available and and you understand the
 
07:08:36.750 --> 07:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
role that Dees plays in this that you'd
 
07:08:39.708 --> 07:08:39.718 align:start position:0%
be more apt to to choose the emergency
 
07:08:41.548 --> 07:08:41.558 align:start position:0%
authorization and then go through an
 
07:08:44.628 --> 07:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
after the fact permit if necessary so
 
07:08:44.638 --> 07:08:45.670 align:start position:0%
after the fact permit if necessary so
that's

07:08:45.670 --> 07:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
07:08:49.350 --> 07:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
um basically our viewpoint on this I'd
 
07:08:52.030 --> 07:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions
 
07:08:54.990 --> 07:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
um if if there's any from the committee
 
07:08:57.468 --> 07:08:57.478 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for members of
 
07:08:57.478 --> 07:09:00.468 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for members of
the

07:09:00.468 --> 07:09:00.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:03.030 --> 07:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee no thank you very
 
07:09:07.708 --> 07:09:07.718 align:start position:0%
much final uh card I have is mareda
 
07:09:11.270 --> 07:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:13.990 --> 07:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
Conservancy thank you very much uh my
 
07:09:16.548 --> 07:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
name is Meredith Hatfield and I do
 
07:09:18.230 --> 07:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
policy and government relations for The
 
07:09:20.270 --> 07:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
Nature Conservancy in New Hampshire we
 
07:09:21.868 --> 07:09:21.878 align:start position:0%
are part of a global
 
07:09:24.510 --> 07:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
organization um and we've been working
 
07:09:26.510 --> 07:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for over 60 years on a
 
07:09:30.230 --> 07:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
range of environmental issues um this
 
07:09:33.030 --> 07:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
really has been a quite sobering hearing
 
07:09:34.868 --> 07:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
um what we're facing in New Hampshire
 
07:09:38.510 --> 07:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
with um extreme weather and the um
 
07:09:40.510 --> 07:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
increasing frequency really is something
 
07:09:42.590 --> 07:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
that is affecting all of
 
07:09:46.270 --> 07:09:46.280 align:start position:0%
us um we do have concerns with this bill
 
07:09:48.150 --> 07:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
um and I I agree with a lot of what um
 
07:09:50.548 --> 07:09:50.558 align:start position:0%
Miss RoR said so I won't repeat that um
 
07:09:53.750 --> 07:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
but wetlands and temporary and perennial
 
07:09:56.590 --> 07:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
streams um provide many benefits um
 
07:09:59.230 --> 07:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
within our ecosystems and as she pointed
 
07:10:02.670 --> 07:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
out actually can help us um with dealing
 
07:10:04.590 --> 07:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
with with this increased uh
 
07:10:06.468 --> 07:10:06.478 align:start position:0%
precipitation and with
 
07:10:10.150 --> 07:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
flooding one thing that um I wanted to
 
07:10:12.150 --> 07:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
specifically point out that Dees said is
 
07:10:15.830 --> 07:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
that we are behind and we agree and I
 
07:10:18.468 --> 07:10:18.478 align:start position:0%
actually wanted to commend to you a
 
07:10:20.190 --> 07:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that I hope will make its
 
07:10:21.990 --> 07:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
way to your committee
 
07:10:25.350 --> 07:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
which establishes um the state
 
07:10:27.750 --> 07:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
adaptation and resilience Council that
 
07:10:29.708 --> 07:10:29.718 align:start position:0%
would actually give us a chance to pull
 
07:10:33.990 --> 07:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
together agencies um including Dees and
 
07:10:36.830 --> 07:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
hscm to consider some of these issues to
 
07:10:40.030 --> 07:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
look at are we coordinating well our
 
07:10:43.030 --> 07:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
people our land owners Farmers business
 
07:10:45.230 --> 07:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
people municipalities are they aware of
 
07:10:48.830 --> 07:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
these processes um are we aware as a
 
07:10:51.708 --> 07:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
state of what is coming and what our
 
07:10:53.948 --> 07:10:53.958 align:start position:0%
needs are and are are we prepared for
 
07:10:58.388 --> 07:10:58.398 align:start position:0%
that um so I would agree that we should
 
07:11:00.948 --> 07:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
um use the processes that exist and not
 
07:11:03.708 --> 07:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
rush into making changes U before really
 
07:11:06.430 --> 07:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
carefully considering the needs and the
 
07:11:09.150 --> 07:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
uh potential impacts and one last thing
 
07:11:10.830 --> 07:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
I wanted to mention is we are actively
 
07:11:14.190 --> 07:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
working with do um to help them
 
07:11:18.070 --> 07:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
identify new ways of building culverts
 
07:11:20.190 --> 07:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
and finding um additional Federal
 
07:11:23.350 --> 07:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
funding so that we can build um the
 
07:11:24.990 --> 07:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
culverts of the future so that we can
 
07:11:28.948 --> 07:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
try to avoid these situations um as we
 
07:11:32.510 --> 07:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
have to accept all this uh additional
 
07:11:36.708 --> 07:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:41.310 --> 07:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:43.510 --> 07:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
07:11:46.030 --> 07:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
D I don't know I'm a little confused
 
07:11:49.030 --> 07:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about culverts and yet it
 
07:11:51.628 --> 07:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
seems as though when I'm
 
07:11:53.190 --> 07:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
first thought of this bill it seemed
 
07:11:56.070 --> 07:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
like a tree falling into the stream that
 
07:11:58.868 --> 07:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
I could pick up maybe and yeah you're
 
07:12:00.788 --> 07:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
talking about all these other things of
 
07:12:02.788 --> 07:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
bridge of butts butt BS and everything
 
07:12:05.590 --> 07:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't see how those two things come
 
07:12:08.750 --> 07:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
together what I don't understand here so
 
07:12:10.590 --> 07:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
actually there was a a story in the
 
07:12:12.670 --> 07:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
paper um about the last storm that we
 
07:12:17.150 --> 07:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
had um and uh a family in Lowden that is
 
07:12:19.468 --> 07:12:19.478 align:start position:0%
um experiencing extreme flooding on
 
07:12:21.468 --> 07:12:21.478 align:start position:0%
their property and it's resulting from a
 
07:12:23.830 --> 07:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
culvert so I think the one of the
 
07:12:26.030 --> 07:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
challenges that was pointed out earlier
 
07:12:29.468 --> 07:12:29.478 align:start position:0%
is that our public infrastructure is
 
07:12:32.670 --> 07:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes um contributing to some of the
 
07:12:34.628 --> 07:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
things that private land owners are
 
07:12:37.948 --> 07:12:37.958 align:start position:0%
facing um and there's a real need to
 
07:12:41.948 --> 07:12:41.958 align:start position:0%
address that and to not be um rebuilding
 
07:12:43.750 --> 07:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the way we have been
 
07:12:45.310 --> 07:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
doing you know maybe for hundreds of
 
07:12:48.590 --> 07:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
years but really thinking about um what
 
07:12:51.830 --> 07:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
are our future needs um so that's why I
 
07:12:51.840 --> 07:12:55.708 align:start position:0%
are our future needs um so that's why I
raised

07:12:55.708 --> 07:12:55.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:58.670 --> 07:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
