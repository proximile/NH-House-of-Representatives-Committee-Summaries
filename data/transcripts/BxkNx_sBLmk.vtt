there a discussion on the amendment yes
 
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
I would like to share some information
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
that I received last week after meeting
 
00:23:49.149 --> 00:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State um along
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
with representative Hamlet we had
 
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
learned that um HB 154 is on the
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
governor's desk ready to be signed so
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
therefore this um
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
um this bill uh HB
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
1523 has another place um which is a
 
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
little which is much better than the
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
previous location uh since it does deal
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
with the clerk and the uh Ward clerk
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
there is now a pre-election certificate
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
that will be handled through the clerk's
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
office previous to the election and this
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
will allow them which they currently do
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
on Election net uh they they do an
 
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
inventory of how many uh absentee
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
ballots they receive and who gets them
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
and all of that this is just putting it
 
00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
into this form which is then shared back
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
to the moderator and also later to the
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office in the
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
returns form so um it's just a way to
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
keep track of um how the absentee
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
ballots are processed and keeping
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
inventory on them
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
um so it doesn't really add much more
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
work it just has it the form is now
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
there for the clerk and just adding this
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
to that that's all and because currently
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
there is no inventory on absentee
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
ballots okay um further discussion on
 
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.710 align:start position:0%
ballots okay um further discussion on
the

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
amendment yes Ser Hamlet thank you Mr

um yeah so in House Bill 154 the
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
pre-election certificate is already
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
designed and it it uh does not include a
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
count of absentee ballots but the city
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
clerks keep a careful inventory of the
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that they re receive so
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
um I mean you know that they receive and
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
then they they actually log them into
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
election n when they receive an
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
application for an absentee ballot when
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
they send out the absentee ballot to the
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
voter and when they receive the marked
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot back from the voter
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
so I don't see any any reason for adding
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
this language about the inventory of the
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
absente ballots in the pre-election
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
necessary discussion on the amendment
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
yes representative bar thank you Mr
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um although I can understand
 
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
why there may not be a need however um
 
00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
that the work is already there
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we change clerks quite
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
frequently we have an election tomorrow
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
um we've now had in my Town we're on
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
possibly a third clerk in three years
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's so many things that these clerks
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
need to learn in a short period of time
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately uh what I'm seeing is
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
that some things are not being done all
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
the way through and this is just one of
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
those checks and balance for the clerk's
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
office just to say like oh I have this
 
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
form oh yes we need to keep track of
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
this so that way the moderator is aware
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
and if anybody has questions it's easily
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
found on the pre-election checklist um
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
if it's on the election net and there
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
are people that have concerns about
 
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots it's very difficult I
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
tried going on there you need an
 
00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:09.559 align:start position:0%
invitation or a special email to to
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
access that um and I recently
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
experienced my daughter um followed
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
through with an absentee ballot and she
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
was not given an email so she could
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
track her uh absentee ballot wasn't even
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
aware of that process so I think there's
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
certain processes that are there that
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
are not followed through but with a form
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
that allows
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
um clerks to uh complete before
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
elections and process it through to the
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
moderator I think it will be very
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial to make sure that all that
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
information is being tracked
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
properly of Hamlet than you Mr
 
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.389 align:start position:0%
properly of Hamlet than you Mr
chairman

00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
the the uh the new the city and town
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
clerks do get training and the Secretary
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
of State trains them there's also an
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
association of the city and town clerks
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
that according to the Secretary of
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
State's office this Association does a
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
lot of training Dean Healey is the the
 
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
um uh town or city clerk from NASA that
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
comes up here quite a bit and um he's I
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
believe he's the president of that
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
Association they do a lot of work
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
training the city and town clerks so
 
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
I still do believe that adding this
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot information to the to
 
00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
the the the nice you know pre-election
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
certificate is just extra information
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
that doesn't need to be on there and I
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
have one more issue um on the amendment
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
it it says on letter c that the number
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
of spoiled ballots should be listed but
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
the spoiled ballots don't happen
 
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.269 align:start position:0%
the spoiled ballots don't happen
until

00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:05.190 align:start position:0%
until
after

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
um let's see the spoil ballots oh so
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
you're thinking that spoil ballots
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
are are identified by the city or town
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
clerk I'm are you asking me yeah I'm
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
asking you yeah so if someone had made
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
an error uh sometimes they'll they can
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
fill out that uh absentee ballot there
 
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
that's a spoiled ballot and they would
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
get a new one to I see I see okay to
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
make that
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
correction okay so I understand why she
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
has why we have spoil ballots in here
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
but I but I don't think it's necessary
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's a good idea to
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know um CL clut clutter up this
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
pre-election certificate with the extra
 
00:29:48.399 --> 00:29:50.029 align:start position:0%
pre-election certificate with the extra
absentee

00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
ballot uh data all right thank
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
you representative weing yeah if I could
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
just ask a general question where where
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
else is this
 
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.950 align:start position:0%
else is this
information

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
captured uh you can find it on Election
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
net because that's where the clerk
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
processes it but I don't have access to
 
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
election net so I'm not able to get that
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
information ask a follow if you'd like
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair so
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
um if this was on the pre-election
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
certificate then it would be General
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
more transparent to the voters at large
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
is that correct and and then they
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to specifically go onto
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
election net in order
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
to understand this information and the
 
00:30:41.509 --> 00:30:41.519 align:start position:0%
reconciliation of the absentee ballots
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
is that correct that is correct and
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
we're only looking at the totals of
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
these items so it's not like we're
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
looking at individual absentee ballots
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
so it would be transparent to those who
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
are interested in seeing the numbers of
 
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.909 align:start position:0%
are interested in seeing the numbers of
absentee

00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
00:30:56.919 --> 00:30:59.070 align:start position:0%
absentee
ballots

00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
of Hamlet thank you Mr
 
00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:05.310 align:start position:0%
of Hamlet thank you Mr
chair

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
um the we've found out since the
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are tracked on Election
 
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
that it's very secure we know
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
exactly you know how many absentee
 
00:31:18.629 --> 00:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
ballots were sent out and how many came
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
back so and I think
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
there maybe this is a weak argument I
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
think there has to be a level of trust
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere that the city clerk that you
 
00:31:30.629 --> 00:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
know the information is in election net
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
and the public if they can't
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
see election net and they I think they
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
have to trust that this uh election
 
00:31:43.149 --> 00:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
officials have you know there's a
 
00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:45.559 align:start position:0%
there's a very clear and precise
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
inventory of the ab absentee ballots I
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
recognized Is there further question Mr
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
representative board excuse me thank you
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just had a technical question
 
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
about lines 9 11 and 19 where you talk
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
about Ward clerk is that city clerk Ward
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
clerks are very different they only work
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
the day of the election there'd be no
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
pre-election involvement of them in
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
cities so I think the terminology here
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
is confused which is not anybody's fault
 
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
it's confused throughout the RSA I think
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
that's the existing RSA let me just
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
trust but verify that stat it is what is
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
existing and it's actually what is on H
 
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.590 align:start position:0%
existing and it's actually what is on H
154

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
154
 
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
out it's inconsistent in the RSA they
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't understand we would have to revamp
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
that whole section plus some but for for
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
sake of time just probably should well
 
00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:40.519 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against this as a highly
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
unnecessary am we'll uh we'll add that
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
we'll add that to our list of fixing
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
after campaign
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
Finance um so I'm going we're going to
 
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
vote on this today um I have sent this
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
off to the clerk the amendment off to
 
00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
the clerk to get a ruling on gerain this
 
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
um I think it is Germain but it is
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
jumping into a different section of RSA
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
you're going from the moderator's
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
worksheet to the clerk's
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
worksheet I told the clerk I believe
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's Germaine but the last thing I want
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
to do is vote on this thing have it be
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
attached send it to the floor and then
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
have to pull it all off so we are going
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
to vote on this today we're going to go
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
into the AI bill but I'm I'm waiting for
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
a ruling on ger maintenance just so I
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
know so if we're done with the debate
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recess it um when we can I
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
just make sure that I explain it
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
correctly it was under the moderator
 
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
certificate because there was no place
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
for this however because of HB 154 it
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
opened an an Avenue for the clerk to
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
have a pre-election certificate so
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
that's where I believe the best place is
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
for it because the clerk is the one that
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
um manages the the absentee ballots okay
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
that's we'll uh we'll we'll take it back
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
when we come back we are going to come
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
back to this today we're going to come
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
back in a deposition on the amendment um
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
Z bur yes okay um so with that I'm going
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
to recess 1523 we'll come back on a
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
disposition on the amendment I'm going
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
to open up the um I'm going to open up
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1596 FN requiring a
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure of deceptive artificial
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
intelligence usage and political
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
advertising um representative weary is
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
motion I'd like to make a motion of in
 
00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:27.079 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate a second I second
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
that represent put Brian second would
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion yes um so
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh Judiciary is right now working on a
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
framework for artificial intelligence
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
and I think um part of that includes the
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
election um aspects and I think um it we
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
would be better served if we waited a
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
little bit I first of all I'm I'm
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
completely behind the principles of this
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a good idea I think
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's much needed um so I'm not
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
um castigating the the bill in principle
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
what I'm objecting to is is that I think
 
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
we've got another committee that is
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
spearheading artificial intelligence and
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
we should let them do their work and
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
then um as necessary
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
modify our legislation after they're
 
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
done their preliminary
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
work I'm sure representative Brennan
 
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to that thank you Mr
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
chair um the regarding the statement
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
about the bill that is in judiciary
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
there are actually several AI bills um
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is stripping the election part
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
out of the bill that they have before
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
them and in fact all of the AI sponsor
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
Bill sponsors have been invited to a
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
meeting this afternoon to discuss um
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
making some cohesiveness between all of
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
them um but the this bill would be the
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle strictly for elections whereas
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
the other bill
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
um stand on their own this bill as
 
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
written is able to go into effect prior
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
to the 2024 election all other bills
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
being considered by Judiciary and other
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
committees may not go into effect
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
actually cannot go into effect until
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
2025 I think it's really important that
 
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
we pass this legislation so that we can
 
00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
have something in place prior to the
 
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
2024 elections um this is the only Bill
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
that is allowed to be passed um um and
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
go into effect prior to November 2024
 
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
the rest cannot because of the way that
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
they are written and they have criminal
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
and civil penalties um explicitly
 
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
spelled out and prescribed within those
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
bills this bill does not it leaves it to
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
the courts to decide what is the
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate penalty um while that may
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
not be the ideal um Bill this is the one
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
that provides the framework and allows
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
for for future bills to go into effect
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
in 2025 to be more prescriptive in how
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
they handle um AI related deep fakes um
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
and deceptive media
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
manipulation so I would ask that at
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
minimum um we consider passing this bill
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
ought to pass um and if there is an
 
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
appetite for waiting until after um
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
there has been discussion after today's
 
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.030 align:start position:0%
there has been discussion after today's
meeting

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
um to try and make the cohesion between
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
the bills um then I would ask that you
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
potentially recess so that we can come
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
back to it and potentially have um
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
language that works throughout all the
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
bills but again this is the only Bill
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
that can be passed and go into effect
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
prior to the 2024
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
elections further discussion on the
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
motion of next me to
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
legislate pres Lane
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I'd also just like to
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that Secretary of
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
State scalan actually supported this
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill and said it was a great first step
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
um and then we can build on it in the
 
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
next uh years to come as we get more
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
information and we're not quite so
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
rushed and I also would ask that we
 
00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
recess and get Advantage take advantage
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
of the meeting that's going to happen at
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
12:30 and then either come back to this
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
today if we have to or take it up next
 
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.230 align:start position:0%
today if we have to or take it up next
Tuesday

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion V speak
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
to legislate representative katam I just
 
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that the same
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
section is also getting changed in the
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
Judiciary bill so these would be like
 
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
conflicting with each other um and that
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
one although they're still trying to
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
work on it today at 12:30 I think the
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
definitions are much more cleaned up in
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
it and it's
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
just the the legal terms in it are just
 
00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
much much more clear I do understand
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
your concern about the the effective
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
date and perhaps that's something that
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
could be changed in that one but I just
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
I I am a little bit concerned that if
 
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
even if this passed today and then the
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
other one passes next week then it's
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
anyway represent Bron thank you um the
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
way that this bill is written again is
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
the it's the only way to pass something
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
in time for the 2024 election while I do
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
agree that the the definitions in the
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
other bills could be incorporated into
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and that is why I ask for a
 
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
you to consider a recess so that we can
 
00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
get an amendment there were a lot of
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
developments that happened in the last
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
couple of days um in communication with
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
the other sponsors and the uh
 
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
development of this meeting happening
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
today um that made it impossible to get
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
an amendment drafted to make the
 
00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
definitions match
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
as far as the other bills superseding
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would still be in effect prior
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
to the other ones taking effect so while
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
this bill may not um last in its current
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
form forever it is the only way to get
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
something done this is a bill that is um
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
widely supported and it is supported
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
emphatically by the Secretary of State
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
for passing it in this form um so again
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
again we can have it in place before the
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
2024 elections the other bills
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely cannot there is a rule that
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
they cannot go into effect until 2025
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
because of this prescriptive nature um
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
and the criminal penalties
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
Associated um with those bills so this
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
is the only way forward um and you know
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
again I would ask if you would consider
 
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
a recess that might be the ideal way um
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all bills are properly
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
considered if you would not like to
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
consider recess then I would ask that
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
you consider passing this bill ought to
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
pass and perhaps there might be a floor
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
amendment that could deal with um some
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
of the definitions that might come out
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
of the meeting later
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
today first question representative
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
qua Mr chairman uh I too have some
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
concerns with this
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
bill and they focus around uh lines 15-
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
18 on page one
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
and then lines 11 and 12 on page two
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
on page one line 15 uh if you read
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
through to 18 it appears to say that a
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
person shall not uh distribute one of
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
these deep
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
fakes uh who should have known it's
 
00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:52.839 align:start position:0%
deceptive and
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
fraudulent and then on page two lines 11
 
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
uh lines 11 and 12 it talks about how a
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
candidate can bring an action for
 
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
general or special damages against the
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh it sounds to me as if this
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
would leave a person who simply
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
innocently distributed a message they
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
forward an email or share a Facebook
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
post they came
 
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.670 align:start position:0%
post they came
across

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
across
 
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
uh would then be subject to potential
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
Court action
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
for damages would then have to prove
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
they it wasn't the case they should have
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
known and I think the heart of the
 
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
problem here is that these deep fakes
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
are very difficult for anybody without
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh significant technical knowledge and
 
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
possibly proper software to determine
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
that it's a deep fake so in a nutshell
 
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned it could expose Ordinary
 
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
People to the risk of a court action
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
which they would then have to hire legal
 
00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:57.559 align:start position:0%
help to defend against and and I think
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
that could have a chilling effect on
 
00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:00.559 align:start position:0%
their exercise of their first amendment
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
rights I I have other concerns about the
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
bill but that's my chief concern If This
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
Were change to uh someone uh shall not
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
create and
 
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
distribute uh such a synthetic uh deep
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
fake file I think that would address my
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
main concern thank
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
you represent BR thank you um there is a
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
difference between a sponsor distributor
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
and an average average person forwarding
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
an email um and so you know it's
 
00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
important to make that distinction we
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
have heard um
 
00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.230 align:start position:0%
have heard um
from

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh media companies who are concerned
 
00:43:40.549 --> 00:43:40.559 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:42.309 align:start position:0%
about the
distribution

00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
um mentioned in this bill and they have
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
submitted language for an amendment but
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
there have been other things that have
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
come across that have come um before me
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of days that would be
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
suggested language that we could address
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
if this bill is recess or again if uh it
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be passed today for a floor
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm more than happy to hear
 
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
your um suggested language
 
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
representative qua and would welcome
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
that I've gotten several emails from
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
several different people several
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
suggested amendments and it just could
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
not happen fast enough to for today as
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
that much of that has been received in
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
the last couple of days and as we know
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
um OS doesn't work on the weekends which
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
is good for them thank
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
you further discussion on the motion of
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
any speed to
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
legislate hearing none I'm going to
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
recess this
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
bill um was trying to let you guys duke
 
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
it out while I got my Germaine ruling um
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%

00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:54.559 align:start position:0%
come back to it today just FYI um so
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
you'll if you're leaving um
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
then you're not going to be enjoying the
 
00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
public hearings in the afternoon um
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
you'll have to take me on my word when I
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
say that if we reconvene the executive
 
00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
session this will be the only Bill that
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
we will take up um okay so we're
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
recessed on
 
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
15 996 um the executive session will
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
stand in
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
recess um because we're still waiting on
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
the gerus ruling so we'll start up on
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
the work
 
00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.630 align:start position:0%
the work
session

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
gears all right so G to open up the full
 
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
committee work session on House Bill
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
1091 relative to financing of political
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
campaigns um I believe representative
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
Lane has a redlined copy of the
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to the amendment to the
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to the r
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
clutched

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:55.829 align:start position:0%
 
think

00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.839 --> 00:47:25.829 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:55.829 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.839 --> 00:48:15.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
at the request of a couple of people and
 
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:20.200 align:start position:0%
at the request of a couple people I went
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
through I don't need this somebody else
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
can have it um just to show every body
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
because the way that OS put this
 
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
together was to change the entire
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
chapter and there's a lot of sections
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
that are not changing so what I did was
 
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
go through and X out for you all the
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
sections that are not changing so that
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
you could focus on the ones that are
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
changing and when I get done with this
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
it eliminates about three pages out of
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
the bill yeah so there yeah so there's a
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
lot of things that in here that simply
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
when OS put it together they just
 
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
included everything including things
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
that weren't changing
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
so I thought at least that would allow
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
us to focus on the things that are
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
changing and you could look at those and
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
then a lot of the ones at the
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
end do show what's changed in the bill
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
so the last few pages of here highlight
 
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
in bold what's changing the language
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's changing and and take out what's
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
what is what is being deleted and a lot
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
of those are just to go through and to
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
um if you might recall rep
 
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
representative Qua we agreed that we
 
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
would put in keep in uh succeed success
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
what is it succeed or defeat or success
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
or defeat or whatever that term
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
was to replace yeah to replace the term
 
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
influence to support blah oppose
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
whatever so a lot of that when you go
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
back and change that that means a lot
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
that nothing's changing in a lot of
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
these sections the other one that's
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
being changed a lot is when you get into
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
some of the communication stuff it
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
focuses only on calling so we put it in
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
as communication again that's the only
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
thing that's changing is the word
 
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
calling is becoming communication that's
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
in push pulling and then when we get to
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
a section about um there one of the
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
comments that they asked us to change
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
was make it Treasurer throughout so it's
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
just treasure and Fiscal Agent so any
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
time the word Fiscal Agent showed up we
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
had to change it to Treasurer so that's
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
again a lot of these changes they're in
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
they're in here and they're minor but
 
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:53.799 align:start position:0%
it's not really the Crux of what we were
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
trying to do so I I would just beg your
 
00:50:59.710 --> 00:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
Indulgence that's the way when you go
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
through a complicated section like this
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
that you have to do it but I'm hoping at
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
least you can see that the things that
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
are CH what's important and what's
 
00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:09.799 align:start position:0%
changing and that was the purpose of
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
this I did give to OS today uh changes
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
based on what we talked about last week
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
because we're running out of time but
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have that in front
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
of us for
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
today um and the other paining I held I
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
gave you are definitions that we worked
 
00:51:32.349 --> 00:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
on last week that I cleaned up and
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um I wasn't I was getting
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
tired so it's not redlined but but but
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
it's pretty it's pretty much reflecting
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
what we talked about last week and one
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the things that we've talked
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
about and we probably should talk about
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
today is one of the things we did is we
 
00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
conflated one of the comments we got was
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
that there is no definition of an
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
exploratory time a primary time and a
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
general time so and you can give but but
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
the statute says you can give like 5,000
 
00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
during this time 5,000 during that time
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
and 5 thou but there's no definitions of
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
when those times start and end so what
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
the committee did was just collapse it
 
00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
and make it one
 
00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
time and so it didn't change the amounts
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
so you can give it to total of
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
15,000 during the election time and then
 
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
we defined election cycle but that's why
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
we had to also Define candidate because
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't sure when you became another
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
thing was nobody's sure when you became
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
candidate because it says well you file
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
for office and the problem is you're
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
fundraising and Gathering money as we
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
all know during our current campaign for
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
governor everybody's out raising money
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
now but nobody's having to report it
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
because they have it technically filed
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
so the idea being that we would get you
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
can raise all the money you want you can
 
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
get it from wherever you want just be
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
transparent about it and so file it and
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
be transparent about it and that's
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
really what I think the bulk of what we
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
worked on was to try and go through that
 
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
piece and I know representative quy I
 
00:53:20.589 --> 00:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
think you may not be no that was Senator
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
gray Senator gray is not in favor of
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
conflating it so we'll take that up in
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
the Senate when we get over there but I
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
guess I just want to have everybody talk
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
about that and give us your feelings on
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
that because that's what the
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee came up with but if the
 
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
committee is not comfortable with that
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
idea then we need to talk about
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
ration um no I have not heard why I
 
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
don't recall one either this was by
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
email I think that we got that and to uh
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
agree with with representative Lane well
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
my idea of
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
having one period that covers the whole
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
election cycle but with the same total
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
donation is that I think it's reasonable
 
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:10.799 align:start position:0%
to presume that candidates and political
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
committees are competent to manage their
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
finances over that
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
period uh and and as far as
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
uh well the rationale for requiring
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh candidates and political committees
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
to report receipts above a certain
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
threshold uh I think the Secretary of
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
State expressed it very well he said the
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
point is to uh enable the public to to
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
decide for themselves whether someone
 
00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
might be subject to undo influence by
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
say a major
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
donor uh and the the rationale for
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
having uh these entities report their
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
expenses is in my view is that it
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
ensures the public that those donations
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
are being spent for the political
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
campaign purpose but there's no you know
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
right just makes it more it keeps it
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
transparent that's what we do now and it
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
keeps it
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
transparent and I I consider that uh a
 
00:55:15.839 --> 00:55:17.109 align:start position:0%
transparent and I I consider that uh a
sufficient

00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
reason the transparency in that with the
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
receipts and
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
expenses uh I consider
 
00:55:25.319 --> 00:55:27.309 align:start position:0%
expenses uh I consider
that

00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
making sure the public can decide for
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
themselves if undo undue influence is
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
involved is a sufficient reason for that
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
compromise to what I think should be in
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
Violet that is the First Amendment right
 
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
to free
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
speech thank
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
you yeah and and so where that shows up
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's not specifically stated anywhere
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
but it shows up on page eight on line
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
four where it it talks about it
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
basically those three categories of time
 
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
have been deleted in that
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
section so it it it you have to kind of
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
know what you're looking for
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
that um you have to kind of know what
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
the intent was in order to understand
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
that change which is why I wanted to
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
bring it up to everybody so because I
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
don't know that looking through it you'd
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
capture that necessarily as to why why
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
done and then another big change is
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
later down on that same page is about
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
Surplus campaign
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
contributions and this was something
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
that the Secretary of State asked so and
 
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
we talked about because a lot of people
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
don't um bring their accounts down to
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
zero as we those of us a lot of us got
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
letters I got a letter about you know
 
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
and if you don't do it there's severe
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
penalties and we um need to address that
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
so the way the Secretary of State
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
suggested doing it was to whatever is
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
left in your account at the end of your
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
campaign gets rolled over into a new um
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
campaign account so basically it saves
 
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
us all from being in violation of the
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance laws
 
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
unintentionally and um it will roll over
 
00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:20.039 align:start position:0%
for the next year into a new account you
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
would have to bring that still down to
 
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
zero but in in the in the future but if
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
you're running again you're not going to
 
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
bring it you just have to file um so
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
that would keep a lot of us from being
 
00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
in violation of the unwittingly being in
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
violation of the campaign Finance laws
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
repres to the next
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
campaign um so that balance becomes the
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
new balance
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
for your next campaign and if you're not
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to run then you you have to get
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
your that down to zero anyway so often
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
what people will do if it's been a loan
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
to themselves they'll pay that loan back
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
or that you can give it to another
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
campaign so a lot of people give it
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
to you know to the party to another
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
campaign you know whatever so and but
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
you would have to get it down to
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
zero also give it to a
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
charity yes
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
you need to get it down to zero if you
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
want to close that correct that account
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
out if you want to end it you have to
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
get it down to Zero by one of the
 
00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.309 align:start position:0%
get it down to Zero by one of the
approved

00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
methods the the excess funds from Barry
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
for governor will be given to charity
 
00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:47.039 align:start position:0%
not to the not to the party just
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
saying okay and and then one of the the
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
other things that Secretary of State and
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
the AG's office asked us to do was to
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
synchron the reporting dates between all
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
different kinds of political committees
 
00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
so we have done
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
that um bear with me it's on P page nine
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
and it starts um down at the bottom of
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
that page um where it talks about the
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
first Wednesday so this section is is
 
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
relatively new the wording it's some of
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
it's the same but some of it's new but
 
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
the goal here is so that all political
 
00:59:27.309 --> 00:59:27.319 align:start position:0%
committees have the same reporting
 
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
schedules and there it doesn't vary by
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
different um types of political
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
committees and then one of the
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
definitions on this little p this page I
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
gave you was political committee um and
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
it reflects the changes that I think we
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
talked about but I would ask everybody
 
00:59:52.029 --> 00:59:52.039 align:start position:0%
to maybe look at that as well
 
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
because it's much more simplified than
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
what's in the existing
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
statute and what happens is that if once
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
a political
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee um spends $1,000 or gathers
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
receipts of
 
01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:13.039 align:start position:0%
$1,000 then they have to report so the
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
threshold is
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
$1,000 again you can take as much in you
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
can spend as much as you want assuming
 
01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
the statute lets
 
01:00:24.029 --> 01:00:24.039 align:start position:0%
you because some of these are are are
 
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
limited but just disclose it it's all
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
we're after is just disclose
 
01:00:33.309 --> 01:00:33.319 align:start position:0%
it um and and to do it in a uniform
 
01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:35.799 align:start position:0%
manner because they they entertain a lot
 
01:00:39.029 --> 01:00:39.039 align:start position:0%
of questions SOS and the H's office
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
about when do I file how do I file that
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
kind of thing so um I
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
it and then the other thing about
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
reporting um is that we're going to
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
report by everybody has to report the
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
way it's written everybody has to report
 
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
using the um campaign
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
Finance program or system on the
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office the
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
portal sometimes I don't like to use
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
that word because people I appreciate
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
that not using the term thank you people
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
get have a knee-jerk reaction sometimes
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
to the word I I'm one of those people
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
and um we we phased it in with the idea
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
being one the secretary of state
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
is um developing a new
 
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
system and then two to have everybody
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
start using it the first year would
 
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
probably be a disaster so we phased it
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
in by having those um who have staff
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
basically and have the smaller numbers
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
so Governor State Senate executive um
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
coun members right those are the three
 
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
and then we would bring uh us the house
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
reps and the commi the Commissioners in
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
and anybody else in later in the second
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
year and um so that was because the I
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that a lot of people
 
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
in larger races do not use it and it's
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
very confusing and very hard to get the
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
data if it's not in the system in other
 
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
words if they they actually fact it in
 
01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
they're still faxing their stuff in so
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
and they don't follow things by putting
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
them in alphabetical order and they make
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
it really hard for people to get the
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
data so the idea in the committee was to
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
try and do it this way and phase it
 
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
in so which I'm a huge I'm a huge fan of
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
that idea um because there are a lot of
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
games that are played with that um so to
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
representative Lane's Point you'll get a
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
candidate for for governor will fax in
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
like a 50 60 page report which is then
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
barely legible because it came in via
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
fax in
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
2024 um and then the Secretary of
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
State's office has to get it scan it and
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
then upload it and that takes a little
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
while so while everybody else has
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
reported and have their stuff posted the
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
campaigns that have decided to still use
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
paper in
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
2024 um are have having
 
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
their disclosures obstated for an extra
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
48 Hours um which is a problem because
 
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
we have a 48 hour reporting requirement
 
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.069 align:start position:0%
we have a 48 hour reporting requirement
um

01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
so that that's I know there's going to
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
be I know that when some of our
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the house see that there's
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
going to be this knee-jerk reaction the
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
online system is really easy to use it
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
is really easy it is easier than paper
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
like it just it just is so it's
 
01:03:57.069 --> 01:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
2024 we can report these things online
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
the other nice part about it is it
 
01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
becomes night and day did you have your
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
reported on time there's no like I used
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
to play a game I'd email it in at 1159
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
because the law says that day so I'd
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
schedule it up it would hit at 1159 um
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
so you can't play those games when
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
you're using online because it's just
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
did you make it yes or no um and it's
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
much I don't even I don't like fair but
 
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
it's much more um transparent and it
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't I don't think it imp on anyone's
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
First Amendment right to send a fact
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
like I'm sorry just not a thing so I'm
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
very happy that's in there I have some
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman are we following normal
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
rules of procedure where I need to be
 
01:04:38.589 --> 01:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
recognized first if it gets out of
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
control yes but it hasn't so no so more
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
like the rules we had on the
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay I do have some
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
reservations about making the use of the
 
01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
automated online system mandatory for
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
everyone I have two concerns one I do
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
think it will it will encounter more
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
opposition in the house and we need to
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
get it past the house and I'm
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
also uh somewhat concerned that it could
 
01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
be an additional barrier to
 
01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.549 align:start position:0%
be an additional barrier to
participation

01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
participation
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
for candidates for for the house in
 
01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:14.119 align:start position:0%
particular who are running very lowcost
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
campaigns I think this could be fixed by
 
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
I'm putting this thought out here I
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
think this could be fixed by putting a
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
dollar threshold on
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
expenses expenditures and receipts for
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
when you have to use the online system
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's just that's my thought I mean we
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
could keep it the same as is now as
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
$1,000 thousand like you know so I I I
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
think that would be moot because if it's
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
$1,000 doll to follow to begin with I
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
would make it a bit higher than that you
 
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
think I I guess I can't believe I'm to
 
01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
say this I I I thought $1,000 for a
 
01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:47.079 align:start position:0%
state prep was not a lowcost campaign
 
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
some State prep put a lot less than that
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I I know I'm not an expert in
 
01:05:56.109 --> 01:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
this but I um I run a lowcost campaign
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh and I strive to keep my campaign
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
expenses under $500 if at all possible
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
and uh I think that and when at the
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
point there was one point where I think
 
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
the threshold was lower and I used the
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's system which was at
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
that point not it was not an ideal
 
01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
system but it was certainly not terribly
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
problematic and it was a lot easier than
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
like messing with envelopes or faxes or
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
anything it was it was just like you put
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
it into the Right Slots on the on the
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
web page and you're done yeah my
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
favorite part about it is it keeps your
 
01:06:35.549 --> 01:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
donor L populated so if like somebody
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
gives you another contribution you can
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
just click on it and it just
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
automatically populates that all that is
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
that is I cannot tell you how convenient
 
01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
that is not having to go and look up the
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
same person 19 times I I like the system
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
myself I found it pretty straightforward
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
yeah well that's why I think it's
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
important we do phase it in um I hear
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
the concern um but I
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
think I mean I I I I guess an easy
 
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
counter punch is is how many of our
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
members are actually having how many how
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
many members do we have that are getting
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
the physical calendar mailed to them
 
01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
because they don't use the internet and
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
are also running campaigns over
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
$1,000 I would imagine that number would
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
be zero um I do know that there are a
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
couple of members that get the calendar
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
mailed to them like that's the thing
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
like you have that option as a State Rep
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
you can get the calendar mailed to you
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
if you choose to um well I I did get it
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
mailed to me because I don't want to
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
print out 75 pages on my printer but the
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
difficulty with that is it takes six
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
days to get to me so I'll probably get
 
01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
this week's on Thursday you'll enjoy
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
you'll enjoy enjoy finding out what
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
enjoy finding out what you just voted on
 
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
out representative B yeah it must be
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah don't care yeah I agree I mean I
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
don't mail anything I mean I don't I
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
tell my dentist I don't buy stamps so
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
you have to wait to my next appointment
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
to get my money but the point is it's
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
the same online is easy it's it's what
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
but the thing is and I don't spend any
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
money on my campaigns I mean other than
 
01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:11.799 align:start position:0%
when I ran for Senate but I had a file
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
but I mean I bought my signs years ago
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
and I haven't spent any money for
 
01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
forever type thing so and I don't take
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
money from people and I don't spend
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
money so you know the county spends
 
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
money for me but that's their
 
01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.470 align:start position:0%
money for me but that's their
problem

01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
so I have the other situation where I
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
think I'm one of the like highest
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
spending State reps think I'm like yeah
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
but that's what happens when you
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
represent Manchester
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm the proud representative of the
 
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
chairman of the democratic party and I'm
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
sure he's I'm sure he loves my voting
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
and and you have a floal and I have I
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
have a 30,000 float I have a huge seat I
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
a huge competitive I have a huge seat I
 
01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
think it's the 15th most competitive
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
seat in the state um and I'm a I'm a
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
Target but representative
 
01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
Lane um to to look at representative
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
qu's um concerns one thing that I
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
remember seeing when I was reading some
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
different statutes where they were
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
transitioning into this is that if you
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
needed assistance or you didn't want to
 
01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
do this that you could get a waiver from
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office and it
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
also required them and and I don't know
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
if any of you but I've they're wonderful
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
to help you because I had so I don't
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
know if we put something like that in to
 
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
help the folks that you know for like
 
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the first three or four years to
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
kind of transition in if that would um
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
appease that and make it more yeah I
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
think that sounds yeah just just
 
01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
some some way that people are going to
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
have a real difficulty with it but
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
aren't spending you know huge amounts I
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
mean you you and I discussed this uh and
 
01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
I think we agreed that it's the the big
 
01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
money races that are the most concerned
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
and they would they are I think and
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
should be of the most concern to the
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
public yeah I think starting off with
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
Senate council governor and Pax is the
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
way to go and then and and a a waiver
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
would be would be simple too and yeah
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
not complicate things it would be nice
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
like you have to explain why you want to
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
waiver like I cannot use have the
 
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
Internet it's like okay do you want
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
people knowing that
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
like but I think that's a reasonable way
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
to deal with that concern okay I think
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's fine I if that if that keeps you
 
01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
said I would like to eventually move to
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
a system where it's you have to report
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
it online because it's just it's just
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
getting out of it's it's I mean it's
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
rampantly abused it's just rampantly
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
abused and it's not it's not driving any
 
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
compelling interest to keep it like that
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
so all right we want to continue on
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
representative Lane as we wait for our
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh apparently we're about to get a
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
ruling any minute now on the geras any
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
minute I know you are waiting with
 
01:11:01.679 --> 01:11:03.550 align:start position:0%
minute I know you are waiting with
baited

01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
baited
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
breath one other thing that we defined
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
was election cycle and we went um around
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
and around about the exact dates but
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
right now you'll see that it starts um
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
an election cycle starts the day after
 
01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.669 align:start position:0%
an election cycle starts the day after
the

01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
election it's in a I'm sorry it's a
 
01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.350 align:start position:0%
election it's in a I'm sorry it's a
definition

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I changed it or not hold
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
the it's on page six it's line
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
three and what we we kind of tossed
 
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
around a lot of different ideas but now
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
we've come to that it begins I'm sorry
 
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's on the eighth day after a state
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
election through seven days after the
 
01:12:00.189 --> 01:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
next state general election so the idea
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
was to capture that whole time period
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
and um the de the debate about when
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
exactly it starts and stops was that you
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
might want some time to kind of clean up
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
that and people might give you money
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
that you that you haven't put in yet and
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
whatever and to cut it off pretty soon
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
and um and then at that point then
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
you're running for your next
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
whatever election it is so I just
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
thought people should see that because
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
that is a at least I thought was a big
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
change we but we need to Define what
 
01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
election cycle is so that we know how
 
01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
when the time period is that people can
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
give money to because we don't really
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
defined so I don't know if people have
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that I know um
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
representative Barry um wanted some I
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
think you wanted an additional time or
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I'm not I'm not I'm not
 
01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
gonna die on the hill but yeah know it's
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
I I I think I wanted it after the re I
 
01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
think I basically wanted certification
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
um after the recounts and everything but
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
I think this is I
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
I'm it's not going to be like you must
 
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
do this or I will not vote for it's not
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
that sort of deal um but that that was
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
that was in my mind like once the
 
01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
elections certified and over then it's
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
over because you still have recounts and
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
stuff like that and um but I said it's
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
not that's just an idea it's not a it's
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
not a line of the
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
sand well I guess in that sense will you
 
01:13:38.229 --> 01:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
be you will be expending money at that
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
point so and it would be for that
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
election yeah that was my thought
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
process on it was that the recounts can
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
take up to two weeks
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
um you know and if you're in theory
 
01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
hiring an attorney that sort of stuff um
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
right that would be so you want to say a
 
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
eight days after the election is
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
certified you you could do to me the day
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
the election certified it's fine
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
whatever you want it's fine I said I'm
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
not well I think this was the
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation of Secretary State and
 
01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
then we talked about it in the committee
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure everybody's
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
got a consensus so that you know it
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't come up in yeah if you want to
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
do eight days after certification I
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
think that's that seems
 
01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.590 align:start position:0%
think that's that seems
reasonable

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
um yes represent rapor um yeah just a
 
01:14:25.149 --> 01:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
question would that mean that different
 
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
Races end on different times if if a
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
race is certified yeah that's a good
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
point two days
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
after mean so would it be better to say
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
three weeks after the election because
 
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
we know that everything will be
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
that that's fine that's a good
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
point yeah let's just do three weeks
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
call it a day I think that I think
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's fine too the important point is
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
to have it clearly defined yeah yeah
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
have have a yeah that that's I'm more
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm more concerned about that point than
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
I am anything else is the actual I said
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
this point in the
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
committee right there needs to be an end
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
there has to be at some point it has to
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
come to a
 
01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.070 align:start position:0%
come to a
stop

01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
stop
 
01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.350 align:start position:0%
stop
um

01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
um okay uh speaker says it is fine so
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna get out of
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%

when we met with the secretary of state
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
office they made it clear that the um
 
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
the count Counting of the regular
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
election day ballots is completely
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
different from the handling of the
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots it's a completely
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
different process the absentee ballots
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
are sent out to the city clerks before
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
the regular ballots
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
and then the city clerks you know track
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
you know they track how many
 
01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
applications you you know like I
 
01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:58.890 align:start position:0%
applications you you know like I
explained

01:18:58.890 --> 01:18:58.900 align:start position:0%
explained
 
01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.430 align:start position:0%
explained

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.070 align:start position:0%

um

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:07.229 --> 01:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
and in fact the city clerk could could
 
01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
mail out I
 
01:19:12.629 --> 01:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
don't this could get really confusing
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
but I believe the city clerk could if
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
they mailed an absentee ballot to a
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
voter and the voter called up and said
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
they lost it the clerk had send out a
 
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
second absentee ballot
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
to that voter but it would be not noted
 
01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
in election net that two ballots were
 
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
sent out to that voter so that if that
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
voter tries to vote twice twice that
 
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
will immediately be caught by the city
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
clerk when when the ballots are received
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
back so the absentee ballot inventory is
 
01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.070 align:start position:0%
back so the absentee ballot inventory is
just

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't know it's a little bit non-
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
gerain to to what I was
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
what is it 154 it's trying to do which
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
was to uh you know clean up the the
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
pre-election certificate and the
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
moderators postelection certificate
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
which they are nicely cleaned up right
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
now and it also addressed the um New
 
01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.149 align:start position:0%
now and it also addressed the um New

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
so I understand what what the sponsor is
 
01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
is trying to do with you know helping to
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
assure all the all the voter all the
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
people that are questioning you know the
 
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
uh validity of the um inventory of the
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
ballots you know I understand that she's
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do that but I don't think it's
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
necessary on this
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
all yes representative Burnham thank you
 
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
chairman yes so
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
this this is a new form established by
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
HB 154 and if it's signed in then only
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
then can this amendment take effect
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
there is no other form or access except
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
for online through election n by the
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
clerk to um see the inventory of
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots um so I just uh I think
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
that it just allows more transparency
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
for our voters uh to
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
see how many absentee ballots are
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
received how many are released to those
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
requesting them how many actually come
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
back because some voters may not send
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
them back um how many might be spoiled
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
it might be a small number but as we
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
continue to use more and more absentee
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
ballots I think it would be very
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
important to have this ahead of time so
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
if there's any question by voters um
 
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a quick view on one sheet
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's all together given to uh the
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
moderator and the Secretary of State's
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
Hamlet um so I think if we pass this
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
amendment I think we're actually
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
amending House Bill 154 no okay so I've
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
let this go 154 is signed into law so it
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
is now law right so we're not attaching
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
to 154 it is now chaptered RSA
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's a thing so this certificate exists
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
it is a thing now um so it's not if it's
 
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
signed into law it's law yes so it's not
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
it's not an attachment to 154 the RSA
 
01:22:41.709 --> 01:22:41.719 align:start position:0%
now exists this is a are we going to
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
change the RSA that was in 154 that
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
became law are we going to now attach
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.350 align:start position:0%
 
certificate

01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay do that clarify everything for
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
everybody 154 is law I tried not to talk
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
about 154 but 154 is law the universally
 
01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.189 align:start position:0%
about 154 but 154 is law the universally
loved

01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
loved
 
01:23:04.199 --> 01:23:06.030 align:start position:0%
loved
154

01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
154
 
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
um any other discussion on the
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
amendment um I will end with this I'll
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%

um the committee I have voted for many
 
01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:19.639 align:start position:0%
amendments that I disagree with in the
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
interest of moving things forward for
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
the other side so I would appreciate
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
some difference on that even if you you
 
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
do not even if you have fundamental
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
disagreements with the underlying bill
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
or even the bill as amended um but
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's all I can say to that with that
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%

01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
law when it would be completed in the
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
election process representative Burnham
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
you want to answer
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
that is in other words is this before um
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
the polls
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
open oh yes uh this so the the
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
pre-election certificate is completed
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
before the election by the um clerk
 
01:26:23.239 --> 01:26:26.990 align:start position:0%
before the election by the um clerk
yes

01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
there yes sorry representative
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
Mirad that question um the original 154
 
01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
now law it says when the ballots are
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
counted the moderator and Kirk shall um
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
certify the number received and here it
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
says when the ballots and absentee
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
ballots are counted now does that mean
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
when the unmarked ballots are counted
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
prior to voting day or does that mean
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
when the marked ballots are counted
 
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
done it means unmarked means the
 
01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet's answering
 
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.270 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet's answering
ballots

01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
that sent by the Secretary of State to
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
the city and town clerks those uncounted
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
those are the uncounted
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
ballots uncounted okay and represent
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
head recognized and and what what point
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
like in the existing pre-election
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
certificate when would it says when the
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
ballots are counted the moderator and
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
clerk shall certify thereon the total
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
number of ballots received when would
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
that certification happen as 154 is
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
currently written and
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
legislated let's look oh it can happen
 
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the
 
01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:49.870 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the
election

01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
unless unless absentee ballots are
 
01:27:54.189 --> 01:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
included if absentee ballots are
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
included we we still receive some
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots during election day so
 
01:28:09.310 --> 01:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
on yeah believe that's correct and I
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
have I have another comment after him oh
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
represent sorry I'm I'm trying to trying
 
01:28:19.149 --> 01:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
to read yes represent M okay thank you
 
01:28:21.070 --> 01:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
um if we had to wait until all the
 
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
voting was done to make sure that no
 
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
election absentee B received on voting
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
day this would no longer be a
 
01:28:26.639 --> 01:28:28.750 align:start position:0%
day this would no longer be a
pre-election

01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
pre-election
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
certificate representative Burnham
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
actually um that those numbers are
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
counted on the moderator's worksheet and
 
01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
that was already pre-existing this is
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
just counting the B the absentee ballets
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
that are sent to the clerk's office um
 
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
that are requested by voters okay that
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
closes the Friday prior to elections the
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
number of absentee ballots spoiled that
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
would be the ones if the voter uh makes
 
01:28:59.310 --> 01:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
an error on their ballot and goes back
 
01:29:01.149 --> 01:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
for a second ballot that would be a
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
spoil ballot prior to election the
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
number of absentee ballots not returned
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
by voters that would be even taken that
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
would be by that Friday or
 
01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
um the uh prior to the election so th
 
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
those numbers would be there um and then
 
01:29:22.109 --> 01:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
the number of absentee ballots not used
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
and that would be that Friday prior to
 
01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
and that would be that Friday prior to
elction

01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
elction
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
ction okay so I'm going to read RSA
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
65832 from s SP 154 so we're all on the
 
01:29:32.639 --> 01:29:33.510 align:start position:0%
65832 from s SP 154 so we're all on the
same

01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
page pre-election certificate the
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State shall prepare and
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
distribute to each town or Ward clerk
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
three copies of the pre-election
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
certificate when ballots are counted the
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
moderator and clerk shall certify
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
thereon the total number of ballots
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
received one copy shall be retained by
 
01:29:51.149 --> 01:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
the moderator for his or her records one
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
copy shall be retained for the clerk for
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
his or her records and one copy shall be
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
forwarded by the clerk to the secretary
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
of state with the election return with
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
mhe you just looking at the way it's
 
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
written it doesn't I don't think it says
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
that this these numbers not returned by
 
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
voters for instance um line 16 on the
 
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
amendment would be not returned as of
 
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
the Friday before the election you know
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
at 5:00 p.m. or no or what have you it
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
could be you know that's open to
 
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation so some might think well
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
that's the number not returned at the
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
point at which all ballots have been
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
counted on on Election
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
Day I believe that is in an RSA I just
 
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
don't have that number in front of me as
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
to uh the process and procedures of the
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
um Clerk and the absentee ballots but
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
there there is a a date where they can
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
no longer mail absentee B ballots and
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
then the latest um they can receive them
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
is 5:00 on Election Day so um they could
 
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
still re receive them on Monday prior
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
but they we're talking about mailing and
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
there and there is an RSA that does um
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
have those if anything I believe it's in
 
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.390 align:start position:0%
have those if anything I believe it's in
the

01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
workbook representative H thank you Mr
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
chair so then I think now we have two
 
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
totals of absentee ballots we have the
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots on the moderator's
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
certificate if we put in this amendment
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
that were received as of the Friday
 
01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
before election and then we have the
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
additional absentee ballots that are not
 
01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
included in that total that are received
 
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
maybe over the weekend and received on
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
Election Day
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
so so we have two different two
 
01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
different totals of absentee ballots and
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
I have a completely different question
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
about this bill that is that the
 
01:31:59.070 --> 01:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
original Bill
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
also changes the Moder the moderators
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
worksheet which is now called the
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
moderators post elction
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
certificate which actually is the
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
reconciliation of the of the votes at uh
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
on Election Day so this uh um so this
 
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
bill 152 3 would also change the
 
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
moderator's post selection certificate
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
against yes
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative you um I'm going to be
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
voting against the bill primarily
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
because I'd like to give a chance for
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
the dust to settle on HB
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
154 and then let's look at this to see
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
see if this is a problem or if because
 
01:32:58.750 --> 01:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't even gone through an election
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
cycle with
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
154 in place and just not that this may
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
not be warranted and it may give more
 
01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
transparency we just like to get a
 
01:33:12.189 --> 01:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
little more comfortable with the new
 
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
process under
 
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
154 and then come back and see if we
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
need to do this and maybe clear up some
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
of the language that's creating the
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
conversation and confusion thank you
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative Burnham thank you Mr
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
chairman so the moderator postelection
 
01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:32.229 align:start position:0%
chairman so the moderator postelection

01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%

01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
ballots and also the ones that are cast
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
on Election Day has nothing to do with
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
the ones the inventory that is being
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
tracked on the pre-election certificate
 
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't even match it's just
 
01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:51.910 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't even match it's just
it's

01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
just monitoring the amount of absentee
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
ballots that come in how many come back
 
01:33:59.950 --> 01:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
and so forth so it wouldn't have
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the moderator's
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
worksheet now because of this new form
 
01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
154 okay so I think let's clear up some
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the confusion here the problem is is
 
01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
the name pre-election certificate's
 
01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.149 align:start position:0%
the name pre-election certificate's
really

01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
confusing it really probably shouldn't
 
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
be called that um we're not going to get
 
01:34:23.109 --> 01:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
into that because when you look at it it
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
says when the Bots are counted so that's
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
not before the election that's kind of
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
immediately afterwards um so probably
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
should be called the post elction
 
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
certificate oh you're talking about the
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
physical counting of the blank ballot
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
yeah okay right Mr Mr yeah okay we're
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
talking about so we're talking about
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
that um we're talking about adding these
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
things to this list that the secretary
 
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
of state has created right because 154
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
has certain
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
requirements that the pre-election
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
certificate must have um and I think
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
think that the the opposition to it is
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's hard to determine the number of
 
01:35:00.669 --> 01:35:00.679 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots not you um not returned
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
by the voters When you're counting
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
something that could still be coming in
 
01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:07.159 align:start position:0%
right I think that's the point of
 
01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
contention is there's going to you're
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
create you're going to create this
 
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
number that's going to be inherently
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
disconnected because certain absentee
 
01:35:17.950 --> 01:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
ballots do come in on Election Day um
 
01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:19.070 align:start position:0%
ballots do come in on Election Day um
and

01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
that that's going to create theories
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
right we need recognize that that's
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
going to create
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
theories I don't like that right cuz
 
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to say look they had 30
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
absentee bouts showed up on Election Day
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
in w n in Manchester and be like yep cuz
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's how many normally get there on
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
Election Day in w n in Manchester um and
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
so like that's very
 
01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.109 align:start position:0%
so like that's very
concerning

01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
um like that's pretty much my only
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
objection to it is it's
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
like that you're using a post number in
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
a pre re elction
 
01:35:58.109 --> 01:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
certificate and that's going to create
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
theories yes rep representative Grill we
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
don't hear from representative Grill yes
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
um if the inventory count with the
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
numbers that we're looking to add in is
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
already available on Election net and
 
01:36:12.149 --> 01:36:12.159 align:start position:0%
there's already a tracking system in
 
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
place and then the concern this is
 
01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
trying to address is about sort of
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
making that available to the general
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
public would it not be possible to print
 
01:36:22.990 --> 01:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
out a report from election net and maybe
 
01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
include that with the existing
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
worksheets rather than add these extra
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
line items which I think we're getting a
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
little you know turned around trying to
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
make heads or tail of those would we not
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
be able to just print out sort of the
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
existing inventory um reporting that is
 
01:36:42.189 --> 01:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
being tracked yes B we representative B
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
fast address to her I I do agree um uh I
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
just don't know if that's what's
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
happening currently so um or if it's
 
01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:54.870 align:start position:0%
happening currently so um or if it's
consistent

01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.229 align:start position:0%
consistent
representative

01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
Brennan Mr chair um I'm hearing a lot of
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
Confusion And I I'm wondering if this
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
bill creates more confusion than is
 
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
necessary for a problem that really
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist and I'm wondering if the
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
tracking and inventory of
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
ballots um is done so sufficiently
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
already ready with the processes we have
 
01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
in place and the new processes created
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
by HB by chairman Barry's favorite bill
 
01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
um that has been signed into
 
01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
law and so I just I'm wondering if this
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
is absolutely necessary at this time and
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
if it's really just solve trying to
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
solve a problem that doesn't exist thank
 
01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Hamlet I I wish you
 
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
could all have the new pre election
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
certificate it is a pre-election
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
certificate because it says this is to
 
01:38:02.189 --> 01:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
certify that in accordance with RSA 658
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
the ballots prepared by the clerk
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
meaning the city or town clerk have been
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
examined and counted these are the blank
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
ballots have been examined and counted
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
and we find that the total number of
 
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
official ballots excluding absentee
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
ballots and ballots used to test
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting devices is so
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
they've completely eliminated the
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
confusion about the absentee ballots
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
they they don't want them in this
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
pre-election this is just to certify the
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
blank ballots that the clerk has
 
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
bill okay I guess we'll call the role on
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
the motion of O pass as
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%

01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment fails on a vote 11 to9 is
 
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
there another motion yes representative
 
01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
Lane I move I move that this bill is
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
inex expedient to legislate is there a
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
second Bon
 
01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
seconds is there a discussion on the
 
01:40:01.229 --> 01:40:01.239 align:start position:0%
motion to expedent to legislate
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative Mirad you think that
 
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
something an iron that version of this
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
could probably um generate consensus in
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
this committee might be next next
 
01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
session but seems like there's some open
 
01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
questions about exactly how to
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
operationalize it maybe we could
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
non-gain Amendment a Senate bill that
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
would be nice to nice to reverse course
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
on them for
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
once don't threaten me with a good time
 
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
don't threaten me with representative
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
Burnham I believe that the the a a quick
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
fix to this issue because yes there are
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that do arrive on
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
Election Day is that that number can be
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
on the moderator's worksheet because the
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
moderator is there to have them counted
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%

01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
to all this is on page nine line 15 I
 
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
just want everybody to kind of be able
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%

it and and get back to me um with any
 
01:45:01.589 --> 01:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
questions you might have So This Is How
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
They and this is where the schedule set
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
out this is kind of one of the the
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
critical ones that we changed so I mean
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say much more on it if
 
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
if you want to read it and give me
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
comments or if you want to ask me
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
questions about it now but it's kind of
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:31.470 align:start position:0%
 
sections

01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
that would be it I'm just awkward
 
01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
silence okay and well I didn't want to
 
01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:41.430 align:start position:0%
silence okay and well I didn't want to
rush

01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
rush
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
anybody I get accused of on the internet
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
so people are so mean on Twitter but
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
you're reading it on the internet I know
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought was hilarious like
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
but I'm reading this insult that you're
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
hurling at me you're reading this
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
insult I know right yeah there's no
 
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
actual corrective this this it's I
 
01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
noticed you don't use them much the
 
01:46:07.950 --> 01:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
first thing you do when you look at your
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
computer is take them off thing ah okay
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
all right well again can take questions
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
and we can and I'll certainly take
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
questions anytime you know give me a
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
call email me whatever you want to do
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
okay and then um the last one I just
 
01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring to everybody's attention
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
because we we it it really hasn't
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
changed much we just rearranged it well
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is second to last one are the
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
definitions of expenditure and
 
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
independent expenditure and they're on
 
01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:39.679 align:start position:0%
that sheet that I gave you and they
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
reflect some of the comments but
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
essentially we shortened um the
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
definition of independent expenditure uh
 
01:46:50.350 --> 01:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
a lot uh and and that's because we
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
defined expenditure we expanded out what
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
an expenditure was and then we just said
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
basically um an independent expenditure
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
is an expenditure that you don't do that
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
you can't do in concert or in
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
coordination with a campaign which is
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
essentially what the definition was we
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
just parsed it down a little bit more so
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
um if you want to look at the existing
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
language but the intent was not to
 
01:47:17.709 --> 01:47:17.719 align:start position:0%
really change anything there it was just
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
to make it a little more
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
clear yes sir this I'm sorry yes
 
01:47:26.830 --> 01:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
representative Howard so uh I think this
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
would be an appropriate time to bring up
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I had uh for hb1
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
1239 uh because it does address this
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
section uh so in line in the first line
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
of uh so 17 and
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
18 uh there could be uh we we could
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
insert something that states uh any
 
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
candidate whose expenditures did not
 
01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:55.629 align:start position:0%
candidate whose expenditures did not
exceed

01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:55.639 align:start position:0%
exceed
 
01:47:58.109 --> 01:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
$1,000 uh during a reporting period
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
shall attest there too by placing a
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
check mark in a check box indicating on
 
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
the reporting form and on the same
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
timelines as set out in this
 
01:48:11.229 --> 01:48:11.239 align:start position:0%
section uh the Secretary of State shall
 
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
include a a checkbox uh for this purpose
 
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
on the forms provided to candidates such
 
01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
checkbox uh shall be in
 
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
substantially uh following form of
 
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
basically stating that they did not
 
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
spend uh under $1,000 and I can provide
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh that in written uh form for uh the uh
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment for 1091 if so are you are you
 
01:48:42.589 --> 01:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
like you looking on page 10 and
 
01:48:45.149 --> 01:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
includeed as a subdivision somewhere in
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
there is that what you're saying no no
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm
 
01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
suggesting uh I mean we could
 
01:48:55.589 --> 01:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
potentially put it on page 10 I
 
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
haven't because there's not much room on
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
page 10 but the the point there's a lot
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
of room on
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
page well yeah a lot of that is existing
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of that's yeah that's kind of what
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
I was referring to but the the point
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
being is that this way we would require
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
all candidates to uh signify that they
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
hadn't spent over $1,000 uh in a
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
reporting period uh and if they
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh and if they uh haven't then they can
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
easily just say it's not uh that I'm not
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
submitting any reports it's just that
 
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not spending over ,000 dollar so
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
then uh if we have people who aren't
 
01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
submitting reports then we can have the
 
01:49:43.149 --> 01:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
uh attorney general or Secretary of
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
State reach out to them and kind of see
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
what the situation is okay yeah and and
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
I I agree it goes into this section I
 
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
think it's a good fit as long as we're
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
all comfortable with that I I think
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to do some sort of
 
01:49:59.550 --> 01:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
phase in on that we might guess yes repr
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
K thank you Mr chairman so I guess I'm
 
01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
wondering are you suggesting that
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to submit that form
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
all nine times or would it are you just
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
saying it would be one time at the end
 
01:50:11.199 --> 01:50:13.310 align:start position:0%
saying it would be one time at the end
of

01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
the cycle because to submit a form nine
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
times just saying that you haven't done
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
something it just seems quite repetitive
 
01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
especially when you consider that state
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
reps that have run many times before
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
aren't really spending much on
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
campaigning anymore because people kind
 
01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
of know them and so I think it's just
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
submitting unnecessary forms if they're
 
01:50:34.350 --> 01:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
really not Su you know spending any
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
money but if it if it's just one time
 
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps that could be something that
 
01:50:41.149 --> 01:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
could be a compromise but to submit it
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
nine times it just and then to hold you
 
01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:46.030 align:start position:0%
nine times it just and then to hold you
know

01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:50:48.189 --> 01:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
somebody have me in trouble because they
 
01:50:52.350 --> 01:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
forgot to I guess yeah uh to to respond
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think that if we did have it
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
required for only one submission it
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
would just give the Secretary of State
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to reach out to people
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
who haven't submitted these uh financial
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
statements uh to remind them hey by the
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
way if you haven't submitted these
 
01:51:13.229 --> 01:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
statements you need to uh or check this
 
01:51:13.239 --> 01:51:14.589 align:start position:0%
statements you need to uh or check this
box

01:51:14.589 --> 01:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
box
 
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
before uh there's any uh potential
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
investigation opened up beforehand if uh
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
somebody is not necessarily following uh
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
the proper financial guidelines so it it
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
is in fact just one time not all nine
 
01:51:32.589 --> 01:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
times we we could we could work
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
something like that out yeah I believe
 
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
representative Howard is saying is he's
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
open to an idea of finding a middle
 
01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
ground of people acknowledging that they
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
need to file reports
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
um even though they may not have to me
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
may not meet the threshold basically is
 
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
it my understand is like you want to
 
01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that they know that if they
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
hit the threshold they need to file and
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
you want something from them that says
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
hey I know this I'm not going to do this
 
01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
because I'm not going to spend this
 
01:51:59.229 --> 01:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
money but I know that I I know that if I
 
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
was to spend this money I would be
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
filing this stuff is that is that fair
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
statement yes yeah that that would be
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
correct yes representative BM yeah I
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
mean on
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
that we all get a form or something from
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State when we file for
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
office that you have to do this BL BL BL
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
BL so we know that but if I don't and
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
for many elections I've never filed and
 
01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
I don't don't really want to because I
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
don't make it and so I don't think
 
01:52:29.069 --> 01:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
forcing somebody to file they know what
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
the law says so why should they even
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
have to fill out a form saying that's
 
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
just extra paperwork for me the
 
01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:41.159 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and and forever so I
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
think the Counterpoint is you don't know
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
that they know what the law says because
 
01:52:45.550 --> 01:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
you get a packet in the mail you throw
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
it away this is this is more of an
 
01:52:50.189 --> 01:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
affirm the difference between this is it
 
01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
becomes it goes from being a passive
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
notification to an active affirmation of
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
of saying you understand it
 
01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:57.669 align:start position:0%
of saying you understand it
representative

01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
qu yes I I I don't agree with the
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
amendment because I think we have a
 
01:53:05.310 --> 01:53:05.320 align:start position:0%
presumption in this country that if
 
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
you're there's no evidence that you're
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
breaking the law you're not pursued and
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have to routinely make an
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
affirmation that you're following the
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
law I think that's important and it
 
01:53:18.189 --> 01:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
imposes an extra burden on candidates in
 
01:53:20.589 --> 01:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
terms of paperwork uh the way the
 
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is written I believe it
 
01:53:24.189 --> 01:53:24.199 align:start position:0%
requires such
 
01:53:28.589 --> 01:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
a uh report at every reporting period so
 
01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
that is a significant burden especially
 
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
for people who are not incurring high
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
expenses but for me it's the the
 
01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
presumption that we have not broken the
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
law unless evidence is presented we're
 
01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:42.790 align:start position:0%
law unless evidence is presented we're
not

01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
pursued so that's my view on I I I don't
 
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
I don't support your mment for that
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
reason tell we're going to put a pin in
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
that one and come back to it because I
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
think there's more to explore and we are
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
coming up on the noon and I have a
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
meeting at 12:30 so I want to grab lunch
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
um uh you guys know how I feel about
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
lunch um the only other thing that I
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to toss out there and we won't
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
talk about it right now is I want to
 
01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:06.350 align:start position:0%
talk about it right now is I want to
talk

01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
about represent Lane in this
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
amendment talk about making the
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
disclaimers all the same um and I would
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
really love to get rid of the
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
address um the printed address on the
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
political advertisement the paid
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
political advertisement leave
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
the committee or the candidates name on
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
it the person paying the entity paying
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
for it leave that on there and they have
 
01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
to be registered with the secretary of
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
state and all that information is
 
01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
available on the Secretary of State's
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
website but it really just is like silly
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
that you have to print the address on
 
01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
something um when you know if you're
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
trying to say it could be out of state
 
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
they could get a PO Box in state like
 
01:54:55.470 --> 01:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
right no way but if yeah so if it's
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
available I think one one thing we did
 
01:54:59.709 --> 01:54:59.719 align:start position:0%
was it was available on the Secretary of
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
State's website and another that if they
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
put a website the website had to have
 
01:55:08.189 --> 01:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
the whole their website had to have it
 
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
is that similar or it's similar so so
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
the current law for political signage is
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
you have to have the paid for by right
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
paid for by committee name and then
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
underneath it you have to have either
 
01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:19.189 align:start position:0%
underneath it you have to have either
the

01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh chairman or a chairman or treasurer's
 
01:55:29.950 --> 01:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
name and full address or you can
 
01:55:31.629 --> 01:55:31.639 align:start position:0%
supplant all of that with just the
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
website so long as the website has that
 
01:55:37.149 --> 01:55:37.159 align:start position:0%
information um so I I would like to see
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
that I really want to get those
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
addresses dropped off just because they
 
01:55:39.679 --> 01:55:40.990 align:start position:0%
addresses dropped off just because they
are

01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
like it's just kind of wild like to put
 
01:55:45.550 --> 01:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
especially on digital a if you read it
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
literally you're supposed to have it on
 
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
digital advertisement and if you try to
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
put that on a 50 by 300 Banner it takes
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.550 --> 01:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
advertisement so I don't know I don't
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
know how people feel about that I mean I
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
I guess I kind of like to know where
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
they're coming from I'm a little nervous
 
01:56:10.109 --> 01:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
that they they won't be filing with the
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State I mean they're GNA
 
01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
have to spend what a$ thousand dollars
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
my uh to file my counter pun my
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
Counterpoint to that would be if they're
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
not fine with the Secretary of State
 
01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
what makes you think they're going to
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
follow the disclaimer to begin
 
01:56:21.239 --> 01:56:23.669 align:start position:0%
follow the disclaimer to begin
with

01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's why we have the uh enforcement
 
01:56:27.149 --> 01:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
Provisions at the end of the bill there
 
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
you go all right we're going to break
 
01:56:31.149 --> 01:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
for lunch M Mr chairman yes I would two
 
01:56:34.510 --> 01:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
things and I will be brief and I mean
 
01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
it representative Lane and I have
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
discussed uh where there's an exception
 
01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
for registration of a political
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
committee which exempts a political
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
Committee of a political party and I I
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
believe we're agree that that exemption
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
is appropriate so you we still agree on
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh my my view as full disclosure
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
chairman of a regional thre toown Pol uh
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
political Committee of a political party
 
01:57:07.069 --> 01:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
is that it it does tend to reduce the
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
administrative overhead for operations
 
01:57:11.709 --> 01:57:11.719 align:start position:0%
which are on a very small scale quite
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
often of course if expenses or receipts
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
exceed a $1,000 for such a committee
 
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
they still have to register and report
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
it so that was one thing uh and the
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
second thing is and going through this
 
01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
in detail over the weekend I have noted
 
01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
a number of uh things that you and I
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
could probably discuss that are more or
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
less typos so I want to suggest that we
 
01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
do that and I think that was brief thank
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
you I just want to say you don't have to
 
01:57:38.189 --> 01:57:38.199 align:start position:0%
say that you're the chairman of a three
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
toal committee you can just say that
 
01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:41.560 align:start position:0%
you're a big wig party boss and we'll
 
01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
all be fine with that only I'll see you
 
01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:47.560 align:start position:0%

Hampshire I always hear that Live Free
 
03:04:44.830 --> 03:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
or Die motto is a big one the old man in
 
03:04:48.030 --> 03:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
the mountain in our first nation primary
 
03:04:50.309 --> 03:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
well we all know we already lost the old
 
03:04:53.269 --> 03:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
man unfortunately and so we lost one
 
03:04:55.429 --> 03:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
tradition and this first in the nation
 
03:04:56.830 --> 03:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
primary has been a tradition in the
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
state for 100 years over that and we've
 
03:05:03.349 --> 03:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
done our elections the right way we have
 
03:05:07.990 --> 03:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
extremely high turnout and this is a now
 
03:05:09.990 --> 03:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
a thing because here in New Hampshire we
 
03:05:11.750 --> 03:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
made it a thing it was not something no
 
03:05:14.469 --> 03:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
one wanted to go first a 100 years ago
 
03:05:16.990 --> 03:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
but because we made it a tradition and
 
03:05:18.510 --> 03:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
what is brings to the state and really
 
03:05:22.670 --> 03:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
gives us um puts us on the map now you
 
03:05:24.750 --> 03:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
you see out out of state political
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
organizations want to take it away you
 
03:05:29.309 --> 03:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
had you had a few terms ago uh back in
 
03:05:30.469 --> 03:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:05:34.229 --> 03:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
2016 in 2012 it was the Republican
 
03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
National Committee that was trying to
 
03:05:38.830 --> 03:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
bump bump us from our primary now you
 
03:05:40.349 --> 03:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
have this time you have the Democratic
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
National Committee doing it and then
 
03:05:44.269 --> 03:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
that seems to volley back and forth
 
03:05:46.510 --> 03:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
depending on what's going on in in the
 
03:05:48.510 --> 03:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
political climate but timately we've
 
03:05:50.750 --> 03:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
always stood strong but what's changed
 
03:05:53.190 --> 03:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
is the is the amount of pressure these
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
aate political organizations are trying
 
03:05:57.429 --> 03:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
to put on the elected officials to get
 
03:06:00.309 --> 03:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
them to change our tradition to
 
03:06:02.429 --> 03:06:02.439 align:start position:0%
accomplish their their motives and their
 
03:06:04.750 --> 03:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
agenda not a New Hampshire agenda that's
 
03:06:06.790 --> 03:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
an anti- New Hampshire position to take
 
03:06:09.110 --> 03:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
is to give up our primary by putting it
 
03:06:10.710 --> 03:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
into Constitution where I believe where
 
03:06:13.309 --> 03:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
it should it should go uh they can put
 
03:06:15.229 --> 03:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
all the pressure they want but the
 
03:06:16.309 --> 03:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
right's not going to be given to the
 
03:06:19.590 --> 03:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
people and I hear some people say should
 
03:06:21.950 --> 03:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
this go in the Constitution or not if
 
03:06:23.150 --> 03:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
you go through the New Hampshire
 
03:06:25.550 --> 03:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution there are plenty of
 
03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
election Provisions in the Constitution
 
03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's qualifications for office
 
03:06:33.710 --> 03:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
length of terms when the elections are
 
03:06:37.590 --> 03:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
when the terms begin absentee ballots
 
03:06:39.590 --> 03:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
disqualifications you name it there's a
 
03:06:43.110 --> 03:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
lot in there uh involving um
 
03:06:45.510 --> 03:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications of to vote filling
 
03:06:46.590 --> 03:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
vacancies these are all in the
 
03:06:48.950 --> 03:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution so so there's no reason why
 
03:06:50.670 --> 03:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
this couldn't go into the
 
03:06:52.670 --> 03:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution I think it's important to
 
03:06:55.269 --> 03:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
look at the economic benefits our state
 
03:06:56.990 --> 03:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
gets especially when you don't have an
 
03:06:59.469 --> 03:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
incumbent or a former president running
 
03:06:59.479 --> 03:07:00.229 align:start position:0%
incumbent or a former president running
for

03:07:00.229 --> 03:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:07:03.389 --> 03:07:03.399 align:start position:0%
re-election uh seeking because what
 
03:07:06.910 --> 03:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
happens is you have basically you 10 15
 
03:07:09.389 --> 03:07:09.399 align:start position:0%
20 candidates on each side we're talking
 
03:07:13.030 --> 03:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
about office space they rent a venues uh
 
03:07:15.950 --> 03:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
obviously they have staff it's hotels a
 
03:07:17.630 --> 03:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
lot of rooms and meals Revenue comes
 
03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
from that they
 
03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
approximately when you have a um a
 
03:07:24.389 --> 03:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
non-incumbents running on both sides
 
03:07:25.710 --> 03:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
you're looking at around two billion
 
03:07:27.710 --> 03:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
dollars in economic activity for the
 
03:07:30.229 --> 03:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
state and that's a huge boost in our
 
03:07:33.590 --> 03:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue so I think that's something to
 
03:07:34.910 --> 03:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
keep in mind as well when I say this is
 
03:07:37.229 --> 03:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
an anti-new Hampshire position that's
 
03:07:39.550 --> 03:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
why I take that as beyond our tradition
 
03:07:42.190 --> 03:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
we've made it a thing there's diners and
 
03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's certain pit stops that have
 
03:07:47.870 --> 03:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
become a tradition to stop at so I look
 
03:07:50.190 --> 03:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
into why the narrative to take it to
 
03:07:52.670 --> 03:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
take our primary way and maybe that's
 
03:07:54.670 --> 03:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
just political rhetoric and
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
grandstanding but it really criticizes
 
03:07:57.990 --> 03:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire voters in our
 
03:08:00.429 --> 03:08:00.439 align:start position:0%
demographics that's just not fair to the
 
03:08:02.349 --> 03:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voters it's not fair to
 
03:08:05.309 --> 03:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
the elected officials in this state it
 
03:08:07.469 --> 03:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
they claim that we lack diversity and
 
03:08:09.269 --> 03:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
therefore are not worthy of the primary
 
03:08:11.469 --> 03:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
any further and I think that's insulting
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire voters because
 
03:08:14.950 --> 03:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
minority candidates in this state have
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
performed exceptionally well go on both
 
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
both sides Barack Obama won the state
 
03:08:22.950 --> 03:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
twice in in 2008 and
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
2012 uh you saw in the second
 
03:08:26.830 --> 03:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
congressional district Steve Negron won
 
03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
the Primary twice he's American but he's
 
03:08:31.670 --> 03:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
his ancestry is both Puerto Rican and
 
03:08:32.990 --> 03:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
and Mexican
 
03:08:35.110 --> 03:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
descent I'm of Middle Eastern descent
 
03:08:37.870 --> 03:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
and I won my race for state senate by 25
 
03:08:40.349 --> 03:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
points so where we lack in diversity
 
03:08:42.710 --> 03:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
certainly minority candidates do have
 
03:08:44.670 --> 03:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to perform well I think we
 
03:08:47.870 --> 03:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
have you combine that with our turnout
 
03:08:50.710 --> 03:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
um minority candidates um have a good
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
chance of getting elected this is what I
 
03:08:54.309 --> 03:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
can tell so I think it's wrong to
 
03:08:56.349 --> 03:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps attack our tradition we're based
 
03:08:58.389 --> 03:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
on the demographics especially because
 
03:09:00.389 --> 03:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
we really can't control who lives here
 
03:09:02.710 --> 03:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
and who doesn't based on that so I think
 
03:09:06.190 --> 03:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's inherently wrong uh I think what
 
03:09:08.469 --> 03:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
what's happening now is by putting this
 
03:09:10.309 --> 03:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution none of us would
 
03:09:11.990 --> 03:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
ever have to worry about the out ofate
 
03:09:14.110 --> 03:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
pressure again so I hope you would all
 
03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
support this I know there's been
 
03:09:17.670 --> 03:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
different polls on whether this the
 
03:09:19.870 --> 03:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
people would support this I think if you
 
03:09:22.110 --> 03:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
look at the undecided the this if you
 
03:09:24.190 --> 03:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
exclude that number the over this would
 
03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
pass overwhelmingly on the ballot um
 
03:09:29.950 --> 03:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's supported by both parties so I
 
03:09:32.229 --> 03:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
don't think this is a really a partis an
 
03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
issue this is an out of New Hampshire
 
03:09:35.110 --> 03:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
out of state New Hampshire issue or
 
03:09:37.389 --> 03:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
instate issue and I think if you want to
 
03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
support New Hampshire you would support
 
03:09:41.349 --> 03:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
putting this into the Constitution if
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
you want to give into the OT of State
 
03:09:45.190 --> 03:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
pressure or the DC
 
03:09:46.910 --> 03:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
politics I guess that's that's the
 
03:09:48.670 --> 03:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
decision to be made here I know where I
 
03:09:51.670 --> 03:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
would stand so I'll answer any questions
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
are questions from the committee
 
03:09:55.469 --> 03:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet thank you Mr chair
 
03:09:58.229 --> 03:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so what
 
03:10:00.830 --> 03:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
would happen if another state decided to
 
03:10:03.750 --> 03:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
put put it in their constitution that
 
03:10:05.429 --> 03:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be first in the nation or
 
03:10:07.510 --> 03:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to be you know one week before
 
03:10:10.229 --> 03:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
any other election how how would that
 
03:10:12.269 --> 03:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
work would we sue
 
03:10:14.389 --> 03:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
them well I don't think we would sue
 
03:10:16.190 --> 03:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
them they can do that now with the
 
03:10:18.870 --> 03:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
current law if they so wanted to so
 
03:10:21.030 --> 03:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a problem either way I
 
03:10:22.630 --> 03:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
just know that the only way to protect
 
03:10:25.269 --> 03:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
our first nation primary more than
 
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
having it in RSA is by putting it into
 
03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
the Constitution because then to CH
 
03:10:32.030 --> 03:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
change that you would have to basically
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
go through this whole cacr process can
 
03:10:36.110 --> 03:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
put on the ballot because what's
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
happening now
 
03:10:40.590 --> 03:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
is when they when the pressure that was
 
03:10:43.110 --> 03:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
put on this go around it wasn't just to
 
03:10:44.469 --> 03:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
change our primary date they wanted to
 
03:10:46.510 --> 03:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
change a lot of our election laws as
 
03:10:49.630 --> 03:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
well which in INF fairness to to any
 
03:10:51.750 --> 03:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
political party it's kind of hard to
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
hold hold a political party to that
 
03:10:57.070 --> 03:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
standard if they to pass and change all
 
03:10:58.309 --> 03:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
these laws in order to maintain their
 
03:11:00.030 --> 03:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
first nation primary it that doesn't
 
03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
seem like that really makes sense they
 
03:11:03.790 --> 03:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to deliver on that I'm
 
03:11:05.229 --> 03:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
not saying they would I'm not sure they
 
03:11:07.150 --> 03:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
could have so again to penalize the
 
03:11:09.150 --> 03:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
Democratic party for that seemed very
 
03:11:11.309 --> 03:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
disingenuous to me and I think as New
 
03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters and we should always
 
03:11:16.510 --> 03:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
stand up for all voters As Americans we
 
03:11:18.429 --> 03:11:18.439 align:start position:0%
want we don't want to be disenfranchised
 
03:11:19.990 --> 03:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
like that so I think sticking together
 
03:11:23.269 --> 03:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:25.950 --> 03:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
dohe you thank you Senator do do you
 
03:11:28.030 --> 03:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
think that this an amendment like this
 
03:11:29.550 --> 03:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
might also serve a kind of a civic
 
03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:30.910 align:start position:0%
might also serve a kind of a civic
education

03:11:30.910 --> 03:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:11:33.870 --> 03:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
function um I was surprised this past
 
03:11:37.150 --> 03:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
winter at at how um few reporters
 
03:11:39.070 --> 03:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
understood that elections are
 
03:11:42.950 --> 03:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
administered by States not by national
 
03:11:45.070 --> 03:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
parties in fact I was kind of surprised
 
03:11:46.429 --> 03:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
that the national parties didn't
 
03:11:47.349 --> 03:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
understand that elections are
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
administered by States and are regulated
 
03:11:52.750 --> 03:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
by state laws and so maybe putting this
 
03:11:54.229 --> 03:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
in a very visible place like the
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution which I ordinarily wouldn't
 
03:11:56.910 --> 03:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
want to muck with anymore than
 
03:11:59.429 --> 03:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary might serve a civic
 
03:12:01.990 --> 03:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
education function it most certainly
 
03:12:03.710 --> 03:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
would and I'm I'm still not clear that
 
03:12:06.870 --> 03:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
the some of the the national parties
 
03:12:08.429 --> 03:12:08.439 align:start position:0%
understand that either either they think
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
that they can control how the the
 
03:12:12.830 --> 03:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
elections are performed every state has
 
03:12:15.550 --> 03:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
their own process and own election laws
 
03:12:18.550 --> 03:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
and what what qualifications it takes to
 
03:12:20.110 --> 03:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
be a state representative State Senate
 
03:12:22.309 --> 03:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's different the terms are different
 
03:12:24.750 --> 03:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
so I think for us it's also promoting
 
03:12:26.590 --> 03:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
our tradition in in preserving it and I
 
03:12:27.790 --> 03:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
think that's something that a lot of
 
03:12:30.269 --> 03:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
people you you some people take it for
 
03:12:31.590 --> 03:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
granted I think it's just something
 
03:12:32.830 --> 03:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
that's always been there it's been there
 
03:12:34.750 --> 03:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
my entire lifetime all of our lifetime
 
03:12:37.469 --> 03:12:37.479 align:start position:0%
it's kind of always been but when I say
 
03:12:39.229 --> 03:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
the it's this push to take it away is
 
03:12:40.790 --> 03:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
getting stronger and stronger and
 
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
stronger so I think Now's the Time to
 
03:12:45.429 --> 03:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
let's let's put a stamp on that
 
03:12:47.710 --> 03:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
03:12:49.190 --> 03:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you senator for
 
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so for our
 
03:12:54.510 --> 03:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
University students whether that be
 
03:12:57.269 --> 03:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth people currently attending uh
 
03:13:00.550 --> 03:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
our University system uh or attending
 
03:13:03.469 --> 03:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
say St ansam uh and their Institute of
 
03:13:06.830 --> 03:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
politics do you think that this would
 
03:13:09.710 --> 03:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
help protect those institutions in their
 
03:13:13.429 --> 03:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
ability to recruit students over this uh
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
kind of uh monumentous event that we
 
03:13:19.990 --> 03:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
take place every four years that draws
 
03:13:21.870 --> 03:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
people in so that they can experience
 
03:13:23.670 --> 03:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
this presidential
 
03:13:27.070 --> 03:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
cycle absolutely and you see I mentioned
 
03:13:29.150 --> 03:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
that we have much higher voter turnout
 
03:13:32.110 --> 03:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
than other states and I think that a lot
 
03:13:34.110 --> 03:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
of it is to attribute to the Civic
 
03:13:36.910 --> 03:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
involvement and a big part of that is
 
03:13:39.309 --> 03:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
the presidential primary I
 
03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
mean just myself I get to meet numerous
 
03:13:46.150 --> 03:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
candidates um throughout the the primary
 
03:13:48.070 --> 03:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
process and that's a once in a-lifetime
 
03:13:49.950 --> 03:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a lot of people for you
 
03:13:52.510 --> 03:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
to be you know at a diner and see you
 
03:13:54.389 --> 03:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
know Senator Scott or Governor Dan
 
03:13:55.830 --> 03:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
santis I mean you would just see these
 
03:13:55.840 --> 03:13:56.710 align:start position:0%
santis I mean you would just see these
people

03:13:56.710 --> 03:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:13:58.990 --> 03:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
running you would just happen to run
 
03:14:00.550 --> 03:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
into them sometimes when you're out in
 
03:14:03.110 --> 03:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
the boat that's amazing and what's
 
03:14:04.950 --> 03:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
really impressive and if you go back to
 
03:14:07.710 --> 03:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
2020 in the primary you had candidates
 
03:14:09.150 --> 03:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
perform really well in the state that
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have a war chest I think mayor
 
03:14:13.550 --> 03:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
Pete Budaj did an excellent job he I
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
think he came in second but he left tied
 
03:14:16.710 --> 03:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
with the most delegates with Senator
 
03:14:16.720 --> 03:14:17.950 align:start position:0%
with the most delegates with Senator
sand

03:14:17.950 --> 03:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
sand
 
03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
and not if you if you put South Carolina
 
03:14:22.950 --> 03:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
California any of those States ahead
 
03:14:24.070 --> 03:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to need a war chest in
 
03:14:26.229 --> 03:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
those much bigger States I think someone
 
03:14:27.630 --> 03:14:27.640 align:start position:0%
like himself he really made a name of
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
himself in the state and was able to do
 
03:14:32.190 --> 03:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
that where not every candidate can do
 
03:14:33.910 --> 03:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
that but he did at the Grassroots level
 
03:14:35.870 --> 03:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that Civic involvement
 
03:14:37.429 --> 03:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
whether you're a Republican or Democrat
 
03:14:42.990 --> 03:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:45.229 --> 03:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
altogether questions from the
 
03:14:48.150 --> 03:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative PR O'Brien
 
03:14:52.150 --> 03:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my question is how does the
 
03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Primary in your opinion
 
03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
benefit the entire country uh I I think
 
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
it does do you agree with that I think
 
03:15:07.229 --> 03:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
it it benefits the entire country
 
03:15:09.870 --> 03:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
tremendously I it does and as I was
 
03:15:12.269 --> 03:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
saying before many years ago no one
 
03:15:15.229 --> 03:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to go first it was the opposite
 
03:15:16.590 --> 03:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
we were first everyone was happy because
 
03:15:18.070 --> 03:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
it good you don't want to go first
 
03:15:20.189 --> 03:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of pressure because
 
03:15:22.590 --> 03:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
everyone's watching and you saw what
 
03:15:25.710 --> 03:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
happened in Iowa in 2020 didn't go well
 
03:15:27.910 --> 03:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
they're still getting criticized for it
 
03:15:30.030 --> 03:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
we we have not had that problem here
 
03:15:31.670 --> 03:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
we've always done a good job so I think
 
03:15:34.630 --> 03:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
we set the tone I also think that you
 
03:15:37.710 --> 03:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
have again without that war chest it's a
 
03:15:41.229 --> 03:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
way to G gain momentum going going
 
03:15:43.830 --> 03:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
forward as you head towards super
 
03:15:47.469 --> 03:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and you saw um
 
03:15:49.269 --> 03:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
Senator kobasa have a really good
 
03:15:50.910 --> 03:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
performance in her debate you she was
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
projected to finish much lower and she
 
03:15:55.550 --> 03:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
jumped right up the ladder and that was
 
03:15:56.750 --> 03:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
kind of one of the talking points
 
03:16:00.269 --> 03:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
leaving the 2020 primary so I think if
 
03:16:02.309 --> 03:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
you look at how that benefits
 
03:16:05.790 --> 03:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
us amazing plus the economic benefit I
 
03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
always will go back to that just from a
 
03:16:09.990 --> 03:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
pure Revenue perspective we shouldn't
 
03:16:12.469 --> 03:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
give this up and again it's protected
 
03:16:15.910 --> 03:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:15.920 --> 03:16:17.429 align:start position:0%
 
now

03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:16:18.550 --> 03:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee there's
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
like a delay on the microphones today
 
03:16:22.750 --> 03:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you Senator abbis um
 
03:16:24.349 --> 03:16:24.359 align:start position:0%

03:16:25.429 --> 03:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
speak to this bill I don't have any
 
03:16:27.309 --> 03:16:27.319 align:start position:0%

03:16:33.550 --> 03:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
uh blue sheet for me and I will get the
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not wasn't ready for that one so
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:43.710 --> 03:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
blank oh three
 
03:16:48.950 --> 03:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
Nam okay
 
03:16:52.030 --> 03:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
um there were two people signed in in
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
support that did not speak online there
 
03:16:59.910 --> 03:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
were give me a quick
 
03:17:02.990 --> 03:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
second we can't go anywhere till 125

close the public hearing on cacr
 
03:17:15.349 --> 03:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
22 and the committee will stand in
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%

welcome to the house election law
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
committee my name is James Gray I
 
03:27:10.269 --> 03:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
represent Senate District 6 which starts
 
03:27:12.870 --> 03:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
up in Alton gilmington comes down Route
 
03:27:15.590 --> 03:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
11 to Rochester uh and I want you to
 
03:27:17.790 --> 03:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
know Mr the chair that uh right over
 
03:27:19.870 --> 03:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
there where representative akerberg is
 
03:27:21.710 --> 03:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
sitting that's where the first seat that
 
03:27:25.469 --> 03:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
I had uh in the house committee when I
 
03:27:29.990 --> 03:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
was uh first serving uh 10 years ago uh
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to get you back on
 
03:27:34.870 --> 03:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
break real quick uh it was a request of
 
03:27:37.189 --> 03:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State if you look at
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
the bill uh line uh 14 and 15 uh the
 
03:27:46.630 --> 03:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
current uh form would have the secretary
 
03:27:49.510 --> 03:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
State uh enter the date of the primary
 
03:27:52.389 --> 03:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
when people are signing up for the
 
03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
primary and as we have seen with more
 
03:27:58.030 --> 03:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
and more challenges to the first in the
 
03:28:01.309 --> 03:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
nation status uh he would like to re uh
 
03:28:04.030 --> 03:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
put that instead of having to put in the
 
03:28:06.630 --> 03:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
date in that form a date so designated
 
03:28:08.710 --> 03:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state which is what
 
03:28:11.790 --> 03:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
the rest of the law says uh in different
 
03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
places so that the form would just be
 
03:28:16.670 --> 03:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
modified so that uh
 
03:28:19.309 --> 03:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh he did not have to put a date in
 
03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
there uh which then he would resend
 
03:28:25.030 --> 03:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
later by having to move the primary and
 
03:28:26.870 --> 03:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
if there's any questions I'd be happy to
 
03:28:28.590 --> 03:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
answer them but this should get you back
 
03:28:31.389 --> 03:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
on break real quick all right questions
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
from the committee for Senator
 
03:28:45.030 --> 03:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:45.040 --> 03:29:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:29:15.030 --> 03:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.040 --> 03:29:17.309 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:29:17.309 --> 03:29:17.319 align:start position:0%
e
 
03:29:18.349 --> 03:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll do this on the microphone
 
03:29:21.150 --> 03:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm talking the rule was before this
 
03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
year the chair could call the vote
 
03:29:25.590 --> 03:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
immediately after a bill when we entered
 
03:29:29.309 --> 03:29:29.319 align:start position:0%
the uh 201199 world we changed the rule
 
03:29:30.830 --> 03:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
to where the chair can call the vote
 
03:29:33.030 --> 03:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
with the consent of the of the ranking
 
03:29:35.990 --> 03:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
member so I'm asking the ranking member
 
03:29:38.910 --> 03:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
if she's for the point of expediency we
 
03:29:41.070 --> 03:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
had no questions it's a housekeeping
 
03:29:43.790 --> 03:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
bill can we just take the vote now and
 
03:29:45.070 --> 03:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
that way I can write the report and we
 
03:29:46.910 --> 03:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
can dispense with the
 
03:29:46.920 --> 03:29:48.910 align:start position:0%
can dispense with the
Bill

03:29:48.910 --> 03:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:29:52.510 --> 03:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
answer yes it's we got 14 okay all right
 
03:29:53.590 --> 03:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
so with that we're going to end the
 
03:29:55.150 --> 03:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
period of executive session on Senate
 
03:29:58.070 --> 03:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 344 I will move the bill as ought
 
03:30:00.790 --> 03:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
to pass is there a second I'll second
 
03:30:02.349 --> 03:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
representative Lane second is there any
 
03:30:04.309 --> 03:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
 
03:30:06.510 --> 03:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
bill about as much about as many
 
03:30:07.790 --> 03:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
questions as there were all right with
 
03:30:09.590 --> 03:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
that the clerk will call the role on the
 
03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:17.710 --> 03:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
344 she wasn't ready for this one I
 
03:30:18.830 --> 03:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
don't even have a form I'm just rating
 
03:30:20.910 --> 03:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
it it's okay I I I have a feeling it's G

03:52:32.110 --> 03:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um Senator Tim Lang um as many
 
03:52:33.750 --> 03:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
of you know I I sered three terms in the
 
03:52:36.389 --> 03:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
house including one on Election law and
 
03:52:39.510 --> 03:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh now am I as a freshman Senator uh in
 
03:52:41.710 --> 03:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and I'm an associate
 
03:52:44.670 --> 03:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
member of the uh karaoke caucus as it
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
goes uh other that just means I'll go
 
03:52:49.469 --> 03:52:49.479 align:start position:0%
but I won't sing so which is a benefit
 
03:52:52.510 --> 03:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
to everybody anyway so um I'm here to
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
introduce the moving the state primary
 
03:52:56.910 --> 03:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
bill um that bill it's a real simple
 
03:52:59.870 --> 03:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
Bill we push everything back 90 days um
 
03:53:01.790 --> 03:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
so all the filing dates get pushed back
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
90 days the vote will be the second
 
03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
Tuesday in June um the primary reason
 
03:53:08.670 --> 03:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
why you have this bill in front of you
 
03:53:11.870 --> 03:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
as many of you know it's it's a struggle
 
03:53:14.070 --> 03:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes to get in front of the voter
 
03:53:15.070 --> 03:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
in that
 
03:53:17.030 --> 03:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
really small window we have between
 
03:53:19.510 --> 03:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
September and November um in some days
 
03:53:22.269 --> 03:53:22.279 align:start position:0%
it's less than 60 days you ask for a
 
03:53:24.269 --> 03:53:24.279 align:start position:0%
recount after the recount period and
 
03:53:27.510 --> 03:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
everything else so the idea being is you
 
03:53:30.189 --> 03:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
have such a small window of time to get
 
03:53:32.309 --> 03:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
elected um to get out to the general
 
03:53:36.590 --> 03:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
voter um we're all all politicians so we
 
03:53:37.990 --> 03:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
all know that when you're talking in the
 
03:53:39.510 --> 03:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
primary you're talking to your side of
 
03:53:40.870 --> 03:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
the aisle and your and that's a
 
03:53:42.670 --> 03:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
different discussion Point than when
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking to um the entire
 
03:53:47.110 --> 03:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
electorate all together um the topics
 
03:53:48.189 --> 03:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
you might cover are going to be
 
03:53:50.670 --> 03:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
different so what this bill seeks to do
 
03:53:53.710 --> 03:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
is give the general election voter the
 
03:53:55.790 --> 03:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
most amount of time to vet the
 
03:53:57.229 --> 03:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
candidates and to view the candidates
 
03:53:59.710 --> 03:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
and get to meet the candidates so we'll
 
03:54:02.710 --> 03:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
have um a March filing period with a
 
03:54:04.630 --> 03:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
June primary and that gives you from
 
03:54:07.070 --> 03:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
June until November to get out into your
 
03:54:09.389 --> 03:54:09.399 align:start position:0%
community to meet all of your citizens
 
03:54:10.910 --> 03:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
not just the citizens that happen to
 
03:54:12.590 --> 03:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
have the same letter after their name as
 
03:54:14.429 --> 03:54:14.439 align:start position:0%
you do but gets you to get to every
 
03:54:16.870 --> 03:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
everybody um and and be able to have
 
03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
them ask you questions and get things it
 
03:54:21.429 --> 03:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
gives the voter the greatest opportunity
 
03:54:23.710 --> 03:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
to to realize who they're going to vote
 
03:54:26.910 --> 03:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
for in November as simple as
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
that are there questions for Senator
 
03:54:33.750 --> 03:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
Timothy Lang yes representative Lane
 
03:54:37.389 --> 03:54:37.399 align:start position:0%
welcome back Senator thank you
 
03:54:41.950 --> 03:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
um not to make it all about me but we're
 
03:54:44.469 --> 03:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
politicians I understand but this means
 
03:54:47.710 --> 03:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
said I will be running during budget
 
03:54:51.950 --> 03:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
session during and we have no staff the
 
03:54:54.189 --> 03:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
house people have no staff nobody you
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
know so it makes it a little difficult
 
03:55:00.110 --> 03:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
to run a campaign and do the work of the
 
03:55:03.429 --> 03:55:03.439 align:start position:0%
house which um I'm just wondering if
 
03:55:05.149 --> 03:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
this doesn't even make it harder for
 
03:55:07.990 --> 03:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
people to do this job and discourage
 
03:55:09.870 --> 03:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
people from doing this job because it's
 
03:55:11.510 --> 03:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
a burnout it's a high burnout thank you
 
03:55:12.750 --> 03:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
for the question so again remember it's
 
03:55:14.630 --> 03:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
not a budget cycle right right we're in
 
03:55:16.950 --> 03:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
the second year budget's over right so
 
03:55:18.710 --> 03:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a budget cycle year that you'll
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
be running in um generally second year
 
03:55:23.429 --> 03:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
bills are generally policy bills or or
 
03:55:26.950 --> 03:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
procedural bills um so I I'll be
 
03:55:28.870 --> 03:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
undergoing the same problem you will um
 
03:55:30.070 --> 03:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
and and be honest with the Senate's
 
03:55:32.429 --> 03:55:32.439 align:start position:0%
worse and when it comes to the second
 
03:55:34.229 --> 03:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
half of the year because we have the
 
03:55:35.910 --> 03:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds of bills you guys send us where
 
03:55:38.389 --> 03:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
you might have the 50 or 75 that we send
 
03:55:41.550 --> 03:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
you um and so it actually makes it worse
 
03:55:44.070 --> 03:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
for the Senate to run but the way I look
 
03:55:48.149 --> 03:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
at is this way is generally um you're
 
03:55:49.910 --> 03:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
running for office all the time right
 
03:55:51.870 --> 03:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
the reality is that you're you're you're
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
in front of your voters on a regular
 
03:55:55.630 --> 03:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
basis uh I know that I take way more
 
03:55:57.550 --> 03:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
constituent requests now and speak to
 
03:56:01.149 --> 03:56:01.159 align:start position:0%
constituents now um in this cycle so
 
03:56:02.910 --> 03:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
it's a it's not a budgetary year which
 
03:56:04.229 --> 03:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
would have been a problem if it was and
 
03:56:06.189 --> 03:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
I agree with you but it's not um it
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
tends to be a policy year or a
 
03:56:10.149 --> 03:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
procedural year um not a budgetary year
 
03:56:14.670 --> 03:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
so I think that makes it easier um and
 
03:56:16.750 --> 03:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
was about the best I can say for you so
 
03:56:18.349 --> 03:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
I do realize we'll be working and it is
 
03:56:21.469 --> 03:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
going to increase our work effort
 
03:56:23.990 --> 03:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
um nature of the job it's what we sign
 
03:56:26.910 --> 03:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
up for if I may a representative Lane if
 
03:56:28.030 --> 03:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
it's all about you may ask you a
 
03:56:30.990 --> 03:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:33.389 --> 03:56:33.399 align:start position:0%
okay can you describe to me when the
 
03:56:36.189 --> 03:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
last time you had a primary
 
03:56:39.389 --> 03:56:39.399 align:start position:0%
was I haven't had a primary but I'm the
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
exception I live in a very safe blue W
 
03:56:45.630 --> 03:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't that make you more likely to
 
03:56:45.640 --> 03:56:47.630 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't that make you more likely to
be

03:56:47.630 --> 03:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:56:51.510 --> 03:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
primary no I have General but but I I
 
03:56:53.870 --> 03:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
understand I guess my concern is
 
03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
actually recruiting people to do to do
 
03:56:59.309 --> 03:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
this I mean it is hard enough to recruit
 
03:57:00.990 --> 03:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
folks to do it and if you're going to
 
03:57:03.630 --> 03:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
tell them in in your second year not
 
03:57:05.469 --> 03:57:05.479 align:start position:0%
only are you going to be because this
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
March has been crazy I mean we have had
 
03:57:11.349 --> 03:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills and
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
so and then you're also going to be
 
03:57:16.149 --> 03:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
running a camp pain I I worry more for
 
03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
people who are going to try and and and
 
03:57:20.149 --> 03:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
run in the first time and and try to
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
recruit people and are you going to burn
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
people out maybe that's good and they
 
03:57:26.030 --> 03:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
won't stay around as many terms I don't
 
03:57:28.349 --> 03:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
know it it's just it's just a
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
consideration I'm not sure that I'll
 
03:57:32.110 --> 03:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
vote against it for that reason it's
 
03:57:34.070 --> 03:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
just it's a consideration so so I think
 
03:57:35.910 --> 03:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
to the Chairman's Point most times
 
03:57:37.790 --> 03:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
incumbents don't have a primary right
 
03:57:39.309 --> 03:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
it's the other party that's has a
 
03:57:40.590 --> 03:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
primary because they get more people to
 
03:57:45.309 --> 03:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
jump in um and so um I I to a certain
 
03:57:47.030 --> 03:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
extent I agree with the chairman that I
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
think that you're less likely if you're
 
03:57:50.070 --> 03:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
in office to get a primary and which
 
03:57:51.790 --> 03:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
means that you're not really running a
 
03:57:53.110 --> 03:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
primary race you're just waiting for the
 
03:57:56.030 --> 03:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
general to happen um if you're in office
 
03:57:57.950 --> 03:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
um the people who are not in power in
 
03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
that specific District or seat um is
 
03:58:02.389 --> 03:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
more likely they have a primary more
 
03:58:04.990 --> 03:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
people jumping in so and they're not in
 
03:58:06.349 --> 03:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature so they have plenty of
 
03:58:08.990 --> 03:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
campaign yes I'm sorry when we tried to
 
03:58:14.149 --> 03:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
do this before uh the Secretary of State
 
03:58:16.870 --> 03:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
date was not in favor of a June date is
 
03:58:20.550 --> 03:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
that has that hurdle been uh resolved so
 
03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
I ran this bill by him I I think he's a
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
he's reluctantly okay it's probably the
 
03:58:29.189 --> 03:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
best way I could say it um is that it
 
03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
meets all the requirements and all the
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
deadlines that he'll have it'll actually
 
03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
make it easier for us to get things out
 
03:58:37.429 --> 03:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
like absentee ballots and and um uocava
 
03:58:39.469 --> 03:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
requests right so this will make it
 
03:58:41.110 --> 03:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
actually easier for us to get those out
 
03:58:42.750 --> 03:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
in a more timely fashion for the general
 
03:58:44.950 --> 03:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
November election
 
03:58:47.389 --> 03:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
yes if I recall the secretary's position
 
03:58:50.149 --> 03:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
was to move it back one week yeah which
 
03:58:53.550 --> 03:58:53.560 align:start position:0%
we all had a good laugh at
 
03:58:56.630 --> 03:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
um further questions representative
 
03:58:58.750 --> 03:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
Burnham Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question so in
 
03:59:03.550 --> 03:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
regards to the previous bill that was
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
very similar to this
 
03:59:09.149 --> 03:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
um um one of the concerns was and
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
especially during a presidential year is
 
03:59:15.510 --> 03:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
um you know where our vacation State and
 
03:59:17.670 --> 03:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
that would allow for a lot more
 
03:59:21.030 --> 03:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
publicity and signs and things like that
 
03:59:23.950 --> 03:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
which could be a little nuisance maybe
 
03:59:27.429 --> 03:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
to our visitors um how do you feel about
 
03:59:29.630 --> 03:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
that like that was something that was a
 
03:59:33.030 --> 03:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
concern and is it a good thing or a bad
 
03:59:34.990 --> 03:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
thing so I guess if you consider it this
 
03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
way if you're doing a primary you're
 
03:59:37.870 --> 03:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
gonna have a heck of a lot more signs
 
03:59:40.910 --> 03:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
out um during the primary season um
 
03:59:42.630 --> 03:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
because you have generally so even when
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
I ran from my Senate race I had three
 
03:59:46.110 --> 03:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
three Republicans run against me it was
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
three of us total in the race um so that
 
03:59:49.830 --> 03:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
means there's three signs out during the
 
03:59:52.870 --> 03:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
primary season so by moving it to June
 
03:59:54.070 --> 03:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of those signs would
 
03:59:56.550 --> 03:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
disappear and it would only only be you
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
know the winner signs out from June
 
04:00:01.950 --> 04:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
until a until November um rather than
 
04:00:03.870 --> 04:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple parties so that's
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
number one number two um so the this
 
04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill also came out of conversation with
 
04:00:11.229 --> 04:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
the governor the Governor's in favor of
 
04:00:12.750 --> 04:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
this bill he recently came out in favor
 
04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill and again the reason being
 
04:00:17.910 --> 04:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
is that a July and August date um we
 
04:00:20.229 --> 04:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
have vacations to deal with and so that
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
anything that's in July and August you
 
04:00:23.790 --> 04:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
run against people who are on vacation
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
and less like less likely to be in the
 
04:00:28.630 --> 04:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
community to be able to vote um if we
 
04:00:31.710 --> 04:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
just move it back until August um and so
 
04:00:35.110 --> 04:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
he was in firm um support of a June date
 
04:00:36.750 --> 04:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
because kids are still in school parents
 
04:00:38.349 --> 04:00:38.359 align:start position:0%
are still here they can be engag and
 
04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
then they don't have to deal with it
 
04:00:41.389 --> 04:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
again until November when they when they
 
04:00:41.399 --> 04:00:42.910 align:start position:0%
again until November when they when they
vote

04:00:42.910 --> 04:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:00:42.920 --> 04:00:45.229 align:start position:0%
vote
again

04:00:45.229 --> 04:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:00:45.239 --> 04:00:46.510 align:start position:0%
again
representative

04:00:46.510 --> 04:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:48.870 --> 04:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
Grill yeah twice in one day this is a
 
04:00:50.550 --> 04:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
rare treat was representative Grill
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
rarely rarely joins us in theay chairman
 
04:00:55.790 --> 04:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
of the of the karaoke caucus just so let
 
04:00:57.790 --> 04:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
you know got to got to make time for
 
04:00:57.800 --> 04:00:58.990 align:start position:0%
you know got to got to make time for
Madam

04:00:58.990 --> 04:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
Madam
 
04:01:02.790 --> 04:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
chairman Koke recogniz well I I hate to
 
04:01:04.990 --> 04:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
put another karaoke caucus members bill
 
04:01:06.590 --> 04:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
under some scrutiny I think you guys all
 
04:01:08.269 --> 04:01:08.279 align:start position:0%
know how I feel about a June primary so
 
04:01:11.550 --> 04:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not TR yeah yeah best idea ever love
 
04:01:15.790 --> 04:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
it so much um um so I think one thing
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
that um we love about politics in New
 
04:01:19.349 --> 04:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that for the lower ticket
 
04:01:20.950 --> 04:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
races you know State Rep State Senate
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's more sort of Scrappy down to earth
 
04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
Grassroots and we don't really get those
 
04:01:26.830 --> 04:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
um $100,000 plus campaigns that you'll
 
04:01:29.309 --> 04:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
see in State Rep braces for other states
 
04:01:31.790 --> 04:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
um by moving the primary up I'm
 
04:01:33.950 --> 04:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
concerned that we lose some of that sort
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
of face-to-face appeal and it puts more
 
04:01:37.910 --> 04:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
pressure on candidates as we see
 
04:01:39.349 --> 04:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
increased spending at the upper ticket
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
levels I'm worried that might trickle
 
04:01:42.510 --> 04:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
down to the bottom of the ticket and we
 
04:01:44.590 --> 04:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
might see increased pressure to run more
 
04:01:46.710 --> 04:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
of a professionalized campaign with you
 
04:01:49.550 --> 04:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
know slick uh signs and and palm cards
 
04:01:51.149 --> 04:01:51.159 align:start position:0%
instead of just going out knocking doors
 
04:01:53.469 --> 04:01:53.479 align:start position:0%
checking that box to spend um under $
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
th000 or not check in the box whichever
 
04:01:57.510 --> 04:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know uh whichever ends up being law
 
04:01:59.309 --> 04:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
um so are are you concerned as well
 
04:02:01.269 --> 04:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
about potentially sort of seeing kind of
 
04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
that scope creep with down ballot races
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
and um the impact on kind of our sort of
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
unique political culture thank you for
 
04:02:11.790 --> 04:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
the question so um having having run now
 
04:02:13.990 --> 04:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
a five four five six campaign just for
 
04:02:16.950 --> 04:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
state house whatever it was um I don't
 
04:02:18.590 --> 04:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not concerned about that again I
 
04:02:20.030 --> 04:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
mean I will say that when I came to the
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
Senate I had a really eye opener about
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
how much it costs to run for a senate
 
04:02:26.030 --> 04:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
seat um we're already having $100,000
 
04:02:28.149 --> 04:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
campaigns for for a majority of the
 
04:02:31.550 --> 04:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
Senate seats um over in the Senate um I
 
04:02:33.149 --> 04:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
know over the house there's been a few
 
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
already that have broached 100 Grand in
 
04:02:40.750 --> 04:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
in a race um yeah specials yeah so um so
 
04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
well I don't think this will change that
 
04:02:44.149 --> 04:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
just moving the date I don't think
 
04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
changes it so that it's it becomes a
 
04:02:48.149 --> 04:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
professional race I think the dates the
 
04:02:49.830 --> 04:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
dates the date right so the same thing
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
you would do from June to September
 
04:02:53.550 --> 04:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
you'll just be doing from March March to
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
June so I don't think that changes it at
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
all again I think the best benefit of
 
04:02:59.790 --> 04:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is you get more access to the
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
general voter the voter gets to find out
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
who's my candidates let me go find out
 
04:03:06.070 --> 04:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
about them rather than I'm not sure who
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
my candidates are yet I go to wait till
 
04:03:08.790 --> 04:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
I get through the primary then I can
 
04:03:10.670 --> 04:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
figure out who they are and then I get
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
to go meet with them and I only have 60
 
04:03:14.590 --> 04:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
days for that window of time so I think
 
04:03:17.149 --> 04:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
that this just gives greater access to
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
the voter to the people whose name is
 
04:03:22.590 --> 04:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
November other questions from the
 
04:03:28.790 --> 04:03:28.800 align:start position:0%

time it's just DL yeah okay all right so
 
04:04:01.830 --> 04:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
we have one person signed up who didn't
 
04:04:05.950 --> 04:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
speak who was in support um online why
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
did I come off of that page I don't I
 
04:04:11.550 --> 04:04:11.560 align:start position:0%
don't know why I did that to
 
04:04:23.910 --> 04:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:23.920 --> 04:04:27.189 align:start position:0%
 
380

04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
H oh I see what a weird way of numbering
 
04:04:31.359 --> 04:04:34.550 align:start position:0%
H oh I see what a weird way of numbering
it

04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:34.560 --> 04:04:38.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:04:38.950 --> 04:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:41.550 --> 04:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
huh I'm looking here it's uh it's
 
04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
strange how they've
 
04:04:47.389 --> 04:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
380 there we go it's not in it's in
 
04:04:50.670 --> 04:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
numerical order so it's not like 380
 
04:04:52.830 --> 04:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 380 could be after House
 
04:04:54.830 --> 04:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 379 that's what was confusing me

04:04:58.030 --> 04:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
alphabetical order it was in numerical

order ignoring the first part of it uh
 
04:05:01.550 --> 04:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
online there were three people in
 
04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
support seven opposed zero neutral um no
 
04:05:06.550 --> 04:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony okay with that we're
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%

to verification of the checklist uh the
 
04:16:40.950 --> 04:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
Senate has sent uh daily fette to
 
04:16:44.229 --> 04:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon chairman Barry and members of
 
04:16:47.429 --> 04:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Daley Fett and
 
04:16:49.630 --> 04:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
I am the Senate majority caucus director
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce Senate Bill
 
04:16:53.870 --> 04:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
490 on behalf of Senator avard Senate
 
04:16:55.590 --> 04:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 490 changes the verific
 
04:16:57.149 --> 04:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
verification of the checklist from 10
 
04:16:59.149 --> 04:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
years to five years this bill is a
 
04:17:00.990 --> 04:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
request of Senator aar's constituents
 
04:17:02.349 --> 04:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
that have been monitoring the ver voter
 
04:17:04.590 --> 04:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
checklist in Hollis and by verifying the
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
checklist more often it will be more
 
04:17:07.469 --> 04:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
accurate and will help mitigate the
 
04:17:09.389 --> 04:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
possibility of voter fraud I'm keeping
 
04:17:11.070 --> 04:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
it very brief we have some gentlemen
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%

04:17:33.630 --> 04:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
weie good afternoon Mr chair and
 
04:17:35.389 --> 04:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
esteemed members of the election law
 
04:17:38.189 --> 04:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
04:17:41.469 --> 04:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
Robert warry I'm a representative for
 
04:17:45.149 --> 04:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District District 13 the great
 
04:17:47.469 --> 04:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
town of
 
04:17:50.750 --> 04:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hudson um I have before you
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
a um sort of analysis or if you will a
 
04:17:58.149 --> 04:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
written report um just to cover it
 
04:18:02.349 --> 04:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
briefly um the five as proposed in Sp
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
490 as amended the voter verification is
 
04:18:07.790 --> 04:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
between April 1 and August 1st and
 
04:18:10.349 --> 04:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
fiveyear intervals um with a four-year
 
04:18:11.870 --> 04:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
look back in the four years preceding
 
04:18:15.030 --> 04:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
the year of the verification or
 
04:18:19.790 --> 04:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
Purge I've di I had considered making a
 
04:18:22.870 --> 04:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
mathematical model but uh chose to
 
04:18:24.910 --> 04:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
present this diagram instead because I
 
04:18:26.590 --> 04:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
thought that might be at least a little
 
04:18:29.229 --> 04:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
clearer um you should have a
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
copy there Mr
 
04:18:38.149 --> 04:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:43.590 --> 04:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
this thank you all right so um and part
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
of part of the concern is that there's
 
04:18:47.950 --> 04:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
some variability introduced by having it
 
04:18:50.030 --> 04:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
on a fiveyear cycle since presidential
 
04:18:52.349 --> 04:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
races are on a four-year cycle the
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
potential impact of accurate checklists
 
04:18:57.189 --> 04:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
using a five-year verification interval
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
in order to really understand the impact
 
04:19:01.269 --> 04:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
you have to map it out using a 20-year
 
04:19:03.269 --> 04:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
perspective because it's you you're sort
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
of using the lowest common denominator
 
04:19:07.510 --> 04:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
between fouryear intervals on the
 
04:19:09.189 --> 04:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
presidential races and five-year
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
intervals as proposed in the bill um
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's seems reasonable to assume that an
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
increasing degree of checklist accuracy
 
04:19:21.109 --> 04:19:21.119 align:start position:0%
drift or degradation occurs each year
 
04:19:25.550 --> 04:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
following The Purge this is point two um
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
therefore if if you consider this with a
 
04:19:29.790 --> 04:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
five-year cycle and a four-year look
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
back the accuracy of the checklist will
 
04:19:34.030 --> 04:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
vary across the presidential races as
 
04:19:36.670 --> 04:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
shown in diagram one now what's the
 
04:19:39.309 --> 04:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
concern um because the presidential race
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
is often considered the more important
 
04:19:44.149 --> 04:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
race a potential exists for variable
 
04:19:46.109 --> 04:19:46.119 align:start position:0%
accuracy in the checklist and lower
 
04:19:48.349 --> 04:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
accuracy in four out of the five
 
04:19:50.670 --> 04:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
presidential races occurring in a over a
 
04:19:53.229 --> 04:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
20-year period um because of this
 
04:19:55.149 --> 04:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
variability or inconsistency in
 
04:19:57.189 --> 04:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
checklist accuracy for presidential
 
04:20:02.030 --> 04:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
elections I am uh opposed to sp sp
 
04:20:02.040 --> 04:20:03.630 align:start position:0%
elections I am uh opposed to sp sp
490

04:20:03.630 --> 04:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
490
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
um I say just in the analysis it is
 
04:20:09.630 --> 04:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
worth noting that for fall elections the
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
checklist is most accurate in the year
 
04:20:14.590 --> 04:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
of purges perform and it drifts each
 
04:20:17.309 --> 04:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
successive year until the next Purge is
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
performed so
 
04:20:22.630 --> 04:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
um so I tried to think about this a
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more discreetly and uh I'm
 
04:20:28.830 --> 04:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
moving to two page two now so what is
 
04:20:31.790 --> 04:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
the verification objective obviously we
 
04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
we would like there to be an accurate
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
checklist all the time um uh and I think
 
04:20:40.870 --> 04:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
there's perhaps at least among the
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
voting population less less of a concern
 
04:20:45.630 --> 04:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
for the accuracy of the checklist during
 
04:20:48.510 --> 04:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
the midterm and local elections because
 
04:20:50.710 --> 04:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
there's generally a lower voter turnout
 
04:20:52.229 --> 04:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
during these
 
04:20:55.550 --> 04:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
races um so at least by voter turnout
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
the concern does not appear to be as
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
great for those non-presidential
 
04:21:02.510 --> 04:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
election Cycles so with that
 
04:21:05.070 --> 04:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
consideration perhaps you know what is
 
04:21:07.349 --> 04:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
what is the objective or verification
 
04:21:10.349 --> 04:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
that we're concerned about it's really I
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
think to have the most accurate
 
04:21:15.750 --> 04:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
checklist during the presidential races
 
04:21:18.870 --> 04:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
such an objective was not overtly stated
 
04:21:20.910 --> 04:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
or was at least not considered in the
 
04:21:23.590 --> 04:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
2022 report on this from the special
 
04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee on voter confidence however if
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
you look at the factors of voter
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
interest as identified by voter turnout
 
04:21:32.349 --> 04:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
in presidential elections and based on
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
the demand for integrity in the voting
 
04:21:36.750 --> 04:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
process as expressed in the 2022 report
 
04:21:38.670 --> 04:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
for the special committee on voter
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
confidence this would seem to be the
 
04:21:44.030 --> 04:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
leading and most reasonable objective
 
04:21:47.830 --> 04:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
for accurate checklists and their
 
04:21:50.070 --> 04:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
verification now why why don't we just
 
04:21:52.510 --> 04:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
do this every year then um well I think
 
04:21:55.149 --> 04:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
we have to have some considerations for
 
04:21:57.630 --> 04:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
the supervisor of the checklist
 
04:22:00.750 --> 04:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
workload so generally I think we and
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this before during
 
04:22:04.510 --> 04:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
previous bills generally the increase in
 
04:22:06.189 --> 04:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
the supervisor
 
04:22:08.830 --> 04:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
workload um caused by more frequent
 
04:22:11.070 --> 04:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
checklist verifications is offset by the
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
reduction in the number number of Voters
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
that would have to be removed or
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
processed because of this greater
 
04:22:18.030 --> 04:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
frequency of
 
04:22:20.189 --> 04:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
verification but I think there are still
 
04:22:22.309 --> 04:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
two sort of concerns what is the concern
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
for workload during federal election
 
04:22:28.189 --> 04:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
years um when there's more going on and
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
what is the concern for workload with a
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
more frequent verification interval I
 
04:22:35.830 --> 04:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
think uh The crucial workload question
 
04:22:37.750 --> 04:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
is at what point does the supervisor
 
04:22:40.269 --> 04:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
workload concern outweigh the concern
 
04:22:43.389 --> 04:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
for the accuracy of the checklists
 
04:22:46.469 --> 04:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
that's I just tried to boil it down to
 
04:22:48.790 --> 04:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
what's the kind of logical decision that
 
04:22:52.510 --> 04:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make here so I think
 
04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of different ways of
 
04:22:57.790 --> 04:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
looking at this um if we're trying to
 
04:23:00.550 --> 04:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
meet this objective that I've kind of
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
argued for that we want the most
 
04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
accurate checklist during the
 
04:23:06.269 --> 04:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
presidential races then I think we have
 
04:23:08.590 --> 04:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
and we also want to take into account
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
the concern for supervisor workload then
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
we have potential
 
04:23:17.229 --> 04:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
a few options here so op option one
 
04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
would be a four-year interval in
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
presidential election years if the most
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
accurate checklist is desired in a year
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
of a presidential election and less so
 
04:23:27.790 --> 04:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
for midterms and local elections then
 
04:23:29.469 --> 04:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
the verification process should be
 
04:23:31.750 --> 04:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
performed in the year of a presidential
 
04:23:33.750 --> 04:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
election and it should be performed at a
 
04:23:36.030 --> 04:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
minimum of a four-year
 
04:23:38.990 --> 04:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
interval option two if performing that
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
verification during a presidential
 
04:23:43.070 --> 04:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
election year is deemed to be too
 
04:23:45.710 --> 04:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
burdensome for the supervisor of the
 
04:23:47.950 --> 04:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
checklist then the verification should
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
be performed in the year just prior to
 
04:23:52.109 --> 04:23:52.119 align:start position:0%
the presidential election this was a
 
04:23:54.990 --> 04:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
bill that was uh previously introduced a
 
04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago House Bill
 
04:24:01.790 --> 04:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
1369 um a third option exists and I I
 
04:24:04.070 --> 04:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
think we just have to address it because
 
04:24:05.870 --> 04:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
obviously the most accurate checklist
 
04:24:07.590 --> 04:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
would be obtained by performing the
 
04:24:09.630 --> 04:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
verifications annually or at least every
 
04:24:12.790 --> 04:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
other year um however I think some would
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
consider this to be too frequent of an
 
04:24:17.149 --> 04:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
interval because of the demand on the
 
04:24:20.550 --> 04:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
supervisors so if however if if
 
04:24:21.910 --> 04:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
performing the verification more
 
04:24:24.910 --> 04:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
frequently was not the issue and um but
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
performing the verification during a
 
04:24:28.990 --> 04:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
federal election year whether it be the
 
04:24:31.269 --> 04:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
presidential race or a midterm then the
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
verification could be performed every
 
04:24:34.590 --> 04:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
other year during local election so I
 
04:24:37.389 --> 04:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
think there are ostensively uh three or
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
four options that I think are better and
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
provide more accurate
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
checklists at the time when voters are
 
04:24:47.149 --> 04:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
most concerned about the accuracy of a
 
04:24:49.389 --> 04:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
checklist and that's sort of the end of
 
04:24:51.990 --> 04:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
my analysis and I'm happy to take any
 
04:24:54.750 --> 04:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
questions if there are
 
04:24:56.950 --> 04:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:24:56.960 --> 04:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
representative

04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
Lane that is not my strong point so um
 
04:25:09.630 --> 04:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the diagram yes so is is
 
04:25:13.229 --> 04:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
the problem is that in the fourth year
 
04:25:16.109 --> 04:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
is that because you're doing it in
 
04:25:19.910 --> 04:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
a presidential year but you're not
 
04:25:23.229 --> 04:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
capturing a presidential primary a
 
04:25:25.109 --> 04:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
presidential election is that what
 
04:25:27.590 --> 04:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying yeah so if in the in the
 
04:25:31.109 --> 04:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
diagram uh the smaller box bolded on
 
04:25:33.469 --> 04:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
your left hand in that sort of leftand
 
04:25:36.349 --> 04:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
column would be the year of the purges
 
04:25:38.429 --> 04:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
this is illustrating the
 
04:25:42.429 --> 04:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
fiveyear as proposed in the bill if we
 
04:25:45.269 --> 04:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
assume that there is some sort of
 
04:25:47.309 --> 04:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
degradation of the accuracy of the
 
04:25:50.469 --> 04:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
checklist in each successive year prior
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
to the next Purge then it gets the
 
04:25:57.590 --> 04:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
checklists get worse as you move to the
 
04:25:59.590 --> 04:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
right in the successive
 
04:26:02.910 --> 04:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
years okay and that doesn't obviate the
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist from doing
 
04:26:07.950 --> 04:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
their normal job in removing people but
 
04:26:10.349 --> 04:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
I think we saw in the
 
04:26:14.189 --> 04:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
2021 Purge that that's not always well
 
04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
practiced because we moved a quarter of
 
04:26:18.389 --> 04:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
a million roughly voters from the
 
04:26:22.229 --> 04:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:26.670 --> 04:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:29.109 --> 04:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
so when you
 
04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
say um clean I guess I'm trying the word
 
04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
Purge bothers me because what what
 
04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
happens is is if somebody doesn't if
 
04:26:43.109 --> 04:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
they haven't run you know voted in that
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
time they get kicked off and they don't
 
04:26:48.990 --> 04:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
know that they're kicked off until they
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
show up is that
 
04:26:50.960 --> 04:26:52.870 align:start position:0%
show up is that
correct

04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
well they well I mean the the process is
 
04:26:58.229 --> 04:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
that they would have a letter sent to
 
04:27:00.109 --> 04:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
them they would have you know a time
 
04:27:03.550 --> 04:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
period to respond to that and if somehow
 
04:27:05.149 --> 04:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
they you know life was busy and they
 
04:27:07.510 --> 04:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
didn't actually respond to that letter
 
04:27:09.510 --> 04:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
they could always re-register and of
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
course we um have the capability to
 
04:27:17.149 --> 04:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
register same day as uh needed in this
 
04:27:20.870 --> 04:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
state I think also if um if you listen
 
04:27:24.149 --> 04:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
to the Senate hearing on this bill one
 
04:27:26.030 --> 04:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
of the things that they said is that of
 
04:27:29.469 --> 04:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
the approximately 100% that were
 
04:27:33.229 --> 04:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
removed only five or 6% re-registered so
 
04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's a very small incremental impact on
 
04:27:39.630 --> 04:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
um people who are being removed in in
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
that so I again I I base that solely off
 
04:27:46.109 --> 04:27:46.119 align:start position:0%
of what I heard from the Senate hearing
 
04:27:51.790 --> 04:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:55.149 --> 04:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
analysis sure why not so what would be
 
04:28:02.309 --> 04:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:09.149 --> 04:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question in my in my
 
04:28:14.630 --> 04:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
orig Original House bill I had proposed
 
04:28:16.870 --> 04:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
actually the year before a presidential
 
04:28:20.550 --> 04:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
election I think I think actually the
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
most accurate would be during the year
 
04:28:24.109 --> 04:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
of the presidential election I think
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:30.870 --> 04:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
satisfy the that would I think that
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
would satisfy the voter
 
04:28:35.550 --> 04:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
confidence objective that we're trying
 
04:28:39.550 --> 04:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
to achieve I I am concerned about what
 
04:28:41.389 --> 04:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
impact it would have on the supervisor
 
04:28:43.710 --> 04:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
of check during a federal election year
 
04:28:45.149 --> 04:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
because I think their activities are a
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
little more um I think they're busier
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
and um and and that was why I originally
 
04:28:55.229 --> 04:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
kind of chose oh do it the year before a
 
04:28:57.910 --> 04:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
presidential election in my house bill
 
04:29:00.109 --> 04:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
but I think having kind of done this
 
04:29:02.710 --> 04:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
analysis I think all and all things
 
04:29:04.389 --> 04:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
considered I think I would prefer it in
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:13.750 --> 04:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
um you I also think as we I also think
 
04:29:18.429 --> 04:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
it's important that we make sure we
 
04:29:23.189 --> 04:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
um recognize if there's going to be a
 
04:29:26.229 --> 04:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
workload um impact to the supervisors of
 
04:29:28.990 --> 04:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
the checklist I think for most Wards and
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
towns I don't I don't think it will be
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
huge but obviously there are some areas
 
04:29:35.710 --> 04:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
where it will be and I think that's
 
04:29:38.830 --> 04:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we kind of need to make
 
04:29:40.630 --> 04:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
people aware of and so that they can
 
04:29:43.229 --> 04:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
adequately prepare I think the the good
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
part of that is that you know um
 
04:29:49.550 --> 04:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully we would have a um startup
 
04:29:52.510 --> 04:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
date of of a reasonable time period to
 
04:29:55.149 --> 04:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
give people enough advanced warning to
 
04:29:57.590 --> 04:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
prepare for this in in larger towns
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
where this might have more of an impact
 
04:30:02.550 --> 04:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
I mean Hudson is 10th largest population
 
04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
Center in New Hampshire and therefore I
 
04:30:07.830 --> 04:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
think it you know I'm concerned about it
 
04:30:09.910 --> 04:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
from that perspective
 
04:30:12.189 --> 04:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
so you're welcome further questions from
 
04:30:14.309 --> 04:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
04:30:18.109 --> 04:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
wood Mr chair uh you mentioned that uh
 
04:30:19.510 --> 04:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of time before the
 
04:30:22.149 --> 04:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
presidential elections important but you
 
04:30:24.030 --> 04:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
kind of alluded and I'm just going to
 
04:30:27.469 --> 04:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
for clarity that uh repeating it the
 
04:30:30.550 --> 04:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
same time in a cycle would be also be an
 
04:30:34.189 --> 04:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
advantage too for the way you perceive
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
it you mean in a like a four-year cycle
 
04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
is that what you mean correct yeah I I
 
04:30:41.109 --> 04:30:41.119 align:start position:0%
do think there is an advantage to that
 
04:30:43.309 --> 04:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
because I think
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
again I'm I'm basing my definition of an
 
04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
objective based on voter turnout and
 
04:30:51.189 --> 04:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
because of that I think that's where the
 
04:30:52.830 --> 04:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
most interest lies and that's where
 
04:30:55.429 --> 04:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
voters would like to see that greatest
 
04:30:59.910 --> 04:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh point of accuracy a followup yep so
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
if you picked a down year you can always
 
04:31:04.790 --> 04:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
pick a down Year from what you said is
 
04:31:07.870 --> 04:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
that correct well you a down year as
 
04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
what the um the um checklist people
 
04:31:13.630 --> 04:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
people have to do obviously a
 
04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
non-election year versus a strong
 
04:31:18.109 --> 04:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
election year right yeah you could pick
 
04:31:20.950 --> 04:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
a a local year as opposed to one in
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
which we hold midterms or the
 
04:31:24.670 --> 04:31:24.680 align:start position:0%
presidential races again I think it's
 
04:31:26.349 --> 04:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
it's the key
 
04:31:29.710 --> 04:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
is is is
 
04:31:33.510 --> 04:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
controlling the amount of years where
 
04:31:35.670 --> 04:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
the degradation occurs before that next
 
04:31:35.680 --> 04:31:37.429 align:start position:0%
the degradation occurs before that next
presidential

04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
presidential
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
race last follow up sure
 
04:31:43.590 --> 04:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
so regardless of the math there seems to
 
04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
be a clear from what you're saying is a
 
04:31:48.389 --> 04:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
clear advantage of a the of a four-year
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
cycle and no advantage of a fiveyear
 
04:31:53.950 --> 04:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
cycle I I
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
think if if you look at the diagram I
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
think it kind of
 
04:32:01.590 --> 04:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
outlines you know you're going to get
 
04:32:04.109 --> 04:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
very and again there are some
 
04:32:06.269 --> 04:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
assumptions there's an assumption that
 
04:32:08.750 --> 04:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
the checklist accuracy degradates over
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
that s each successive year and that um
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
therefore you're going to get some
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
variability across a 20year cycle as
 
04:32:25.630 --> 04:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.590 --> 04:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
um these were a lot of the concern or
 
04:32:31.469 --> 04:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that I had when I
 
04:32:34.630 --> 04:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
originally proposed the house bill um I
 
04:32:36.510 --> 04:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
finally sort of figured out a what I
 
04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
hope is a somewhat simple way of
 
04:32:45.990 --> 04:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
sure is there a difference other than
 
04:32:52.670 --> 04:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
the cycle time and amount of time is
 
04:32:54.870 --> 04:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
there a a a big difference between this
 
04:32:58.109 --> 04:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
bill and the house bill in your no in P
 
04:33:01.630 --> 04:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
fundamentally no no I I think it's the
 
04:33:05.189 --> 04:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:09.629 --> 04:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.869 --> 04:33:12.879 align:start position:0%
welcome representative M head is Rec
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
um could could you review what the um
 
04:33:19.070 --> 04:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
criteria is for for um you know
 
04:33:21.709 --> 04:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
receiving a 30-day n letter or or being
 
04:33:24.429 --> 04:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
purged from the list so I think um yeah
 
04:33:27.949 --> 04:33:27.959 align:start position:0%
the RSA talks about you know um
 
04:33:31.269 --> 04:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
different scenarios transfers of you
 
04:33:35.949 --> 04:33:35.959 align:start position:0%
know moving um citizen notification
 
04:33:40.750 --> 04:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
death um other things where someone is
 
04:33:43.029 --> 04:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
uh presumed to be no longer eligible for
 
04:33:46.390 --> 04:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
voting because they basically are no
 
04:33:48.189 --> 04:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
longer in that voting
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
municipality the supervisors of the
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
checklist upon hearing this
 
04:33:55.551 --> 04:33:55.561 align:start position:0%
information um if they can't verify it
 
04:33:58.629 --> 04:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
through other means uh through US post
 
04:34:01.551 --> 04:34:01.561 align:start position:0%
office or uh Secretary of State's office
 
04:34:05.269 --> 04:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
then they send out a registered letter
 
04:34:07.949 --> 04:34:07.959 align:start position:0%
and uh I think it's a registered letter
 
04:34:09.830 --> 04:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
certified letter something like that and
 
04:34:12.349 --> 04:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
they uh then uh
 
04:34:14.590 --> 04:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
have 30-day notification I believe
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's the basic process I'm probably
 
04:34:18.310 --> 04:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
not describing it as accurately as the
 
04:34:21.990 --> 04:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
RSA States it but that's basically
 
04:34:25.789 --> 04:34:25.799 align:start position:0%
it um is this fouryear look back does it
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
look to see who hasn't voted in the past
 
04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
four years and presume that those people
 
04:34:31.310 --> 04:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
haven't voted are are yeah that that's
 
04:34:33.510 --> 04:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
what that that sort of uh arrow pointing
 
04:34:36.070 --> 04:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
to the left it's a look back on the
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
years preceding the per the sorry
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
verification someone doesn't like Purge
 
04:34:44.269 --> 04:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
uh proceeding the verification so it
 
04:34:46.949 --> 04:34:46.959 align:start position:0%
would so if the if the verification were
 
04:34:50.109 --> 04:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
to occur in uh in this diagram if it
 
04:34:53.910 --> 04:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
occurs in 2026 then it looks back uh to
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
January of 2022 so 25 24 23 and 22 and
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
then one last follow please yes um and
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
in the absence of something like Eric
 
04:35:06.150 --> 04:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
which has you know database people have
 
04:35:08.869 --> 04:35:08.879 align:start position:0%
moved and died and so forth uh we're
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
looking to see who's voted who hasn't
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
and I want to ask whether you're
 
04:35:12.670 --> 04:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about the following kind of
 
04:35:16.109 --> 04:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
scenario a very good friend of mine
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
um does not think that politics
 
04:35:21.070 --> 04:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
generally serves her she she's a
 
04:35:25.150 --> 04:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
workingclass person and uh and and she's
 
04:35:27.709 --> 04:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
skeptical of of the whole class of those
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
to serve an office along right and the
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
one of the only candidates she's ever
 
04:35:33.510 --> 04:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
been excited about that I've known is is
 
04:35:36.750 --> 04:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
uh Donald J Trump and when he appeared
 
04:35:38.590 --> 04:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
on the national ballot in 2016 she
 
04:35:40.949 --> 04:35:40.959 align:start position:0%
decided she's going to vote M um she
 
04:35:43.070 --> 04:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
does not vote generally um and voting
 
04:35:44.709 --> 04:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
costs her money because she bills by the
 
04:35:45.910 --> 04:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
hour she's
 
04:35:48.990 --> 04:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
self-employed um I'm really concerned uh
 
04:35:51.390 --> 04:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
that somebody like she will be purged
 
04:35:53.629 --> 04:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
she will not you know respond to a
 
04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
letter she actually has trouble just
 
04:35:58.109 --> 04:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
paying the rent and moves to surp with
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
surprising frequency the letter probably
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
go to one of her previous addresses and
 
04:36:06.310 --> 04:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
this sort of person who you know who who
 
04:36:09.029 --> 04:36:09.039 align:start position:0%
Who's inspired to vote by by very rare
 
04:36:10.670 --> 04:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
candidates who can really appeal to
 
04:36:11.869 --> 04:36:11.879 align:start position:0%
Ordinary People in the way that
 
04:36:14.310 --> 04:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
professional politicians don't will find
 
04:36:16.269 --> 04:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
out on that day when they want to vote
 
04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
for someone like Donald Trump that
 
04:36:19.750 --> 04:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're not on the list are we concerned
 
04:36:22.230 --> 04:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
that this is going to this is going to
 
04:36:24.869 --> 04:36:24.879 align:start position:0%
harm people like citizens like
 
04:36:27.629 --> 04:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
this well I think if they if they move a
 
04:36:29.709 --> 04:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
lot they probably are going to have to
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
fill out an affidavit regardless um so I
 
04:36:35.869 --> 04:36:35.879 align:start position:0%
I think we do have you know same day
 
04:36:40.670 --> 04:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
voter registration so I I think um that
 
04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
ability um alleviates that scenario and
 
04:36:44.561 --> 04:36:45.390 align:start position:0%
ability um alleviates that scenario and
if

04:36:45.390 --> 04:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:36:48.429 --> 04:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
she's uh if your friend
 
04:36:50.949 --> 04:36:50.959 align:start position:0%
is has voted in the previous
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
presidential election for such a
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
candidate and and that candidate runs
 
04:36:57.869 --> 04:36:57.879 align:start position:0%
again well then she would still be
 
04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
eligible of course if she moved she'd
 
04:37:01.590 --> 04:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
have to fill out the necessary paperwork
 
04:37:05.150 --> 04:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
and stuff but but I think those people
 
04:37:07.629 --> 04:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
are not disenfranchised by that
 
04:37:10.510 --> 04:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
situation that you
 
04:37:10.520 --> 04:37:13.429 align:start position:0%
situation that you
described

04:37:13.429 --> 04:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
described
 
04:37:16.109 --> 04:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
ative Hamlet thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:37:17.629 --> 04:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
04:37:21.990 --> 04:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
question um so I'm not so much concerned
 
04:37:24.189 --> 04:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
with the the F five years or four years
 
04:37:26.869 --> 04:37:26.879 align:start position:0%
I have to study the chart but my
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
question is down on
 
04:37:31.390 --> 04:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
line8 this bill is requiring the
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
supervisors to meet at least once a
 
04:37:36.429 --> 04:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
month now in the city of Portsmouth the
 
04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
supervisors do meet once a month but my
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
understanding is that in the very small
 
04:37:44.349 --> 04:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
town they do not need to and they and
 
04:37:46.910 --> 04:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
they don't want to well
 
04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
so Senator fortunately Senator gray is
 
04:37:52.670 --> 04:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
here to answer such questions so you can
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
you can ask him directly okay so um that
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
portion was not mine so I will uh to I
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
will to to be fair representative Hamlet
 
04:38:02.349 --> 04:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
representative where he signed in an
 
04:38:04.510 --> 04:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill so he may not be
 
04:38:06.429 --> 04:38:06.439 align:start position:0%
the one to ask that question
 
04:38:10.310 --> 04:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
to because I I I want the fouryear cycle
 
04:38:13.830 --> 04:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
and under the scenario that I described
 
04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
for the for the reasons I described so
 
04:38:18.510 --> 04:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
just just as a point of clarity just you
 
04:38:21.949 --> 04:38:21.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:25.590 --> 04:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
so all right um yes that's any other
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Wy uh
 
04:38:37.949 --> 04:38:37.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
alucino good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
members thank you so much for uh
 
04:38:45.390 --> 04:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
inviting us and letting us speak um just
 
04:38:48.029 --> 04:38:48.039 align:start position:0%
one quick question to representative or
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Morehead the concern you have about
 
04:38:53.629 --> 04:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
your Donald J Trump voter that already
 
04:38:55.230 --> 04:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
exists because it does happen at the
 
04:38:57.551 --> 04:38:57.561 align:start position:0%
10-year cycle so as the previous
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
gentleman alluded to uh uh the the
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
safety net is is that you go to your new
 
04:39:04.949 --> 04:39:04.959 align:start position:0%
Miss municipality or your current one
 
04:39:06.629 --> 04:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
you present your ID you vote if you
 
04:39:09.990 --> 04:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
don't have your ID you do have the uh
 
04:39:12.551 --> 04:39:12.561 align:start position:0%
affidavit ability anyways I appreciate
 
04:39:15.070 --> 04:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity um we did a deep dive in
 
04:39:17.230 --> 04:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
Hollis over the past three years our
 
04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
findings really reveal a starting real
 
04:39:21.510 --> 04:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
starting reality that one in five to one
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
in four names on our Town's voter roles
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
were just flat out illegitimate as you
 
04:39:29.230 --> 04:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
know the state of New Hampshire's 10year
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
Purge successfully removed an incredible
 
04:39:34.990 --> 04:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
250,000 names considering the state's
 
04:39:37.070 --> 04:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
population of 1.3 million and factoring
 
04:39:39.550 --> 04:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
in a significant portion of aged 17 and
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
under were essentially cleaning up an
 
04:39:43.350 --> 04:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly high percentage of Voters
 
04:39:46.030 --> 04:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
that were on our list Statewide because
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
some cities and towns do a fabulous job
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
this highlights that a substantial level
 
04:39:52.390 --> 04:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
of inaccuracy has been uh across the
 
04:39:55.470 --> 04:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
state's remaining towns exists we must
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
ask why and what can be done to help
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
mitigate and bring better accountability
 
04:40:02.910 --> 04:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
across the board in Hollis alone in 2020
 
04:40:06.150 --> 04:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
our US Census population was 8,342
 
04:40:09.070 --> 04:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
people our supervisor the checklists
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
signed their names to declare that
 
04:40:14.510 --> 04:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 7,700 names were eligible
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
and on our roles this was outrageously
 
04:40:19.110 --> 04:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
high and our voter tally in November
 
04:40:21.230 --> 04:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
2020 was
 
04:40:24.510 --> 04:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
5,890 that produced roughly a 76% voted
 
04:40:26.910 --> 04:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
turnout with the Hollis population of 17
 
04:40:28.590 --> 04:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
and under we knew the voter roles were
 
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
wildly off and we and should have fallen
 
04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
in the range of anywhere from 5700 to
 
04:40:37.350 --> 04:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
6,300 not the 7700 that was declared and
 
04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
signed off on in fact the imminent State
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
Purge called 1390 names to be removed
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
since that happened so close after the
 
04:40:50.030 --> 04:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
10-year Purge and I'm sorry so close to
 
04:40:50.040 --> 04:40:50.708 align:start position:0%
10-year Purge and I'm sorry so close to
the

04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
election um our new number of
 
04:40:58.110 --> 04:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
631 people on our registration list
 
04:41:02.948 --> 04:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
produced an incredible 93% voter turnout
 
04:41:06.868 --> 04:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
upon further investigation we discovered
 
04:41:09.708 --> 04:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
a public list of over 500 names of
 
04:41:12.150 --> 04:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
people on our voter list who either
 
04:41:14.230 --> 04:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
should have not been on the list at all
 
04:41:17.670 --> 04:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
or at least been looked at as they had
 
04:41:19.628 --> 04:41:19.638 align:start position:0%
gone to the post office independently
 
04:41:21.550 --> 04:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
submitting permanent change of address
 
04:41:24.750 --> 04:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
requests not vacation forward my mail
 
04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
but permanent change of address requests
 
04:41:28.788 --> 04:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
after presenting these findings to our
 
04:41:31.948 --> 04:41:31.958 align:start position:0%
local checklist people a cleanup effort
 
04:41:35.708 --> 04:41:35.718 align:start position:0%
um resulting in one in hundreds of names
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
came off our list so looking at those
 
04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
numbers using the same numer Ator of
 
04:41:44.310 --> 04:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
5,890 people voting and then coloring
 
04:41:46.670 --> 04:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
these names now we were looking at 98%
 
04:41:48.628 --> 04:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
possibility of voter turnout that's
 
04:41:48.638 --> 04:41:49.390 align:start position:0%
possibility of voter turnout that's
pretty

04:41:49.390 --> 04:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
04:41:51.750 --> 04:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
incredible additionally over the last
 
04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
few years we've had since that time
 
04:41:57.310 --> 04:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
actually from 2019 through current we've
 
04:41:59.550 --> 04:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
have over 200 new homes built in our
 
04:42:02.190 --> 04:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
town that's the possibility of 200 to
 
04:42:05.350 --> 04:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
400 new registrations of Voters in
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
December 2023 after all the culling and
 
04:42:11.230 --> 04:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
the pushing and cleaning our voter roles
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
were down to
 
04:42:17.270 --> 04:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
606 that's only 116 more people who than
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
who actually voted in
 
04:42:21.150 --> 04:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
2020 now if we go look at the new
 
04:42:23.350 --> 04:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
residents that came in town that are on
 
04:42:26.910 --> 04:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
the December 2023 list that pushes our
 
04:42:30.270 --> 04:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
our number to Just numbers that should
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
at least uh bring about some curiosity
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
to be more uh po forthcoming in
 
04:42:40.270 --> 04:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
addressing accurate voter purges and
 
04:42:40.280 --> 04:42:41.868 align:start position:0%
addressing accurate voter purges and
cleanups

04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
cleanups
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
um it just shows you how important
 
04:42:45.510 --> 04:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
cleaning the voter roles are the
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
checklist people by and large all
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
well-meaning but a little State
 
04:42:52.470 --> 04:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
intervention in terms of uh increasing
 
04:42:54.830 --> 04:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
The Purge would really be a big help and
 
04:42:56.510 --> 04:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
I think actually personally would smooth
 
04:42:58.590 --> 04:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
out their year-to-year
 
04:43:03.270 --> 04:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
duties um let's see here uh we found out
 
04:43:05.230 --> 04:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
in in our particular town that one
 
04:43:08.750 --> 04:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
checklist person stated specifically we
 
04:43:11.190 --> 04:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
refrain from sending out 30-day letters
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
because we know the state will do the
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
work for them this is in the year or two
 
04:43:18.910 --> 04:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
his words leading up to the state Purge
 
04:43:20.948 --> 04:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
so what's happened in this particular
 
04:43:23.470 --> 04:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
case is this particular checklist person
 
04:43:27.150 --> 04:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
in the board was was assuming that the
 
04:43:28.830 --> 04:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
state Purge which is a different
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
criteria than what they do was going to
 
04:43:33.150 --> 04:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
do the work for them so the state
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
intervention of increasing The Purge
 
04:43:36.510 --> 04:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
will actually help mop up a few things
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
where some things might be falling under
 
04:43:38.040 --> 04:43:39.030 align:start position:0%
where some things might be falling under
the

04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:42.430 --> 04:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
radar anyways um one one person from the
 
04:43:43.670 --> 04:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
checklist said we knew we were not
 
04:43:45.390 --> 04:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
sending out 30-day letters on a timely
 
04:43:47.230 --> 04:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
basis we knew the voter roles were
 
04:43:49.230 --> 04:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
overinflated um so as you can see we
 
04:43:51.750 --> 04:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
have the variable aspect of human uh
 
04:43:53.470 --> 04:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
activity affecting the efficacy of our
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
list approval of this measure some form
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
of it will help take the accuracy to a
 
04:44:00.030 --> 04:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
new level in the state and ensure
 
04:44:02.590 --> 04:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
confidence and integrity in the process
 
04:44:03.910 --> 04:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
and help provide a nice check and
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
balance uh without this uh tension of
 
04:44:09.270 --> 04:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
this issue controversy increases in
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
every election and I think the best
 
04:44:12.590 --> 04:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
thing is is just to mop up as much as we
 
04:44:15.190 --> 04:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
can keep things clean so thank you so
 
04:44:16.390 --> 04:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
much will you be taking questions from
 
04:44:17.868 --> 04:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
the committee sure are there questions
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative wood
 
04:44:22.110 --> 04:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:44:24.390 --> 04:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
my question I missed I have a couple of
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions uh but I missed the
 
04:44:27.708 --> 04:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
introduction where you're from I
 
04:44:29.670 --> 04:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
apologize I didn't say it Al fulchino
 
04:44:32.310 --> 04:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
Hollis New Hampshire no okay I did get
 
04:44:35.070 --> 04:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
your name I apologize but the group that
 
04:44:37.230 --> 04:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
put that did this are you a five
 
04:44:39.110 --> 04:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
citizens five citizens there is no
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
Organization no so five citizens five
 
04:44:42.990 --> 04:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
people just
 
04:44:45.708 --> 04:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
literally you had people from both
 
04:44:47.350 --> 04:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
parties in the last few elections saying
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
all the basic stuff he's not my
 
04:44:51.390 --> 04:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
president this election stolen how do
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
you prove these things they can be
 
04:44:57.230 --> 04:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
challenging so the the goal of this was
 
04:44:59.390 --> 04:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
what are the basics we can look at it
 
04:45:01.510 --> 04:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
was very obvious simply by looking at
 
04:45:03.310 --> 04:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
the US Census and the number of people
 
04:45:06.070 --> 04:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
on our roles didn't look right
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when we questioned it in
 
04:45:11.030 --> 04:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
fact what we found was in our town there
 
04:45:13.910 --> 04:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
had been no meeting minutes posted for
 
04:45:15.990 --> 04:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
years now according to the RSA now we're
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
all green to this we just said hey your
 
04:45:19.270 --> 04:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
math don't look right we went privately
 
04:45:21.230 --> 04:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
we even offered volunteerism in our
 
04:45:23.190 --> 04:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
community we found out from the
 
04:45:25.150 --> 04:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office Senator rard
 
04:45:28.270 --> 04:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
other people State reps sheriffs um when
 
04:45:29.830 --> 04:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
I showed them casually here and there I
 
04:45:31.070 --> 04:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
said we don't have mean we can't do the
 
04:45:33.708 --> 04:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
math to figure out where we should be
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
the checklist people in our town
 
04:45:39.670 --> 04:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
rejected outright any um attention to
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
this matter if you go to the Hollis
 
04:45:43.230 --> 04:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
website today you will see the select
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
board has meetings going back like 10
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
years if you go to the checklist you'll
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
see the meetings started in 2022 why
 
04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
because we said
 
04:45:54.750 --> 04:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
hey nobody can do the math there's an
 
04:45:56.670 --> 04:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
RSA that says you you should have
 
04:45:59.230 --> 04:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
minutes we forced it actually we tried
 
04:46:01.310 --> 04:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
three times Mr Bud Fitch and the
 
04:46:02.910 --> 04:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office got involved
 
04:46:06.070 --> 04:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
he contacted them and he said hey guys
 
04:46:08.948 --> 04:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
make minutes okay the first minutes they
 
04:46:11.390 --> 04:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
gave us all had redacted signatures all
 
04:46:13.788 --> 04:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
of their signatures were redacted we
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
said forget that we're not here to crush
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
anybody we only looked at the numbers
 
04:46:19.510 --> 04:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
that our checklist gave us they didn't
 
04:46:23.948 --> 04:46:23.958 align:start position:0%
add up so either a list matters or it
 
04:46:26.190 --> 04:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't either you have a reason to have
 
04:46:29.190 --> 04:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
a list or you don't okay not here to
 
04:46:31.350 --> 04:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
change the world none of us were we just
 
04:46:32.868 --> 04:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
said uh something doesn't look right
 
04:46:35.270 --> 04:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're here to assist and um that was
 
04:46:37.670 --> 04:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
part of the Genesis of uh this whole
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
thing we kept finding things that didn't
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
make any
 
04:46:39.840 --> 04:46:42.270 align:start position:0%
make any
sense

04:46:42.270 --> 04:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:46:45.510 --> 04:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
well if I got your your understanding or
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
your math correctly you started out with
 
04:46:50.590 --> 04:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
about 71% 7700 people the voter turnout
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
in 2020 was we were told was 76% 76 yes
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
and then you went from the first
 
04:46:58.670 --> 04:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
correction so the first correction was
 
04:47:00.590 --> 04:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
the state did their Purge now that
 
04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
happen so close to the election you have
 
04:47:05.910 --> 04:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
to uh recognize there's really only one
 
04:47:08.150 --> 04:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
variable in that three or four month
 
04:47:09.708 --> 04:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
period some people can move in and can
 
04:47:13.628 --> 04:47:13.638 align:start position:0%
move out we had 1390 people come off we
 
04:47:17.470 --> 04:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
did not sell uh you know that many
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
houses and that we we have we're a small
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
town so it stood out in our mind that uh
 
04:47:25.510 --> 04:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
over 10 years why are we not keeping it
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
just a bit cleaner right okay and then
 
04:47:30.150 --> 04:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
the third correction the third
 
04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
correction you instigated your group
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
instigated so what happened was this we
 
04:47:37.830 --> 04:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
wanted the system to work we uh we
 
04:47:39.310 --> 04:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
actually were called by secretary
 
04:47:40.868 --> 04:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
scanlan's office by the Secretary of
 
04:47:42.670 --> 04:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
himself to come up and speak to him he
 
04:47:44.670 --> 04:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
spoke to us for 2 hours he heard enough
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
that said we need to meet again he
 
04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
brought in the Attorney General's office
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
he asked the SEC supervisor the
 
04:47:52.190 --> 04:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
checklist from Halls to come up they
 
04:47:55.390 --> 04:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
didn't show up okay we want to be team
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
players we're very green at this we kept
 
04:48:01.868 --> 04:48:01.878 align:start position:0%
in our back pocket a list of 500 plus
 
04:48:04.470 --> 04:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
names of people who had permanently uh
 
04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
moved moved out of Hall they went to the
 
04:48:08.270 --> 04:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
post office and said I don't live here
 
04:48:09.750 --> 04:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
they signed their name I live in another
 
04:48:11.750 --> 04:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
town in New Hampshire or where the
 
04:48:13.788 --> 04:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
reason we held on to it was we wanted to
 
04:48:16.708 --> 04:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
see the Secretary of State who ended up
 
04:48:18.628 --> 04:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
coming down to the town hall as having a
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
sit down with them do the job here's
 
04:48:22.910 --> 04:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
your training here's your phone numbers
 
04:48:25.390 --> 04:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
here's your websites we didn't see names
 
04:48:25.400 --> 04:48:26.590 align:start position:0%
here's your websites we didn't see names
coming

04:48:26.590 --> 04:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
coming
 
04:48:30.150 --> 04:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
off so we then a gentleman by the name
 
04:48:33.510 --> 04:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
of Mike McCormack and I went into a uh
 
04:48:36.628 --> 04:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
last June or July to the checklist board
 
04:48:38.548 --> 04:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
and we said here's a list of a bunch
 
04:48:41.390 --> 04:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
more names it was over 500
 
04:48:43.590 --> 04:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
their comment was this I guess we're
 
04:48:45.430 --> 04:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to go to the uh select
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
board and get more postage and then the
 
04:48:51.270 --> 04:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
big one for me was one of the checklists
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
person gave to me like the biggest
 
04:48:55.150 --> 04:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
statement I could ever hear in this
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
matter you know Al in the year or two
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
leading up to the state Purge we refrain
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
from sending out 30-day letters because
 
04:49:04.948 --> 04:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
we know the state will do the job for us
 
04:49:07.030 --> 04:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
and at that point I said Tom I know the
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
guy we coached together years ago I said
 
04:49:11.150 --> 04:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
the state has a slightly different
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
criteria than you you have your own
 
04:49:16.030 --> 04:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines they have theirs they don't
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
do the job for you in the same vein that
 
04:49:21.590 --> 04:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
you're alluding to so I said the problem
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
is is when you say you refrain that's an
 
04:49:26.350 --> 04:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
active verb you are saying that one 16
 
04:49:29.070 --> 04:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
to 13d of your term you're refraining
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
from doing your task another checklist
 
04:49:33.868 --> 04:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
person said we knew we were not sending
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
out the 30-day letters on a timely basis
 
04:49:38.430 --> 04:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
now the problem is this creates doubt in
 
04:49:40.830 --> 04:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
anybody's mind who has any logic because
 
04:49:42.030 --> 04:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
now you start to say okay well what's
 
04:49:43.350 --> 04:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
the real
 
04:49:45.230 --> 04:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
numbers okay and if you have to start
 
04:49:46.948 --> 04:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
asking those questions how can you have
 
04:49:49.150 --> 04:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
any belief in the
 
04:49:51.990 --> 04:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
system so they took off a bunch more
 
04:49:56.110 --> 04:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:58.868 --> 04:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
606 are you aware of any other towns
 
04:50:00.190 --> 04:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
with similar
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
problems well as I said to the Secretary
 
04:50:04.470 --> 04:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
of State and I said alluded to here if
 
04:50:07.110 --> 04:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
you have 250,000 names coming off the
 
04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
list and some towns do a fabulous job
 
04:50:11.788 --> 04:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
just look at the percent of the state
 
04:50:15.548 --> 04:50:15.558 align:start position:0%
Purge 3% 5% we ended up being about 22%
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
off so the numbers speak for
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
themselves I can't tell you that there's
 
04:50:23.390 --> 04:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
another town that says we refrain from
 
04:50:25.628 --> 04:50:25.638 align:start position:0%
sending out 30-day letters I I only can
 
04:50:26.788 --> 04:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
tell you our town that's what I
 
04:50:28.510 --> 04:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
witnessed so I'm not here to criticize
 
04:50:30.190 --> 04:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
any other town but the numbers
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that there's not enough
 
04:50:35.150 --> 04:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
cleaning it would be wonderful we lived
 
04:50:37.030 --> 04:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
in an older era where there wasn't so
 
04:50:40.948 --> 04:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
many people moving around and um Trent
 
04:50:43.110 --> 04:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
populations but we live in an era now
 
04:50:45.070 --> 04:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
where hey we have the computers we can
 
04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
do the math we can press the button
 
04:50:48.350 --> 04:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
clean the list we can do the fouryear
 
04:50:50.310 --> 04:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
look backs we can do it more frequently
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
to achieve a better list it just
 
04:50:52.400 --> 04:50:55.350 align:start position:0%
to achieve a better list it just
benefits

04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:55.360 --> 04:50:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
everybody

04:50:57.750 --> 04:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
04:50:59.948 --> 04:50:59.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:51:02.030 --> 04:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure would you object
 
04:51:04.628 --> 04:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
if it if uh right now it states five
 
04:51:07.708 --> 04:51:07.718 align:start position:0%
years if it was four years based off the
 
04:51:09.510 --> 04:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
testimony previous no I wouldn't object
 
04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
at all I think any towards
 
04:51:14.230 --> 04:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
frequency is wonderful I mean our
 
04:51:16.350 --> 04:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
initial submission was two
 
04:51:18.868 --> 04:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
years again um this is something
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
everybody has to coales around I think
 
04:51:22.350 --> 04:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
just generally speaking if we do it more
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
frequently I think we're all winners I
 
04:51:24.718 --> 04:51:25.990 align:start position:0%
frequently I think we're all winners I
really

04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:51:28.110 --> 04:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
do other
 
04:51:30.590 --> 04:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
questions see hearing none thank you uh
 
04:51:32.310 --> 04:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
next up will be Senator
 
04:51:34.430 --> 04:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
gray and uh we're going to do a two for
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
here folks so what's going to happen is
 
04:51:37.150 --> 04:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
I believe Senator G you are testifying
 
04:51:39.190 --> 04:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
on 490 is that correct or am I incorrect
 
04:51:41.030 --> 04:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
on that I'm going to testify both of
 
04:51:42.350 --> 04:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
them if you want yes so what I would
 
04:51:44.310 --> 04:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
like you to do represent uh Senator gray
 
04:51:47.548 --> 04:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
is uh testify on 490 and then I'll
 
04:51:49.948 --> 04:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
recess 490 and allow for the
 
04:51:52.830 --> 04:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
introduction of 5:30 to respect your
 
04:51:55.430 --> 04:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
time uh we will come back to 490 we've
 
04:51:58.390 --> 04:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
done this before folks it's okay um but
 
04:52:01.350 --> 04:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
we want to respect the Senator's
 
04:52:04.548 --> 04:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
time okay so we're doing 5:30 first uh
 
04:52:06.628 --> 04:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
we're doing 490 first you're testifying
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
on 490 and then I'm going to recess 490
 
04:52:12.270 --> 04:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
and then you're going to introduce F uh
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to introduce 5:30 uh after
 
04:52:19.310 --> 04:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
my name is James Gray I'm Senator
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
representing Senate District 6 which
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
starts up in Alton gilon goes down Route
 
04:52:25.110 --> 04:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
11 to
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh the reason I filled out a
 
04:52:29.110 --> 04:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
pink card it sound like you might want
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
to ask me a question or two I am the one
 
04:52:35.590 --> 04:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
who made the final uh draft uh amendment
 
04:52:37.990 --> 04:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
that put the bill into what it is and
 
04:52:41.708 --> 04:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
took it from two years to uh five years
 
04:52:45.510 --> 04:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
Etc uh that was done after uh talking
 
04:52:49.150 --> 04:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State um I don't
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
care what your frequency is uh but
 
04:52:54.708 --> 04:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
remember every time you do one of these
 
04:52:56.910 --> 04:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
the 30-day letters there is an expense
 
04:53:00.350 --> 04:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
to it um so you know when you add up all
 
04:53:03.470 --> 04:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
that postage uh five years seem to be a
 
04:53:07.190 --> 04:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
good compromise uh if you do go to four
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
years you may want to look at looking
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
back either either five or six years to
 
04:53:14.430 --> 04:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
make sure you get two presidential
 
04:53:17.390 --> 04:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
elections one would be the example given
 
04:53:18.990 --> 04:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
that somebody missed a presidential
 
04:53:20.390 --> 04:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
election and that's the only one they
 
04:53:22.910 --> 04:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
vote in they'd have to miss two in a row
 
04:53:24.510 --> 04:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
if you look back six years on a
 
04:53:27.948 --> 04:53:27.958 align:start position:0%
four-year cycle um again that's up to
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
you um the um at least meeting once a
 
04:53:34.830 --> 04:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
month on the
 
04:53:37.390 --> 04:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
supervisors uh if there are changes out
 
04:53:39.430 --> 04:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
there the are supposed to go to the
 
04:53:41.788 --> 04:53:41.798 align:start position:0%
supervisor and you don't want a big
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
delay between the time you identify him
 
04:53:47.350 --> 04:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
and so uh I believe that that came from
 
04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State but don't quote
 
04:53:52.150 --> 04:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
me right now I I I just don't remember
 
04:53:53.910 --> 04:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
when that one came whether it was in the
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
original bill or whether that was a
 
04:53:59.310 --> 04:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
change I made and with that I will
 
04:54:01.230 --> 04:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you have
 
04:54:02.548 --> 04:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:54:04.030 --> 04:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet looks like she
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
want to ask a question you Mr chairman
 
04:54:07.830 --> 04:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator
 
04:54:11.788 --> 04:54:11.798 align:start position:0%
gray so my question is in line eight is
 
04:54:13.708 --> 04:54:13.718 align:start position:0%
do you think it's necessary to require
 
04:54:17.350 --> 04:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
the small towns to for the supervisors
 
04:54:19.628 --> 04:54:19.638 align:start position:0%
to hold meetings every
 
04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
month I think that uh if there is
 
04:54:25.310 --> 04:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
pending things that they're supposed to
 
04:54:27.990 --> 04:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
be reviewing uh certainly the secretary
 
04:54:31.230 --> 04:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
of state is sending out uh death notices
 
04:54:34.990 --> 04:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
from various uh newspaper and from the
 
04:54:38.190 --> 04:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
the system uh they are also reviewing
 
04:54:40.070 --> 04:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
the permanent change of address stuff
 
04:54:42.750 --> 04:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
from the post office that all goes in
 
04:54:46.628 --> 04:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
there uh I would find it you know even
 
04:54:48.750 --> 04:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
well the very small ones I mean you're
 
04:54:50.510 --> 04:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
not going to have a whole lot of
 
04:54:53.070 --> 04:54:53.080 align:start position:0%
Supervisors that have to meet anyway but
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
but you know those are the reasons that
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
I would see that it would be needed uh
 
04:55:01.350 --> 04:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
you may in there if uh uh you know the
 
04:55:04.070 --> 04:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
supervisors will meet you know if it's
 
04:55:06.150 --> 04:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
within so much of an election because
 
04:55:08.430 --> 04:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
you do want new voters to be able to
 
04:55:10.670 --> 04:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
come in and meet with you and and you
 
04:55:12.270 --> 04:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
may want to put in there that they have
 
04:55:16.070 --> 04:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
to meet once a month if uh uh there's
 
04:55:18.390 --> 04:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
pending actions identified in the datab
 
04:55:21.510 --> 04:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
base and stuff you know so again
 
04:55:24.270 --> 04:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
I I would just assume leave it the way
 
04:55:28.750 --> 04:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
it is I mean uh but you know that's up
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
to you guys but there there usually is
 
04:55:35.270 --> 04:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
changes that that have to be made so
 
04:55:38.070 --> 04:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:40.990 --> 04:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
you from the committee
 
04:55:42.910 --> 04:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
hearing none I'm going to thank you
 
04:55:45.310 --> 04:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
Senator gray I'm going to recess the
 
04:55:47.230 --> 04:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
public hearing on 490 we are coming back
 
04:55:49.868 --> 04:55:49.878 align:start position:0%
to it um going to open up the public
 
04:55:52.430 --> 04:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate bill 530 relative to
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
reports of receipts and expenditures
 
04:55:55.590 --> 04:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
filed by political Committees of
 
04:55:57.830 --> 04:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
candidates and candidates and Senator
 
04:55:59.830 --> 04:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
gray is recognized for the purpose of
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill uh thank you my
 
04:56:06.510 --> 04:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
name is uh James Gray I represent Senate
 
04:56:08.788 --> 04:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
District Six which starts up in Alton
 
04:56:11.230 --> 04:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
gilmon comes down rout 11 the
 
04:56:14.910 --> 04:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh this is a rewrite of a bill
 
04:56:18.750 --> 04:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
that uh your chair and I have discussed
 
04:56:23.350 --> 04:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
several times uh this uh talks about
 
04:56:27.830 --> 04:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
sizes of fonts and other things um the
 
04:56:29.788 --> 04:56:29.798 align:start position:0%
discussion that we had way back when is
 
04:56:32.548 --> 04:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
he wanted a 14p point font and I was
 
04:56:34.310 --> 04:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable with an eight because it was
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
going to be in a PDF file or whatever
 
04:56:38.750 --> 04:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
and all I had to do was you know Mouse
 
04:56:40.628 --> 04:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
over it or spread my fingers depending
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
on whether I had a touchcreen or not uh
 
04:56:46.430 --> 04:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
but it really does get down to that uh a
 
04:56:50.230 --> 04:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
lot of people who file paper and fact
 
04:56:52.910 --> 04:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
simil that into the secretary of state
 
04:56:55.788 --> 04:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
that you cannot read the attachments
 
04:56:56.830 --> 04:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
that there were the amount of
 
04:56:59.030 --> 04:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
information they put in there that the
 
04:57:02.030 --> 04:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
font that they use is so small uh that
 
04:57:04.548 --> 04:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
it ends up being blobs on the piece of
 
04:57:07.628 --> 04:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
paper uh when one of my Senate opponents
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
did that I went and
 
04:57:13.230 --> 04:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
demanded of him to give me a a readable
 
04:57:15.868 --> 04:57:15.878 align:start position:0%
copy of it and he kind of laughed and
 
04:57:17.708 --> 04:57:17.718 align:start position:0%
says hey you know there's nothing that
 
04:57:20.150 --> 04:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
says I couldn't do it so I did it you
 
04:57:22.470 --> 04:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
know and uh that wasn't a real good
 
04:57:25.070 --> 04:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
answer to me but you know that's the way
 
04:57:28.830 --> 04:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
it was so uh this we did take out uh at
 
04:57:30.868 --> 04:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
the request of the Secretary of State
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to send these things in on
 
04:57:36.830 --> 04:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
facts uh so if they are sending them
 
04:57:40.390 --> 04:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
in if they are sending them in um you
 
04:57:43.190 --> 04:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
know in a PDF format or other acceptable
 
04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
format to the Secretary of State uh it
 
04:57:48.350 --> 04:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
will be expandable so that the amount of
 
04:57:52.510 --> 04:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
the font becomes more moot than uh and
 
04:57:55.310 --> 04:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to answer any questions you
 
04:57:57.990 --> 04:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
have other questions from the
 
04:58:02.190 --> 04:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane it it's
 
04:58:05.150 --> 04:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat related um because we just
 
04:58:07.590 --> 04:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
finished working on a campaign finance
 
04:58:10.910 --> 04:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
bill where we actually want to require
 
04:58:14.110 --> 04:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
people to use the the campaign Finance
 
04:58:16.470 --> 04:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
system and a lot of that stuff that you
 
04:58:18.750 --> 04:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
put into yours is in another Senate bill
 
04:58:22.628 --> 04:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
that's coming to you Okie doie so we
 
04:58:25.830 --> 04:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
were hoping and then use the and phase
 
04:58:29.430 --> 04:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
it in so that it so that it doesn't all
 
04:58:31.548 --> 04:58:31.558 align:start position:0%
I believe that the basis of the bill
 
04:58:35.628 --> 04:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
that I wrote uh was the a copy that both
 
04:58:39.670 --> 04:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
you and Aaron right had worked on and I
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
was able to redraft that you know making
 
04:58:45.150 --> 04:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
some of those changes that the Senate
 
04:58:48.390 --> 04:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
always does as you know uh and uh that
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
should be coming over to you because I
 
04:58:52.830 --> 04:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
believe it's uh already through the
 
04:58:55.230 --> 04:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
Senate they're faster than we are we're
 
04:58:57.750 --> 04:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
still drafting further I don't get paid
 
04:58:59.868 --> 04:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
anymore though further questions from
 
04:58:59.878 --> 04:59:00.670 align:start position:0%
anymore though further questions from
the

04:59:00.670 --> 04:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:59:02.910 --> 04:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
committee um along those lines as you
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
know Senator we are working on um our
 
04:59:10.150 --> 04:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
house bill is 1091 just so you know um
 
04:59:11.948 --> 04:59:11.958 align:start position:0%
and we are going through the entire
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
section of
 
04:59:18.910 --> 04:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
664 um trying to streamline it um make
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
it more understandable um any objections
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
to us working your concerns into here
 
04:59:24.600 --> 04:59:25.750 align:start position:0%
to us working your concerns into here
into

04:59:25.750 --> 04:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:59:25.760 --> 04:59:27.590 align:start position:0%
into
1091

04:59:27.590 --> 04:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
1091
 
04:59:31.350 --> 04:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
um the only thing that uh that I would
 
04:59:34.548 --> 04:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
object to um is that the secretary state
 
04:59:36.910 --> 04:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
does want to get this one through uh
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
that the fax machine problem is
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
is the reason why most of the stuff that
 
04:59:47.230 --> 04:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
comes in that it's put up on the online
 
04:59:49.788 --> 04:59:49.798 align:start position:0%
is not readable and this not only takes
 
04:59:51.470 --> 04:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
care of the fax machines but it also
 
04:59:55.030 --> 04:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
gives them the right to uh to reject
 
04:59:57.030 --> 04:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
stuff and say they you have to give me a
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
better copy uh so that would be the only
 
05:00:02.510 --> 05:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
thing uh if it's in both you certainly
 
05:00:04.270 --> 05:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
know that we can deal with it in the
 
05:00:07.350 --> 05:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
wherever representative Lane thank you
 
05:00:13.750 --> 05:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so I noticed
 
05:00:15.948 --> 05:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
that this only applies to a political
 
05:00:18.390 --> 05:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
Committee of a candidate or a candidate
 
05:00:20.628 --> 05:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
is there any reason you would not apply
 
05:00:22.470 --> 05:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
this to all political
 
05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
committees um if you look at your
 
05:00:29.510 --> 05:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
draft I think we're going to get down to
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
candidates and political committees and
 
05:00:34.230 --> 05:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have candidates
 
05:00:37.190 --> 05:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
candidate committees you know so I think
 
05:00:39.750 --> 05:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
we're getting down lower I'd have to go
 
05:00:42.430 --> 05:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
back back and review that to exact you
 
05:00:45.628 --> 05:00:45.638 align:start position:0%
know why I worded it the way I did uh
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
but you know it is we are attempting to
 
05:00:49.628 --> 05:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
make it
 
05:00:52.750 --> 05:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
consistent um like I say one of the
 
05:00:56.670 --> 05:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
things that that your notes did was take
 
05:00:58.430 --> 05:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
instead of candidate and candidate
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee there is candidate committee
 
05:01:03.948 --> 05:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
okay and then when you get to the other
 
05:01:08.910 --> 05:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
ones uh there is consolidation also
 
05:01:08.920 --> 05:01:10.868 align:start position:0%
ones uh there is consolidation also
so

05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
other questions from the Committee
 
05:01:15.230 --> 05:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
hearing none thank you Senator I'm going
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
to recess the public hearing on Senate
 
05:01:20.750 --> 05:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
bill 530 we're going to reopen the
 
05:01:24.310 --> 05:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill 490 um Mr
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
next up is Anthony Stan
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
nizzy yes you have no idea how many
 
05:01:32.430 --> 05:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
names have been butchered from this
 
05:01:35.868 --> 05:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
chair so I got it right I'm very happy
 
05:01:37.190 --> 05:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
um this is the last pink card I have for
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
this one representative can you grab the
 
05:01:40.948 --> 05:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
blue sheet for me do appreciate you
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
getting my name somewhat correct I've
 
05:01:46.310 --> 05:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
heard it a lot of different
 
05:01:49.510 --> 05:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
ways uh first of all uh thank you very
 
05:01:51.708 --> 05:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
much I appreciate being here the
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with all the
 
05:01:57.030 --> 05:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
representatives and representative Barry
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to interject something
 
05:02:02.350 --> 05:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
that wasn't mentioned as everyone spoke
 
05:02:04.190 --> 05:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh because there is concerns that we
 
05:02:04.200 --> 05:02:05.070 align:start position:0%
uh because there is concerns that we
don't

05:02:05.070 --> 05:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:02:07.708 --> 05:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise any voter that would like
 
05:02:10.590 --> 05:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
to vote and able to vote and that sort
 
05:02:12.470 --> 05:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
but uh no one ever mentioned the town
 
05:02:16.270 --> 05:02:16.280 align:start position:0%
clerk the town clerk is an active member
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
in working with the the supervisors of
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
the checklist with
 
05:02:27.270 --> 05:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
registering potential voters um change
 
05:02:29.830 --> 05:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
of address information whatever they
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
they they they do act in a role there
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
and can provide uh checklist to the
 
05:02:38.548 --> 05:02:38.558 align:start position:0%
general public that's an RSA as well so
 
05:02:41.230 --> 05:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities for people that
 
05:02:44.350 --> 05:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
want to vote to vote to contact the town
 
05:02:47.548 --> 05:02:47.558 align:start position:0%
clerk if the if the secretaries of the
 
05:02:50.670 --> 05:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
checklist on actively having a meeting
 
05:02:53.190 --> 05:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
and also meetings can be conducted by
 
05:02:58.628 --> 05:02:58.638 align:start position:0%
zoom and uh they can't I Okay the reason
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
I said that is because Board of
 
05:03:03.510 --> 05:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
Selectmen often have members uh zoom
 
05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
into the meetings and kind of that way
 
05:03:09.470 --> 05:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
but I apologize for that statement um
 
05:03:13.868 --> 05:03:13.878 align:start position:0%
anyway just to move ahead um I've had a
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
lot of experience in the healthcare
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
industry so I kind of think along those
 
05:03:20.590 --> 05:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
lines when I think of things that aren't
 
05:03:22.830 --> 05:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
quite right I've had both on the
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
provider side in healthc care and I
 
05:03:28.190 --> 05:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
worked in Industry uh as well in a lot
 
05:03:31.390 --> 05:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
of areas in analytics and so on just to
 
05:03:34.430 --> 05:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh round that statement out um the
 
05:03:37.470 --> 05:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
10-year Purge versus a two-year Purge uh
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
the major points I want to address is
 
05:03:43.470 --> 05:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
inflation voter roles Statewide it's not
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
just a town issue when you look at the
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
250,000 names that are purged and then
 
05:03:51.350 --> 05:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
you start looking at other information
 
05:03:54.750 --> 05:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh and this was in 2020 there were uh
 
05:03:54.760 --> 05:03:56.430 align:start position:0%
uh and this was in 2020 there were uh
1,1

05:03:56.430 --> 05:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
1,1
 
05:04:00.990 --> 05:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
19,23 to registered voters uh with
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
75,6 611 registered same day voters when
 
05:04:07.628 --> 05:04:07.638 align:start position:0%
you look at that and then you look at
 
05:04:10.548 --> 05:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
the US population Center
 
05:04:12.708 --> 05:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire was
 
05:04:16.548 --> 05:04:16.558 align:start position:0%
1399 million so it's almost 1.4 million
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
that if you look in at the underage
 
05:04:23.350 --> 05:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
under 18 years of age resulted in 18% of
 
05:04:25.990 --> 05:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
the population then you start looking at
 
05:04:27.750 --> 05:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
it and saying what are the el el
 
05:04:31.390 --> 05:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
eligible voters that was 1.48
 
05:04:34.390 --> 05:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
million and in order to get to the
 
05:04:37.270 --> 05:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
numbers of actual voters you'd have to
 
05:04:37.280 --> 05:04:38.390 align:start position:0%
numbers of actual voters you'd have to
have

05:04:38.390 --> 05:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
97% of the eligible population to vote
 
05:04:44.788 --> 05:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
to get to those numbers when I always
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
look at um numbers if the numbers are
 
05:04:50.590 --> 05:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
too hot to believe don't believe them so
 
05:04:52.510 --> 05:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
there's some reason there why the
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
inflation is taking place the
 
05:04:57.868 --> 05:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
overinflated numbers and why they're not
 
05:05:00.670 --> 05:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
purged on a regular basis I mean once
 
05:05:02.830 --> 05:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
you start purging on a regular basis
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's like a self-cleaning process that
 
05:05:07.788 --> 05:05:07.798 align:start position:0%
as you go along it gets better and
 
05:05:10.350 --> 05:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
better and the task gets easy are and
 
05:05:15.070 --> 05:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
easier and um as Al mentioned you listen
 
05:05:17.390 --> 05:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
to all those statistics and then you
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
look at the town of haris it is no
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
different than the rest of the state and
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
I can tell you I looked at 234 towns I
 
05:05:27.750 --> 05:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
went on their websites I looked at what
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
they were doing as much as I could find
 
05:05:32.310 --> 05:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
out and you have a very small percentage
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
in 100% compliance it's about
 
05:05:37.948 --> 05:05:37.958 align:start position:0%
34% so looking at the information you
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
have to start drawing questions
 
05:05:41.708 --> 05:05:41.718 align:start position:0%
and then you have to end up getting at
 
05:05:43.470 --> 05:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
the result the more we look at it the
 
05:05:46.030 --> 05:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
more people look at it the better it
 
05:05:49.390 --> 05:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
gets and easier to stay up on things
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
than to catch
 
05:05:54.110 --> 05:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
up and once you start looking at these
 
05:05:58.350 --> 05:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
things all of these issues result in a
 
05:06:02.948 --> 05:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
potential for fraud
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
nefarious there are people out there
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
that would just ass soon do those things
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that they are I don't
 
05:06:11.150 --> 05:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
know if they are it's near impossible to
 
05:06:13.510 --> 05:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
prove but you want to close the doors
 
05:06:18.110 --> 05:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
and elimate those areas of opportunity
 
05:06:19.548 --> 05:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
to do things that they shouldn't be
 
05:06:21.470 --> 05:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
doing but I can tell you when you start
 
05:06:24.708 --> 05:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
looking at the numbers it's it's it's
 
05:06:26.708 --> 05:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
questionable you really want to clean
 
05:06:28.708 --> 05:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
things up and you don't really want to
 
05:06:33.788 --> 05:06:33.798 align:start position:0%
find that you know in New Hampshire with
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
the first anation primary we should be
 
05:06:39.708 --> 05:06:39.718 align:start position:0%
setting example for every other state we
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
should be proud and transparent what we
 
05:06:45.510 --> 05:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
do when I look at the
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
numbers I have to look at it and say
 
05:06:50.030 --> 05:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
they're unbelievable in kind of relating
 
05:06:52.270 --> 05:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
to medical terms you would say they're
 
05:06:57.270 --> 05:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
morbidly obese numbers just for thought
 
05:07:00.430 --> 05:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
process um there two major problems I'm
 
05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
on the second major problem major
 
05:07:06.190 --> 05:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
problem is having a higher uh trangent
 
05:07:08.628 --> 05:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
population and I have some data that I
 
05:07:11.708 --> 05:07:11.718 align:start position:0%
looked at in Hollis that really point
 
05:07:14.030 --> 05:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
out some pretty substantial points of
 
05:07:16.430 --> 05:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
interest and when you look at the census
 
05:07:18.270 --> 05:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
and you look at some of the statistics
 
05:07:22.110 --> 05:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
of the number of multiple family houses
 
05:07:24.590 --> 05:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
rental units in New Hampshire it's
 
05:07:27.470 --> 05:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial and it's hard to
 
05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
differentiate that from all of the
 
05:07:32.708 --> 05:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
cottages and people living on camps and
 
05:07:34.910 --> 05:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
lakes and things like that but it's
 
05:07:37.310 --> 05:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
growing and this is this the a growth
 
05:07:40.830 --> 05:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
over the past few years from 202 1 uh to
 
05:07:47.990 --> 05:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
about 2023 it grew about by 35% uh up to
 
05:07:48.000 --> 05:07:49.590 align:start position:0%
about 2023 it grew about by 35% uh up to
35%

05:07:49.590 --> 05:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
35%
 
05:07:55.830 --> 05:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.190 --> 05:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
here yeah the number of family units are
 
05:08:03.548 --> 05:08:03.558 align:start position:0%
uh 689 th000 rental units in the state
 
05:08:05.830 --> 05:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
and that's going to increase because of
 
05:08:07.948 --> 05:08:07.958 align:start position:0%
high density housing and so on and that
 
05:08:11.350 --> 05:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
lends itself to a Trent population and
 
05:08:14.430 --> 05:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
um having the checkl list purged every
 
05:08:17.590 --> 05:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
10 years does not help that matter at
 
05:08:21.230 --> 05:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
all it produces the opportunity for
 
05:08:25.310 --> 05:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
fraud as I stated I took a look
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
randomly of four different houses in
 
05:08:31.708 --> 05:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
Hollis I don't know who lived there I
 
05:08:33.470 --> 05:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
knew where the addresses were but I
 
05:08:34.830 --> 05:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't even tell you what the houses
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
looked like and if you look at a
 
05:08:40.628 --> 05:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
person's name and I got the name from
 
05:08:44.110 --> 05:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
the the voter list and I picked names
 
05:08:47.590 --> 05:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
like Bon because it's very common
 
05:08:49.788 --> 05:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
particularly in New Hampshire there lots
 
05:08:52.430 --> 05:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
of them but when you look at it and you
 
05:08:54.628 --> 05:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
you pull an address as I did with these
 
05:08:56.830 --> 05:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
four you see the one name that you
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
should and you know that that one name
 
05:09:02.150 --> 05:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
lives at that address but then if you
 
05:09:04.990 --> 05:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
look at the address and look at how many
 
05:09:07.708 --> 05:09:07.718 align:start position:0%
other names there you find an abundance
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
in four names I found 16 errors I didn't
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
look at 10 names and call it down to the
 
05:09:16.670 --> 05:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
names that that were problemsome I just
 
05:09:20.190 --> 05:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
picked them and I in one particular
 
05:09:24.830 --> 05:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
house it was on um Silver Lake Road very
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
very busy street small house the
 
05:09:30.830 --> 05:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
driveway couldn't fit two cars you can't
 
05:09:33.230 --> 05:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
park on the street there and you look at
 
05:09:35.868 --> 05:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
it and pick out one name you see a small
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
house cuz I went on Google Maps and
 
05:09:39.590 --> 05:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
looked at the house and I found that
 
05:09:41.430 --> 05:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
there were I think it was six different
 
05:09:44.430 --> 05:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
people living there with about I think
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
it was uh five different Sur names so
 
05:09:52.670 --> 05:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
you can see that there is an inflated
 
05:09:55.470 --> 05:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
and you know why it's because they're
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
not being purged I'm not saying there's
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
anything nefarious going on but you
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
can't have that in that
 
05:10:06.708 --> 05:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
people believe in the product that we're
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
producing which is a clean voting list
 
05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
so what I'm asking for is that um we
 
05:10:15.990 --> 05:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
look at the problem we know it exists
 
05:10:18.350 --> 05:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
and now it's time to fix the problem
 
05:10:22.110 --> 05:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
because I relate to again if any one of
 
05:10:26.030 --> 05:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
us were Mor morly obese we'd want to go
 
05:10:28.750 --> 05:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
on a diet now we don't want to go on a
 
05:10:31.628 --> 05:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
diet in 2027 we want to start fixing the
 
05:10:33.910 --> 05:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
problem immediately the sooner we can
 
05:10:36.548 --> 05:10:36.558 align:start position:0%
fix it the better off it'll be the more
 
05:10:38.868 --> 05:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
transparent let anyone see the
 
05:10:38.878 --> 05:10:39.868 align:start position:0%
transparent let anyone see the
information

05:10:39.868 --> 05:10:39.878 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
at any time and then we can hang our hat
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
on and say have with it go
 
05:10:49.948 --> 05:10:49.958 align:start position:0%
look minimal changes should be seen once
 
05:10:52.070 --> 05:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
you clean it like I say it's easier to
 
05:10:55.310 --> 05:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
keep it up than it is to catch up I
 
05:10:57.230 --> 05:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
think I'll end on that point I had
 
05:10:58.750 --> 05:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
submitted information you can look at
 
05:11:02.110 --> 05:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
all my documentation and I'll be very
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:09.990 --> 05:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
have questions from the committee
 
05:11:13.070 --> 05:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
seeing hearing none the thank you so
 
05:11:15.070 --> 05:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
much I don't have any other pink cards
 
05:11:17.670 --> 05:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
we had one person signed up who didn't
 
05:11:19.708 --> 05:11:19.718 align:start position:0%
speak in support by the way it was the
 
05:11:23.430 --> 05:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office
 
05:11:27.270 --> 05:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
um and online I don't know why I keep
 
05:11:30.190 --> 05:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
closing the online because I have to
 
05:11:30.200 --> 05:11:38.190 align:start position:0%
closing the online because I have to
read

05:11:38.190 --> 05:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:38.200 --> 05:11:54.350 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:11:54.350 --> 05:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:56.990 --> 05:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
05:11:59.470 --> 05:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
490 now we get to do the weird lookup
 
05:12:01.628 --> 05:12:01.638 align:start position:0%
here we go all right online there were
 
05:12:03.670 --> 05:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
eight in support five in opposition no
 
05:12:05.070 --> 05:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
neutral with that I'm going to close the
 
05:12:07.190 --> 05:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate bill4 490 I'm
 
05:12:09.150 --> 05:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
going to reopen the public hearing on
 
05:12:11.270 --> 05:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 530 relative to reports of
 
05:12:12.788 --> 05:12:12.798 align:start position:0%

05:12:19.840 --> 05:12:22.230 align:start position:0%
candidates um only one pink card left

Olivia zinc executive director of open
 
05:12:35.868 --> 05:12:35.878 align:start position:0%
democracy and I live in Franklin and we
 
05:12:37.628 --> 05:12:37.638 align:start position:0%
do need to reduce the influence of money
 
05:12:40.390 --> 05:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
and politics and increase the voices of
 
05:12:42.548 --> 05:12:42.558 align:start position:0%
average everyday Citizen and this bill
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
provides accountability and transparency
 
05:12:48.110 --> 05:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
following the December six campaign
 
05:12:51.750 --> 05:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
Finance reports um it is more clear than
 
05:12:54.750 --> 05:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
ever that we need um urgent
 
05:12:57.750 --> 05:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
reform um I took a look at two
 
05:13:00.070 --> 05:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
governatori candidates so both the
 
05:13:03.670 --> 05:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
friends of Cindy warmington report and
 
05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
um the friends of Chuck moris report I'm
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
just going to hold it up so you can see
 
05:13:10.638 --> 05:13:11.750 align:start position:0%
just going to hold it up so you can see
the

05:13:11.750 --> 05:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:16.750 --> 05:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
data I mean you need a magnifying glass
 
05:13:19.350 --> 05:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's um some of them are upside down
 
05:13:21.628 --> 05:13:21.638 align:start position:0%
they're not even like right side up so
 
05:13:23.628 --> 05:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
you have to flip them over and upside
 
05:13:23.638 --> 05:13:25.230 align:start position:0%
you have to flip them over and upside
down

05:13:25.230 --> 05:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:13:28.708 --> 05:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
um so I did take two screenshots due to
 
05:13:31.230 --> 05:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
the small font on two of the two of the
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
reports that were just filed on December
 
05:13:35.910 --> 05:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
6 of
 
05:13:38.548 --> 05:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
2023 the legislator has a chance to make
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
sure that campaign Finance reports are
 
05:13:42.670 --> 05:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
leg legible so that transparency is
 
05:13:44.548 --> 05:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
critical for
 
05:13:48.190 --> 05:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
voters um I also want to say that you
 
05:13:51.590 --> 05:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
could make this bill stronger
 
05:13:56.030 --> 05:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
on lines three and four and
 
05:13:58.670 --> 05:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
18 it is just limited to political
 
05:14:02.070 --> 05:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
Committees of of a candidate and
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
candidates I um think that this should
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
be uh the leg uh making sure that
 
05:14:11.590 --> 05:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
legible reports should be everyone who
 
05:14:15.230 --> 05:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
files a report not just two classes of
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
who file a report make them everybody
 
05:14:21.628 --> 05:14:21.638 align:start position:0%
um and I know that this committee is
 
05:14:24.510 --> 05:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
looking at moving to the online filing
 
05:14:27.150 --> 05:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
which I think solves the font size
 
05:14:31.310 --> 05:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
problem completely so if you do that um
 
05:14:34.628 --> 05:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
um but I do urge you to ought to pass
 
05:14:36.910 --> 05:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
before the you know urgently because
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
then this could fix it for this election
 
05:14:41.948 --> 05:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
cuz I know those reforms of online
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
system will not happen until following
 
05:14:46.628 --> 05:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
elections happy to take any questions
 
05:14:48.190 --> 05:14:48.200 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the
 
05:14:50.510 --> 05:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee do we do you feel that eighto
 
05:14:53.548 --> 05:14:53.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:55.628 --> 05:14:55.638 align:start position:0%
sufficient could I sorry I couldn't help
 
05:14:57.708 --> 05:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
myself don't I couldn't help myself I
 
05:14:59.150 --> 05:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
could I had to do it I had to do it I
 
05:15:01.150 --> 05:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
mean the question is I don't know what
 
05:15:03.390 --> 05:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
what size font this is it looks like
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
eight font to me uh I also think this is
 
05:15:09.590 --> 05:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
smaller this might be 4 point
 
05:15:11.788 --> 05:15:11.798 align:start position:0%
f um I just think they need to be
 
05:15:14.788 --> 05:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
legible and so I think that the the you
 
05:15:17.708 --> 05:15:17.718 align:start position:0%
know what the point font is it's up
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's your committee decision but I do
 
05:15:21.708 --> 05:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
think voters need to be able to read
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
these and not have a magnifying glass in
 
05:15:25.788 --> 05:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
order to read these the point of the
 
05:15:28.750 --> 05:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
these reports are for
 
05:15:31.150 --> 05:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
transparency and people putting them in
 
05:15:33.990 --> 05:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
such small fonts um make it so that you
 
05:15:36.628 --> 05:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
can't read them and one of them is faxed
 
05:15:38.670 --> 05:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
so this is not only just whatever size
 
05:15:40.750 --> 05:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
font this is but then it's faxed on top
 
05:15:44.430 --> 05:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
of it so it's even harder to re read
 
05:15:46.788 --> 05:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
it fax in that 8 point font you know
 
05:15:49.350 --> 05:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
what I mean um all right no other
 
05:15:51.390 --> 05:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
05:15:53.708 --> 05:15:53.718 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Z and thank you for allowing me to
 
05:15:57.030 --> 05:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
get my my uh font joke in I had to do it
 
05:15:59.310 --> 05:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
I did do the full committee reports that
 
05:16:01.670 --> 05:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
I gave to the clerk if anyone wants to
 
05:16:03.628 --> 05:16:03.638 align:start position:0%
see the full committee reports instead
 
05:16:06.510 --> 05:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
of just the um screenshots I took what I
 
05:16:09.150 --> 05:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
find interesting though is the
 
05:16:11.430 --> 05:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
expenditure Parts they made larger than
 
05:16:15.470 --> 05:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
the campaign donations so um they
 
05:16:18.430 --> 05:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
definitely um looks great I what to talk
 
05:16:21.990 --> 05:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
about what's the issue here um thank uh
 
05:16:24.070 --> 05:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
we had two people signed up on the blue
 
05:16:26.628 --> 05:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
sheet who didn't speak um one of which
 
05:16:28.190 --> 05:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
was the Secretary of State's office
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
online there were four in support zero
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
opposed that that's our last hearing for
 
05:16:36.030 --> 05:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
today thank you to the committee um try
 
05:16:37.590 --> 05:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
to get me those reports by the end of
 
05:16:39.270 --> 05:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
the day otherwise I'll start writing
 
05:16:42.110 --> 05:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
them um I did get yours and 344 has
 
05:16:44.190 --> 05:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
already been sent in um so I'm very
 
05:16:45.868 --> 05:16:45.878 align:start position:0%
proud of myself on that and I will see
 
05:17:07.830 --> 05:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
