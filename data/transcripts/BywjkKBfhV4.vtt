foreign

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay people told me i wasn't going to
 
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
have a rowdy crowd this morning so i

didn't bring my gavel
 
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
if i need it i know exactly where it is
 
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.030 align:start position:0%
if i need it i know exactly where it is
okay

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.430 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
first up is 1624
 
00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
relative to students with disabilities
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
participating in co-curricular
 
00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.589 align:start position:0%
participating in co-curricular
activities

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
and making an appropriation
 
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
so it looks like you just want to talk
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
to him
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'm representative tim lang i represent
 
00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 align:start position:0%
belknap for the towns of tilton and
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
samerton i'm currently the chairman of
 
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
the house fish and game committee and i
 
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
also serve on ways and means so my
 
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
testimonies made really fast because
 
00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
ways and means is meeting right now
 
00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.190 align:start position:0%
ways and means is meeting right now
um

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
so i introduced house bill 1624. this is
 
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
a pretty straightforward bill it was
 
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
originally introduced by representative
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
michael moffatt
 
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
two terms ago
 
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
three terms ago
 
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
and what the bill does is it basically
 
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
just creates a fifty thousand dollar
 
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
grant program under the department of
 
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.550 align:start position:0%
grant program under the department of
education

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
and that 50 000 dollar grant program a
 
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
year will be used for
 
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.470 align:start position:0%
year will be used for
schools

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
that want to create unified um
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities and if you're
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
not familiar with the unified
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities it's
 
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 align:start position:0%
the most common example is in sports
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
programs where they'll have a a soccer
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
team or a basketball team that will be a
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
mixture uh generally a 50 50 or 60 40
 
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
type mixture of special needs kids with
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
neural typical kids
 
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
so that they can work together and learn
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
how that that works
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
um if you've never attended one of those
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
programs it's probably the most
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
uplifting program i've ever attended i
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
got invited out by special olympics to
 
00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
one out in convale out in conval
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
and i could not
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
i cannot uh say how uplifting it was to
 
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.830 align:start position:0%
i cannot uh say how uplifting it was to
watch

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
watch
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
the entire school body watch this
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
basketball game between the kids
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
and and what it does
 
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
now that being all said i'm also
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
a little practical about this
 
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
i served for six years on my school
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
board in five years on my school budget
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee and i know that one of the
 
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.670 align:start position:0%
committee and i know that one of the
most

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
challenging things to do is get a new
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
program off the ground
 
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
especially in our tightening budgets
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
and so the goal of this bill is to pay
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
for that startup cost for lack of a
 
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
better phrase right it's about startup
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
costs it allows this grant program would
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
be applied for equipment costs so again
 
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 align:start position:0%
i'll stick to things like soccer and
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
basketball um in the case of us they
 
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
need to buy uniforms they need to buy
 
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
medical equipment for the tr for to have
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
that have it on the side of the field
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
when the team's playing
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
um there's uniforms as ball you know
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
soccer balls nets if they need it for
 
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
for setting it up so again the idea
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
behind this program is to offset
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
just the equipment costs
 
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the first year of the program the
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
school is still going to be on the hook
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
for something so they got to pay the
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
stipend to the teacher or the or the
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
administrator i didn't want to do a bait
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
and switch it's one of the things i
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
hated most when i was on the school
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
board was hey we got a federal grant for
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
that two years later the federal grant
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
went away
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
right now all of a sudden you're stuck
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
paying a full position or a full
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
something so this is about having
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
everybody having a little piece of skin
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
in the game
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
and that the school board will have to
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
agree to the stipend and that's going to
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
be part of their operating cost but the
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
startup costs that initial 2500 to 5 000
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
it takes just to get the program off the
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
ground could be applied for and paid for
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
by this grant program i will say it's
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
not limited to just sports so we heard i
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
last term i chaired a committee
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
that what discussed the the the
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
things that are inhibiting
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
access to these programs in school
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
districts i currently don't have it
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
money was the number one thing was we
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
just on the money to start up programs
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
but one of the things we heard in that
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
committee was actually one of the school
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
districts does a unifor a unified
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
theater arts program where they
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
literally put on plays with kids that
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
are special needs so it's not just
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
limited to sports it's limited to the
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
entire range of what goes on in the
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
school system and where there are limits
 
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.990 align:start position:0%
school system and where there are limits
um

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
but again i i i think these programs are
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
extremely worthwhile if there's anything
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
that makes a better human being is
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
watching one of these programs or
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
participating my daughter participated
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
in it when she was a senior at
 
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.510 align:start position:0%
in it when she was a senior at
winnisquam

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
winnisquam
 
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.309 align:start position:0%
winnisquam
and

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
again it's the most uplifting and best
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
thing we can do to create
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
just good human beings in our school
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
system that understand
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
the differences between everybody i'll
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions again in the
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
second year there is a provision in the
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill for the second year money um or the
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
money that's not spent for the second
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
year and that is to allow
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
school systems that have if if there's
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
money left over after schools apply for
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
the grant
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
and we don't spend it all for startup
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
costs then any leftover money can be
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
used by schools that have programs that
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
need to replace equipment because
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
they've had them for the equip the
 
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
programs for so long that you know they
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
need new soccer balls they need new
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
uniforms so
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
again it does never exceeds the 50 000
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
per year but if there's money left over
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's allowed to be applied for by
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
schools that have existing programs to
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
replace existing equipment again i'll
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
call it the startup cost those
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
replacement costs to keep that down
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
in all cases the school's responsible
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
for the labor side of this whole
 
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.350 align:start position:0%
for the labor side of this whole
conversation

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
and that's it are there any questions
 
00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:06.710 align:start position:0%
and that's it are there any questions
yes

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
reps of the heath thank you
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question so if
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
i understand this correct correctly
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
um we would allocate fifty thousand
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
dollars per year
 
00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
for first-time expenses for a school
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
district so they only would be eligible
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
for one grant
 
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.869 align:start position:0%
for one grant
um

00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
i guess that's my primary question
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
because i do completely support this and
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
i agree i love these kind of it's just
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
perfect so to be clear just so i i i'm
 
00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:38.550 align:start position:0%
perfect so to be clear just so i i i'm
not

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
to be clear would be it'd be one grant
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
per one program yes so if they wanted to
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
do a theater arts and a soccer program
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
they could put two different grants over
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
those two because they're two different
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
unified co-curricular programs and they
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
could have a grant put in for both if
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
they were trying to ramp it up so man
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'm cheer yes
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
so that means if um i
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
am in manchester and we decided we
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to do a theater program at
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
central high school we could apply for
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
that and we could also do a soccer
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
program and we could do an act after
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
school basketball program
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
um so it would work like that correct
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
and it'll be up for the department of
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
education to manage those okay grants
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.150 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
yes

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you represent murray sorry
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
just fine um two questions uh you
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
addressed the first one kind of i'd like
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
to just make sure you understand it more
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
um it sounds uh like there are
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
logistical issues in terms of a school
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
not using all the money and it would go
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
back into the state pot or would there
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
be an option for the school to simply
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
keep that money and use it for an
 
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.230 align:start position:0%
keep that money and use it for an
additional

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
co-curricular program this is i'm sorry
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if i was unclear what i meant
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
was for the department of that that was
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
regarding the department of education in
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
the grant so we allot fifty thousand
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
dollars if we only award grants in in
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
the amount of ten for startup programs
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
or we 40 and if for startup programs and
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
there's ten thousand dollars left in the
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
grant program at the doe schools would
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
then be able to apply schools that have
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
existing programs could apply for
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
towards that ten thousand dollars to
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
replace equipment so is that the doe
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
level not at the school level so if the
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
school gets a grant of ten thousand
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
dollars they don't refund the four
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
dollars and fifty cents so they didn't
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
spend and i think you just asked or
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
answered my other question the size of
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
the grants are 10 000.
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
no well again i was going to leave that
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
up for the doe to come and the school
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
could apply for the grants and then the
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
deal we can manage you know
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
so i will tell you that this bill passed
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
for the last three terms as past
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
education unanimously out of education
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
to here um the problem was always i
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
forgot last term when i put this bill in
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
and this committee denied it
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
we uh forgot to put rule making
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
authority and and and explain it out a
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
little bit further so this bill is
 
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
slightly amended from last term um to
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that the division has the
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority to put into all
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations around the
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
grant program that they could do but i
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
forgot to do that last year what's the
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
maximum size the grant that a school
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
could apply for again i didn't put that
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
in the bill because i didn't want to
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
micromanage i wanted to put a the cap
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
amount and then the
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
doe i will tell you if i'm serving on
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
the school board it's anywhere from 20
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
to re depending on the program you do it
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
could be anywhere from 2500 to 3500 for
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
for a sports program
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
they could also put in for a 500 grand
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
just for materials for this for the
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
program so again the amount of the grant
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
is based on what the school need is and
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
they can put it in and then do we can
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
through rules decide whether or not it
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's a very modest size of a
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
there we go sorry about that i have
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
two questions um
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
so am i understanding correctly that the
 
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.430 align:start position:0%
so am i understanding correctly that the
um

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.310 align:start position:0%
um
this

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
what you're anticipating is that these
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
would be new programs for a school
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
district in other words if if a school
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
district has
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term a regular
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
soccer team for example this would be
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
what you're envisioning is that there
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
would be another
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh soccer team that would be composed as
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
you've described is that am i correct in
 
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.310 align:start position:0%
you've described is that am i correct in
it

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
correct so um i again most schools i
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
won't say most schools so i'll use
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
winnisquam as an example because i serve
 
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.949 align:start position:0%
winnisquam as an example because i serve
there

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
we have a regular jv and high school
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
soccer team but we also have a unified
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
sports soccer team which is a third team
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
that is available
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
and and one thing you again if if you
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
think about it this way and i hate to
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
say it this way because it sounds really
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
conceited to a certain extent i guess
 
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.629 align:start position:0%
conceited to a certain extent i guess
but

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know the jv and the soccer teams are
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
the highly competitive students that are
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
that are into athletics and sports right
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
they're a whole nother class of students
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
that enjoy sports but don't get to play
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
sports right because they can't compete
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
at the level of jv and and varsity right
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
so the idea is those students also now
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
have an outlet and can go play on the
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
unified team which is they can have fun
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
they can interact with their students
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
create bonds all the social bonds that
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
happen you know there's a when i served
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
on the school board i read a great study
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
that talked about kids that participate
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
in at least two or more athletic
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
activities have higher grades right and
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
it allows these students to participate
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
in those kind of programs
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
sure okay right you know some may ask
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
one this is a really sort of different
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
question i i think i agree with the
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
other comments this sounds like a great
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
idea my question though is
 
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.269 align:start position:0%
idea my question though is
um

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
why and it was as i understand it and
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
i stand to be corrected but we generally
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
don't appropriate money in the second
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
year of the budget and so i'm wondering
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
you know wouldn't it
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
assuming as i think we all probably do
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
that this is a great idea
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
why do it now as opposed to not next
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
year in the first year of the next
 
00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:44.710 align:start position:0%
year in the first year of the next
budget

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
if you want to change the effective date
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
and so it's effective next budget cycle
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
that'd be fine i i just know that we're
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
delaying the the implementation of the
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
program um part of this is going to have
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
to dhe uh i'm sorry i'm so used to
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
talking to dhhs goe has to um
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
has to put rules together and things
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
behind this so again the longer we push
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
this off and kick this can the later
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
later it's going to be before schools
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
can implement i think that a 50 000 ask
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
is a pretty minimal ask
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
especially coming from my ways and means
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
background i just got my report and we
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
have 173 million dollars in excessive
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
revenue right now and i know uh the
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and i have had this
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
conversation about how much money it
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
really is but um but again you know i
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
think a 50 000 is a minimal ask that
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
that would make this work and allow
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
schools to get get going on these kind
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
of programs great thank you
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
in the legislation you
 
00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.829 align:start position:0%
in the legislation you
say

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
public school districts so this this
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
grant would be for our public school
 
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.550 align:start position:0%
grant would be for our public school
districts

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
who are normally carry these programs
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
all schools that carry these programs
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
that are con considered public schools
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions yes
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
represent murray thank you again just to
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
clarify i'm sorry um
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
the 50 000 stays at doe and when you
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
talk about it being distributed in the
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
next year so and it's we're talking
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
about fifty thousand dollars so it's not
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of money anyway but um so it would
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
not go back into the general fund or
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
money so that they would it's a
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund okay thank you
 
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.710 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund okay thank you
representative

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mada chair thank you
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative lang for your testimony a
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed to having a
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
a dollar limit per grant added into
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
i would not be opposed to it again i'm a
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
pragmatic guy if you tell me that's the
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
only way it's going to pass this
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
committee i'll take that over not
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
passing the bill at all
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
however i would also think that
 
00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:54.949 align:start position:0%
however i would also think that
um

00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
some of this may have to do with um
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
school size right the cost the cost
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
regionally is differently is a little
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
bit different so again i i wouldn't be
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to it if if you want to add that
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
but i'd also like think that yeah we can
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
all we can i serve on jalcar and i can
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
make sure when doa brings these rules
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
forward those kind of limits are put in
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
place as well
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you um
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
and you your response actually brings up
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
my point my
 
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.550 align:start position:0%
my point my
concern

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
not fear but my concern might be that
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
since it is a limited amount of dollars
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
by allowing bigger grants for
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
maybe bigger schools would that possibly
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
knock out the ability for smaller
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
districts to even have access to any of
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
the money sure again i would not be
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
opposed if you wanted to say no grant
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
shall exceed five thousand dollars and
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
put that number down give you ten
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
schools or ten programs that could be
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
started annually if all five all did and
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
yet if the grants are less they could do
 
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.670 align:start position:0%
yet if the grants are less they could do
more

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
one more matter
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
one more
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
all right two one more two three part
 
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.949 align:start position:0%
all right two one more two three part
question

00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:10.949 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
do you have any id how many of these
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
programs exist right now
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
so we
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
we did a survey as part of that
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
commission if i remember right it was
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
about 20 percent of the schools have
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
some sort of form program but a vast
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh i know that we have this program
 
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.470 align:start position:0%
uh i know that we have this program
unified

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%

00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
and i was unable to shepherd this
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
forward last term
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
due to ill health the voters apparently
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
get sick of me but uh i'm back in uh in
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
a big way and and hopefully this is uh
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
this bill it also is back as rips and
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
blank said it's been in the mix and
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
the po and i'll just speak very briefly
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
the policy aspects as representative
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
lang said it's passed uh three times in
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
house education
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
um and and i'm sure
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
you already know that this uh
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
is a way unified sports is a way to
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
integrate uh players who have
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
intellectual challenges into the sports
 
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.710 align:start position:0%
intellectual challenges into the sports
mainstream

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
mainstream
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
and it leads to new friendships improved
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
self-esteem positive changes and
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
attitudes and behaviors increased sports
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
skills a deeper connection to the school
 
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.549 align:start position:0%
skills a deeper connection to the school
uh

00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
children or youngsters who participate
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know in these young athletic
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
programs improve motor skills at twice
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
the rate of
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
youngsters who do not participate and uh
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
82 percent of the family members of
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
unified sports participants in the u.s
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
report that their
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
their kids their athletes improve as
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
they said self-esteem confidence and so
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
these are the policy pieces which which
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're all aware of i know the
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
focus here is on numbers and just a few
 
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
more quick comments uh on the
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
inclusivity which is so important uh
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
improving student fitness social skills
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
emotional skills friendships on and off
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
the field uh which happens in all kinds
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
of sports i'm a sports guy but
 
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.190 align:start position:0%
of sports i'm a sports guy but
especially

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.070 align:start position:0%
especially
for

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
youngsters who maybe aren't as
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
representative language said inherently
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
competitive athletes this is this whole
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
program is a is a mechanism a vehicle
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
to get them to meet people and to
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
integrate and also to to get
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
more fit
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
again a catalyst social inclusion
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
now students with higher skill levels
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
might serve as mentors
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
and this is part of the beauty of the
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
program is that
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
the students who don't have the
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
intellectual challenges so to speak they
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
get to engage and and
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
and get
 
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.310 align:start position:0%
and get
they

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
profit from this too even the students
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
who are not intellectually challenged if
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
i can put it that way you know they
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
benefit from this by learning about how
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
to mentor and and to work with and to
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
have these teammates typically teammates
 
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:13.990 align:start position:0%
have these teammates typically teammates
are

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
of similar aids there's some questions
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
about uh you know if there's an age gap
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
and typically the teams are
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
of similar age
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes they're co-ed
 
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.149 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes they're co-ed
oftentimes

00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
oftentimes
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh and there are highly competitive
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
options as well as non-competitive
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
cooperative type options and
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
but they train in the same team
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
so anyway again this being finance
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee most unified sports teams
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
options are more affordable and i know
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative lang touched on the
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
the the fifty thousand dollars and you
 
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.070 align:start position:0%
the the fifty thousand dollars and you
know

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
he just went back to ways and means and
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
and numbers are his thing as they are
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
so and again last thing i'll just say is
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
it is already been touched on
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
given the
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
the size of the total budget as you know
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
much better than me the the 50 000 is is
 
00:22:05.919 --> 00:22:06.950 align:start position:0%
much better than me the the 50 000 is is
uh

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
we think relatively affordable even in
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
the short term and i know the question
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
came up you know should we push this
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
back here and i just would echo
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative lang's comments about
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
kicking this down the uh again as i said
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
i brought this up two terms ago and and
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's still uh
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
not spinning its wheels it's moving
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
forward here we are but
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh if there's a way to not push this out
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
of here i hope that you can figure out
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
how to do that and again it's not that
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's not like football or ice hockey
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
again you know soccer typically is very
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
soccer is maybe the most
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
popular unified sports option um and
 
00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.510 align:start position:0%
popular unified sports option um and
that's

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
probably the least expensive to
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
implement so anyway
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for hearing my current
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
comments i'll email them to you as well
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions if there
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
are any are there any further questions
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
murray thank you again now you've only
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
referenced sports and in here it says
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities and
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative lang mentioned theater is
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
it your mind that it's only sports or
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
can you give examples because i i think
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
i mean this is a fabulous ideas for me
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
but i would love to see it expanded to
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
include non-sports i don't and you know
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
theater is the one that comes to mind
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
there may be musical groups that you
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
know could also benefit from this but
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
you only talked about sports sure great
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
question and you mentioned co-curricular
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
activities the original intent
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
of this was uh tied into special
 
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.590 align:start position:0%
of this was uh tied into special
olympics

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
olympics
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
which which is athletic but there are
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
some gray areas where some activities
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
are dance for example um is
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
co-curricular and has an athletic
 
00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:50.149 align:start position:0%
co-curricular and has an athletic
component

00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
component
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
some types of dance more than others
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question and
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
again depending on what you do with this
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
when doe finally does the the final
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines if they expand this a little
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
bit to co-curricular activities like you
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned that could
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
include dance or theater
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
or gymnastics uh that type of thing um
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
great question and uh
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
my thought is if if if there's some
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
motor skills whatever movement uh i
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair um
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned
 
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.350 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned
a

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
the word uh the words
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
motor skills involved is that the intent
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the co-curricular out activities
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh i think
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
the the basic intent again is the prime
 
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.110 align:start position:0%
the the basic intent again is the prime
sponsor

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh is twofold it's to
 
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.350 align:start position:0%
uh is twofold it's to
integrate

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
integrate
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's a social component
 
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.950 align:start position:0%
uh there's a social component
integrating

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
integrating
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
different types of students into the
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
same mix into the same team
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh so the social component but as i
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there's certainly a
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
health fitness motor skills uh skill
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
development um component as well so it's
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
twofold as i see it social and mo i say
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
motor or athletic
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
so would it be fair to say
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's not your intent that this would
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
apply to say a math club
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
or a chess club or
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
something along that lines sure great
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
question it kind of goes along with
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative murray's question uh
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
could it apply to a chess club
 
00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:46.070 align:start position:0%
could it apply to a chess club
i

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
i think that the the rules that
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately are formalized and sent out
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
to around the state to the districts um
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
would be somewhat at the discretion of
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
of d.o.e department of education
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
and that's a great question because i'm
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
sure that'll come up
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
some will say what about my dance club
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
what about the chess club
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
is chess
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
chess is fairly sedentary compared to
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
most other things but
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
if if you're able to find the 50 000 i
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
rules could be
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
put out there that would i would prefer
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
to see a bigger tent or umbrella that
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know dance gymnastics even chess
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
i guess sure
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's in my view you know
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
i do okay
 
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.789 align:start position:0%
i do okay
um

00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
i didn't see if you were the prime or
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
you are on it um
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
i should ask representative lang the
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
same question would you be opposed to a
 
00:26:47.679 --> 00:26:49.190 align:start position:0%
same question would you be opposed to a
um

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
a wording in there
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
something to the effect of a unified
 
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.310 align:start position:0%
something to the effect of a unified
co-curricular

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
co-curricular
 
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
activities with an athletic or some some
 
00:26:57.679 --> 00:26:58.710 align:start position:0%
activities with an athletic or some some
uh

00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
physical component to it i'm just
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
the reason i ask i'm a little hesitant
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
to just send it off and let
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
the rules committee uh
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
the department or whoever make the rules
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden we have
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
something that maybe wasn't
 
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.990 align:start position:0%
something that maybe wasn't
sure

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
uh yeah representative lang is the prime
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor but have obviously i have a
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
little ownership because i was the
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
original prime sponsor so
 
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.149 align:start position:0%
original prime sponsor so
uh

00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:24.159 --> 00:27:25.669 align:start position:0%
uh
yes

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
another good question and uh i
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
understand what your point is you know
 
00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:31.350 align:start position:0%
understand what your point is you know
you

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
are a little concerned about doing it
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
possibly uh
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know coming up with some guidelines
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
or some prescriptive wording that might
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
not be in sync with where you all are at
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
so my my response would be that uh as
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
you own the measure now
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
you could
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
amend it in terms of the wording to
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
broaden it or limit it
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
in such fashion as you think best
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
that would hopefully move something
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
forward in the shorter term rather than
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone good morning uh
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is sue mullen and
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
i represent the people of hillsboro 7
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
the town of bedford
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
i have provided testimony for the record
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
that i've just given to representative
 
00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:28.549 align:start position:0%
that i've just given to representative
murray

00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
murray
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
which i will briefly touch upon because
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
the gentleman prior
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
said a lot of what i had intended to
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
share with you
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
probably the thing that i can give you
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh the most this morning
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
is actual experience in uh being
 
00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:46.870 align:start position:0%
is actual experience in uh being
involved

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.669 align:start position:0%
involved
in

00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
both special olympics and the unified
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
sports program i was in public education
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
for 39 years
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
during that time 10 of those years i was
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
the co-director of the special olympics
 
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
bedford has a community service
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
component to its high school diploma so
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
you have to get so many volunteer hours
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh in order to graduate
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
special olympics and unified sports have
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
been a huge draw for typical peers
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
to interface with their disabled excuse
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
me counterparts
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
because the message that we're
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
delivering is that community service
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to hurt
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
that you can take something that you
 
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.950 align:start position:0%
that you can take something that you
love

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
love
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
like athletics like the theater
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
and you can contribute to your community
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
through volunteerism
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
with your disabled peers who are also
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
interested in the same topics but may
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
need support around the activity in
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
order for them to participate
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
the startup costs are going to be
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
relatively small because when you start
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
a program and again uh as the co-founder
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
of the special olympics program in
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
bedford we literally started with a
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
handful of kids and a few
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
community based volunteers
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that program in the first year so it
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
was a question of
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
equipment uniforms and transportation
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
for that program because
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
once you
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
have a team right you want to go out and
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
play other people and in order to get
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
them there we had to rent buses
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
so that was the kind of cost that we
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
incurred but the program was small
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
these uh grants would
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
are not in perpetuity
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
as the community becomes invested in the
 
00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:47.590 align:start position:0%
as the community becomes invested in the
program

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
our experience was that we had
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that couldn't wait to get in
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
line to help support our programs and
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
that they were more than willing to
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
donate people and
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
resources so i don't think you're going
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
to be on the hook for much after
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
the community realizes
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
how successful these programs can be
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
unlike representative moffett i will
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
tell you i am a co-sponsor on the bill
 
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.950 align:start position:0%
tell you i am a co-sponsor on the bill
um

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know playing the game what do tim
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
lang mike moffatt and sue mullen have in
 
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.230 align:start position:0%
lang mike moffatt and sue mullen have in
common

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
common
 
00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.430 align:start position:0%
common
right

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.389 align:start position:0%
right
this

00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
we have this in common and i do believe
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
that it should be expanded beyond
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
athletics because we have disabled kids
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
who are unable to athletically compete
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
but may in fact want to sing in the
 
00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:37.750 align:start position:0%
but may in fact want to sing in the
chorus

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
chorus
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
kids in the theater program who just
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
like their typical peers they're just
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
not interested in athletics they need
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
the socialization
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
they need the exposure they need the
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
sense of belonging in community that
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
comes with being part of a program or a
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
team but it may not necessarily be
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
basketball or soccer that draws them
 
00:31:59.919 --> 00:32:01.029 align:start position:0%
basketball or soccer that draws them
into

00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
the process and also the volunteers tend
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
to be different
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
the kids that are volunteering in a
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
unified cheerleading program are
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
probably going to be different than the
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
kids that are volunteering in a unified
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
arts program
 
00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:17.190 align:start position:0%
arts program
so

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
i would be happy i can't tell you i
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
some of you know i was
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
here a couple of years ago banging the
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
drum on this as well with
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
my friend tim lang and
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
i i can't tell you how transformative
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
this is for communities
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
and the idea that smaller communities
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
that are struggling financially would be
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
able to get seed money
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
to set these things up
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
i think it is hugely important
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
being involved in special olympics was
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
life-altering for me
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
and i would love to be able to bring
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
that to
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
disabled kids as well as their typical
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
peers and i'm happy to take any
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
questions that anybody has
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
all right let's see oh
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
i asked a question
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
and i guess i should i should have i
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
should have asked this question earlier
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
and i i just didn't think of it but let
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
me ask you guys
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
as i said before this seems to me to be
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
a great idea
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
my my only question is
 
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.310 align:start position:0%
my my only question is
um

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
as i understand the way the the proposed
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill is drafted it would apply
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
sort of across the board in other words
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
the department of education could make
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
these grants to any school district and
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm i guess i'm wondering
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
should there be some
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
should we be focusing this more on
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
school districts that you know face a
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
monetary challenge in other words it
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
frank candidly it would seem to me that
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
you know if we if we had to list school
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
districts that would
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
the district that i come from wyndham
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
and the district that you come from
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
bedford are probably not going to be
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know are not going to face much of a
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
challenge to fund this on their own
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
whereas there may be other school
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
districts that would face a much greater
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
challenge so should we limit it in some
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
way it's a i certainly understand your
 
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.590 align:start position:0%
way it's a i certainly understand your
question

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
i will tell you as somebody who was uh
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know at the rotary club with my
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
handout at the men's club with my hand
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
out that i had uh
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
i had a huge challenge in bedford new
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire initially coming up with the
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
funding for the program because this our
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
school district had nothing to do with
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
funding us
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
their in-kind donation was allowing us
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
to use the facilities
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
so when we played basketball we had a
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
dedicated time when the gym belonged to
 
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.990 align:start position:0%
dedicated time when the gym belonged to
us

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
but as far as getting the buses to take
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
us to keene to play in the tournament in
 
00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:46.310 align:start position:0%
us to keene to play in the tournament in
march

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
or uh the overnight
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
expenses to go to the summer games in
 
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.750 align:start position:0%
expenses to go to the summer games in
durham

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
durham
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
all of those things had to be raised by
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
the local programs and they were not
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
funded by the school district so
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
um i i would hate to i would hate to
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
make for you to make the assumption that
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
just because the school district is more
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
flush that they would have greater
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
access to this
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
you know i mean the reality is that it
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what school district
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
you're in those kids that are uh
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
not the squeaky wheels
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
the ones that are not up for division
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
one scholarships
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
are not typically the kids that are at
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
the top of the list for financing
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
alternative programs
 
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.109 align:start position:0%
alternative programs
so

00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
all right i'd love no because
 
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.630 align:start position:0%
all right i'd love no because
yeah

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
we are running um
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
over time so it's a quick one thank you
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.710 align:start position:0%
madam chair
um

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
in your testimony a couple seconds ago
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the word
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
buses and transportation it's my
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that this
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
bill would not
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
would assume that it would not but it is
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
an expense so what i m what i was saying
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
to you was that
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
as teams are setting themselves up
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
even someplace like windham or bedford
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
is going to have to come up with money
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
for transportation
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
even if it wasn't coming out of this
 
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.829 align:start position:0%
even if it wasn't coming out of this
grant

00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
the way the the way the bill is
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
structured it is limited to
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
uniforms and equipment and that's why i
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
asked them yes and that's period end of
 
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.710 align:start position:0%
asked them yes and that's period end of
sentence

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
on that yeah my only my only
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
clarification was that that doesn't mean
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
that the expense doesn't exist it just
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
means it's not funded through through
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
this mechanism
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much you're welcome
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative ladd you would like to
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
quickly i got a book in front of me um i
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
see for the record my name is rick light
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
i chair how said i come from haverhill
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just uh make a point of
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
clarification here years ago
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
when i arrived here from
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
up north
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
we changed the definition of
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
extracurricular to co-curricular
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
and co-curricular has been written into
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
various aspects of statute here
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
you can find it in 193e on 193.1
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
c and also in the compact for
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
children that are from
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
military families but i'm going to read
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
it to you so you really understand that
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
co-curricular shall include those
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
activities which are designed to
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
supplement and enrich regular academic
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
programs of study
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
provide opportunities for social
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
development and encourage participation
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
in clubs
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
athletics performing groups and service
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
to school and community
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
and that's the design that we have
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
within our athletic programs
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
we have feeder programs which are
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
intramurals and then we get to middle
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
school where it's intramural slash
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
athletics and then we get the course the
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
the the sports programs from freshman to
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh to uh
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
jv to varsity in in the high school
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
level but this particular program is a
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
co-curricular program
 
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
and as i see it and as i've always voted
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
for it it would follow this definition
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
yes represent murray
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's a quick question but i it becomes
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
important to me um so when you're
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
reading this this does not specifically
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
reference or include students with
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities but when i'm reading the
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill i got the impression that it was
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
for students with special needs or
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
special disabilities so can i just get
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
clarified on that
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
well we had when we talked about unified
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
sports and we were talking initially
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
about the special olympics is where this
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
all jumped off from but then we saw that
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of students within the
 
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.190 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of students within the
system

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
that by public education that are not
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the co-curricular as
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
we had it spelt out the athletic
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
component the the marching bands the
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
theater all that
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
and we saw a wonderful opportunity here
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
to involve students which had special
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
needs or special
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh areas which
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
not necessarily all special ed and i
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
don't see it that way
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
i see it to any child that needs to have
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
this venue this opportunity to
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
participate uh in
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities i'd caution too
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
to relate this thing to just the wealthy
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
district or the non or and not provide
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
to the non-wealthy i don't want to slide
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
down then we've got a judge sitting in
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
front of us here down the londonderry
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
area where we're only providing support
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
and curricular activities or we have to
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
provide it to all regardless of the
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
wealth of the community or the poverty
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
of the community and when we get into
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
this venue right here we're getting into
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
co-curricular which deals with areas
 
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.589 align:start position:0%
co-curricular which deals with areas
that

00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
i believe that we have to have this
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity provided to all districts
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
not just those which have the money to
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
most of the districts which have the
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
money do it will do it and they probably
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
won't come after a grant
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
but it will be those districts for
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
example like a manchester which has so
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
so huge a number of kids that would be
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
benefiting from this and i i agree with
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt that we need to
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
address this program or design this
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
program to try to
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
adhere to the definition of
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
co-curricular and have it available to
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
all those students and let the local
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
district decide you know in terms of you
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
know where are the students going are
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
they going to go into freshman athletics
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
freshman sports jv sports
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
we oftentimes when i was in charge of an
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
athletic program up in alaska i was very
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
fortunate my athletic travel budget was
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollars
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
but we also had intramural program which
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
went on at noon time for kids that was a
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
co-curricular program it was not a
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
curricular program so how you design
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
this is going to be up to the local
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.069 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
the unified portion is the unity between
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
disabled students and non-disabled
 
00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.510 align:start position:0%
disabled students and non-disabled
students

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
so there's no room in this bill
 
00:41:57.839 --> 00:41:59.349 align:start position:0%
so there's no room in this bill
for

00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning for the record
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
my name is rebecca fernett i'm the state
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
director of special education
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
um we did do a fiscal note for this bill
 
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.910 align:start position:0%
um we did do a fiscal note for this bill
and

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
did not have any issues with the bill we
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
can easily put the requirements of
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing this into the process we
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
already have for reviewing grants
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's a very small portion of money that
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
we are able to handle within what we're
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
already doing the only
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
piece of this that i would say might be
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
a little difficult for us to meet is
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
that effective date of rule making by
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
july 1st of 2022
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
um it just may take us longer to do that
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
but beyond that we have no issues with
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
this bill or um
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
have any we don't have any issues with
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
so what date would you like us to put as
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
the effective date
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
i would turn around and ask diana fenton
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
because she was the one that said
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:30.309 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
come up and join my friend becky here um
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
so for the record
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
and an attorney for the department of ed
 
00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:36.950 align:start position:0%
and an attorney for the department of ed
um

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
we have to just be aware that this
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
effective date july 1st
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
2022 for the department to enact our
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
rules by that date
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
we would probably be unable to do that
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
so if you envision that this bill would
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
be signed into law
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
april or may maybe even june to put the
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
department on that schedule would be
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
difficult so
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
the department would request
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
maybe a september date
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
in division two anything is possible
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
but i don't know if that would conflict
 
00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:17.910 align:start position:0%
but i don't know if that would conflict
with

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
the intent of the grant so we want to be
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that all the pieces
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
come together but certainly the
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
department can have cannot uh sustain
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
that burden if we have a july 1st
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
effective date with recognizing the
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
passage date that we're going to be
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
so we would just ask that this committee
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
be cognizant okay question does anyone
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
have a problem with changing the
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:53.750 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
and i mean i don't i don't see that as
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
having any real effect on the program
 
00:44:59.599 --> 00:45:00.870 align:start position:0%
having any real effect on the program
um

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know whether
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
whether they uh the schools apply for a
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
grant in september or they apply for a
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
grant in january
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
the key is
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
getting the program uh going
 
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:18.950 align:start position:0%
getting the program uh going
okay

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
if not
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'll close the hearing on
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
whatever work session on
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
sixteen twenty i won't close it i will
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
recess it
 
00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:45.430 align:start position:0%
recess it
until

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
after we hear the non-germaine amendment
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
this afternoon is that enough time
 
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.589 align:start position:0%
this afternoon is that enough time
mickey

00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
mickey
 
00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:52.790 align:start position:0%
mickey
okay

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
we'll recess and if um we run into
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
problems then we'll
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
recess again but
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
when you say enough time you just want
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment with the date change
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
yeah okay i can do that and the only
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
other thing i would suggest doing is on
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
line 11 of the bill
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
it talks about the department shall
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
include in its biennial budget
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds i think perhaps i would
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
recommend changing that to
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
the department's efficiency expenditure
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
request its agency budget request versus
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
a statutory requirement that something
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
be in its budget i think you would want
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
to leave that up to the budget process
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay that's a good idea
 
00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.750 align:start position:0%
okay that's a good idea
yes

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.710 align:start position:0%
we're talking
amendments

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
i i would really like to see a dollar
 
00:46:43.599 --> 00:46:45.270 align:start position:0%
i i would really like to see a dollar
limitation

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
limitation
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what that number is but
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
that way we don't have a single
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
district getting 25 000 and then
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
some others
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's a number that can be changed in
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
the future i don't know what that number
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
is she left
 
00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.430 align:start position:0%
is she left
yeah

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
my only concern is if we have
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
10 schools or 20 schools apply or
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
whatever i don't want to leave that
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
limitation up to the
 
00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:22.950 align:start position:0%
limitation up to the
room

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
doe making the rules i would prefer us
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
to set that initial limit if it doesn't
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
work out in the future we can always
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair i wouldn't be opposed to
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
i would think um
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
based on what i heard each
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
each district could apply for a new
 
00:47:45.119 --> 00:47:46.470 align:start position:0%
each district could apply for a new
program

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
so um i think between five and ten
 
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.309 align:start position:0%
so um i think between five and ten
thousand

00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
oh that's way too high you think way too
 
00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:53.510 align:start position:0%
oh that's way too high you think way too
high

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
high
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
i would not be opposed to that
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
i think some place not more than like 4
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
000 would cover i was thinking 2500 to 5
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that range so does 4 000
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
work that would work for me
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay is that
 
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.470 align:start position:0%
okay is that
what

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.309 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
no what uh what we're uh we're
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
discussing is that um
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
you don't have to take your code off
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
we're we'll be okay
 
00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.430 align:start position:0%
we're we'll be okay
yeah

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
representative uh turcotte has suggested
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
that we set a
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
a dollar limit
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
per grand
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
and um obviously we know not a lot about
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
these programs but
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
we were
 
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.030 align:start position:0%
we were
thinking

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
the number that
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
represent turcotte has said is someplace
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
between 25
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
and five
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
and i said four
 
00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:56.950 align:start position:0%
and i said four
so

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
what the schools might
 
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.069 align:start position:0%
what the schools might
need

00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
you go ahead i don't care who i don't
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
what kind of uh
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
demand do you believe we'll see for this
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
no idea
 
00:49:29.359 --> 00:49:32.549 align:start position:0%
no idea
i

00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
my only concern when you left the room
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
was i i don't want some schools being
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
shut out because others have already
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
come in and taken up all the money right
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
so i honestly have no idea what the
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
demand would be this is not something we
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
have done through my office um but i
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
think that we could go into rulemaking
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
where we say that we would take all of
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
the applications and then determine how
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
much each school would get to try to
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
maximize the amount of schools that get
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
some money so it may be that they don't
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
get the 4 000 but maybe they get 2 000
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
so that more schools can get a little
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
bit of money we could we could we'll
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
make that way to say that
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
um so that we're giving as many schools
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
as possible the opportunity i think it's
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
it's also and just for the record diana
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
fenton uh with the department of ed
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
i closed this hearing you you you just
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
that was just a teaser really closely
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
here okay um it's still open i think
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
when we when we look at this program and
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
we've had conversations with the
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
sponsors about this that uh the
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
department would
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
base its rule making structure the rule
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
making similar to what we did with the
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
robotics grant back in
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago years here but 2018
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
2019 it's before the pandemic so
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
everything in my life now is before the
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic or after the pandemic or during
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
the robotics rules which is a very
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
similar program
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
was before the pandemic and we created
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
that that rule structure and i think if
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
we look at the language of that bill and
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
the subsequent rules it's going to give
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
us a really nice framework for how the
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
department will implement this program
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest the language be
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
structured as to you know not to exceed
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
whatever amount this committee decides
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
no more than correct and then that gives
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
the department some areas that we can
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
work on and we can ask in our
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
application for some more details of
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
what their program will encompass and so
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
i think that addresses your concern
 
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.109 align:start position:0%
i think that addresses your concern
that

00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
all districts will have an opportunity
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
that we're not providing money that
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
might not be necessary it will be based
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
on what each individual district
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
requests so a soccer program
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
i don't play soccer i don't know that
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
might be a different cost than a theater
 
00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:46.630 align:start position:0%
might be a different cost than a theater
program

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
right so i think we have to
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
have it be have the opportunity to
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
individually tailor it for each district
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
and what their need is
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome okay can i recess
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
the hearing now
 
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:01.030 align:start position:0%
may i'm sorry to extend this
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:02.630 align:start position:0%
may i'm sorry to extend this
[Laughter]

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
is your intent to limit the up to or no
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
more than four thousand dollars per
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
program or per district yeah because you
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
may have a district to apply for
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
multiple programs
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay close uh if you're gonna talk
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
you gotta try i'd say uh per program
 
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.950 align:start position:0%
you gotta try i'd say uh per program
okay

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to the department to
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
have those pieces in the law which will
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
then subsequently govern our rulemaking
 
00:52:27.839 --> 00:52:28.950 align:start position:0%
then subsequently govern our rulemaking
okay

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
well i i did not open the other hearing
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a work session so
 
00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.670 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a work session so
okay

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.710 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
so now we've got this for this afternoon
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
let's see i've got too many pieces of
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
paper here
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
this is the work session on
 
00:53:07.839 --> 00:53:12.470 align:start position:0%
this is the work session on
1627

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
do we have an amendment on this mickey
 
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.470 align:start position:0%
do we have an amendment on this mickey
or

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
this is a non-germaine amendment you
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
attached yeah we should have one yeah i
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
relative to the direct certification
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
for the medicaid information for free
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%

eight
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
seven five okay
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:05.119 --> 00:54:08.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on the
 
00:54:12.559 --> 00:54:14.390 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on the
amendment

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
i think we're i think we're all in
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
agreement that um
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
we want to establish the program
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
administrator i don't think that was the
 
00:54:23.119 --> 00:54:25.270 align:start position:0%
administrator i don't think that was the
question

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
but are there any questions on zero
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
eight seven five that i've probably
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
washed out of my brain but
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead um madam chair i think we have
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
a couple of people in the audience that
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
would like to talk to the amendment
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
um ladies if you'd be so kind if that's
 
00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:43.670 align:start position:0%
um ladies if you'd be so kind if that's
okay

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
i didn't i didn't realize there were
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
people here
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i'm jessica
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
goran with new i'm the deputy director
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire hunger solutions
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.839 --> 00:55:09.150 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
g-o-r-h-a-n as a nancy
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
um today
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hunger solutions is here
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
to speak on behalf of medicaid direct
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
certification it is good for new
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire children and schools
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
medicaid direct certification means that
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
children already receiving medicaid and
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
whose family's income is below 130
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
percent of the federal poverty level
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
which is equivalent to free meals in
 
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
schools and 185 percent
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
which is reduced meals would be directly
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
certified through electronic data
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
matching for free and reduced meals at
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
school without their families needing to
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
submit an application
 
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid direct certification has
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
numerous benefits for children and for
 
00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.150 align:start position:0%
numerous benefits for children and for
schools

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
and the benefits to children are
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
children who eat breakfast and lunch at
 
00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.030 align:start position:0%

graduation rates
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
more children in the state would be
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
eligible to eat free meals at school
 
00:56:15.599 --> 00:56:16.390 align:start position:0%

provision
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
more directly certified children means
 
00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.069 align:start position:0%
more directly certified children means
more

00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
schools would be eligible to implement
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
the community eligibility program which
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
allows high poverty schools to offer
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
school meals at no charge to all
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
students without an application this
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
will further reduce errors in paperwork
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
and eliminate barriers to healthy school
 
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.349 align:start position:0%
and eliminate barriers to healthy school

meals
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
the benefits to school it increases
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
there's an increase in free and reduced
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
meal counts and resulting in an increase
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
in state adequacy grants
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
reduced administrative costs related to
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
and there's evidence from other states
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
that have participated in this pilot
 
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.870 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.190 align:start position:0%
yeah
yes

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
this is d.o.e
 
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.829 align:start position:0%
this is d.o.e
folks

00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%

00:57:53.839 --> 00:57:54.789 align:start position:0%

migliano manganello mark manganiello
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
megan nelson of school finance mark is
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
the right answer okay
 
00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.109 align:start position:0%
the right answer okay
so

00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit about
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
at the committee at the hearing
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
how this will impact adequacy
 
00:58:12.079 --> 00:58:12.870 align:start position:0%
how this will impact adequacy
and

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
the timing of this is
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
if we are successful at entering this
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
program meaning usda approves it cms
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
approves the sharing of medicaid data
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
etc then it would impact the 23-24
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
school year which would impact the
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 adequacy and in talking
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
with mickey
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 is a kind of a far far
 
00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.309 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 is a kind of a far far
away

00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
kind of far in the future and it's hard
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
to really predict what the impact could
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
be on adequacy
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
so it's really an indeterminable and
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's really difficult to predict what
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
this could do to adequacy it would be an
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
indeterminable increase
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
because we will have instead of using
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
our current fnr data we would have
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
better fnr data that better certifies
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
using medicaid so there would be an
 
00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.990 align:start position:0%
using medicaid so there would be an
increase

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
in our fnr numbers um so just i handed a
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
memo excuse me are you suggesting that
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
our f and r numbers right now are not
 
00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:05.750 align:start position:0%
our f and r numbers right now are not
good

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
they are not uh ideal
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
so yeah if and i i have a memo there
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
turn your microphone on
 
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.510 align:start position:0%
turn your microphone on
please

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
and talk into it
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
remember this is being broadcast and i'm
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
sure there are
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of people out there just
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
waiting to hear our every word
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:36.950 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
uh

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
my question was that um
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
using this certified through electronic
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
data data matching is more would be more
 
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.710 align:start position:0%
data data matching is more would be more
accurate

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
than what we're using now
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
correct it would help us identify
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
students experiencing poverty better
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
than our current methods
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:56.799 --> 00:59:57.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:57.839 --> 00:59:58.950 align:start position:0%
so
the

00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
if this i did a town by town handout
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
and uh if you look at the first column
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
it shows 167 000 students 159 000
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
students that's our base adm that's how
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
many students we have in
 
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
school year 2020 and then school year uh
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
22. so we have declining enrollment that
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
just shows you that but if you look at
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
the next middle column there that shows
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
the decline in fnr data and some of you
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
saw this back when we were doing the
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
2223 budget
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
we went from having forty five thousand
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
f r students pre pandemic and then if
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
you skip over two columns
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
we had about thirty eight thousand so
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
about a fourteen percent drop
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
so our fnr numbers are impacted as we
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
talked about by the universal waiver by
 
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.829 align:start position:0%
talked about by the universal waiver by
usda

01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
usda
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
said that no one needs to fill out the
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
application to get
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price meal
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
access so there's not an incentive to
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
develop the application therefore we
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
have not as quality data
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
this is also
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
regardless of the usda waiver districts
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
are constantly
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
as representative of berger as talked
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
about districts are constantly
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
hounding families to get their
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
applications in so it's an
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
administrative burden as well so as the
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
previous testimony discussed it would be
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
eliminate some administrative burdens on
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
schools and families
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
but the impact on adequacy would be to
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
better bring our adequacy numbers up our
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
fnr numbers that we use inadequacy to
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
something that matches closer to reality
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
but what those numbers will end up will
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
be well i've i have no clue but just
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the medicaid numbers we have
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
70 000 medicaid students
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
sorry not medicaid students we have
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
70 000 medicaid
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
chil eligible children
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
but that number is also inflated because
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
director lipman i believe he testified
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
to one of the work sessions or maybe in
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
the last week
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
right now no one is dropping off the
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
medicaid rolls currently because of the
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
pandemic so that 70 000 numbers probably
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
inflated because eventually that uh
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic enrollment um
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
kind of hold harmless that the medicaid
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
program has that's going to go away so
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
predicting how many medicaid eligible
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
students we have in our school is very
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
difficult without having the actual
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
student data
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
but if if we're just throwing out kind
 
01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:17.270 align:start position:0%
but if if we're just throwing out kind
of

01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
guesses which is that's what this is
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
it could potentially increase funding
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the cost of an adequate education
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
formula by 60 million
 
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:26.870 align:start position:0%
formula by 60 million
so

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
i think that's a high estimate i think
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
but that's that's kind of the best guess
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
we can have really it's an
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
indeterminable increase to adequacy in
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 and uh we'll know more as
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
as time progresses and we get better
 
01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.670 align:start position:0%
as time progresses and we get better
data

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
but just letting you know that this this
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
will have a cost but we have a really
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
hard time uh uh determining what that
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
i do have one
 
01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.910 align:start position:0%
i do have one
um

01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
would

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.549 align:start position:0%
would
be

01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
national program
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
so or you know or what information you
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
would receive locally so dhhs
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
controls controls and regulates the
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
medicaid data the way they would trans
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
transmit that information to doe is
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
essentially doe provides
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know all the data matching but i
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
believe doe provides dhhs a list of
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
first name last name and date of birth
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
and then dhhs will start matching in
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
their system and sometimes there's going
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
to be an easy match date of birth first
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
name last name that's that's automated
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
the system's going to automate automate
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
that and match that
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
then there's some
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
matching that occurs where
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
basically hey this looks really close
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
the first name is maybe spelled with a
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
as caitlyn uses the example of caitlyn
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
with a c k instead of a c so they go
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay let's look at this data and see if
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
it matches but really dhhs has all that
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
they do them they do the primary uh the
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
majority of the matching
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
cms regulates cms would uh authorizes d
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
program states to do this program so cms
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
is also looking at the controls okay
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay so all that would come back to you
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.549 align:start position:0%
is not
um

01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
well i guess that's my question what
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
would what would in fact come back
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
believe it would come back to us is that
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.430 align:start position:0%
they are
i

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh kelly might be able to answer this
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
but i believe it would come back that
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
they are they are just direct certified
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.319 --> 01:04:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
the student identifier is not used at
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
all in this process
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh we have this acid um we have this
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
acid we know what who the students are
 
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:01.910 align:start position:0%
acid we know what who the students are
but

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.870 align:start position:0%
but
uh

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.069 align:start position:0%
 
hi

01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
let me help you out a little bit
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm kelly rambo administrator for
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs and services for the
 
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.710 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs and services for the
doe

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
doe
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
so mark is absolutely correct the way
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
that the data is given to us would be
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
the same way that the snap is collected
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
so this is a program that is already
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
currently in place so it would be the
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
same as that program
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
the assassin numbers would come and then
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
it would determine their birthday their
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
first and last name
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
and then it would be indicative of are
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
they part of snap medicaid tanf or any
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
other programs that we currently already
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.990 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
personal data would not go anyplace
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
 
01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:55.270 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
okay

01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
yes so can can i just
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that i'm understanding this is
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
is it the is the process that you're
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
just that you're both describing
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
sort of this in other words
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
let's take it just for a school district
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
for for
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
school district x
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
doe would send to
 
01:06:15.599 --> 01:06:17.029 align:start position:0%
doe would send to
dhhs

01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
these are the here are all the students
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
in in school district x
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
and you would then go through that
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
and say
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay these
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
this num these students however many
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
that is a qualify under one of those
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
programs medicaid uh whatever the other
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
ones whatever the other ones are and
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
would send back
 
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.390 align:start position:0%
would send back
saying

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.349 align:start position:0%
saying
these

01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
these of the students of the names you
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
sent us these are the students to
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
qualify is that sort of the way it would
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
work yes except dhs owns their their
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
entitlement program data they own that
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
so they're doing the matching and most
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
of it's automated
 
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay but yeah the process you described
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
and this is the same process we use for
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
our current program snap tanf
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
just now medicaid would be part of the
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
equation okay i'm going to ask you one
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
question can i just
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
the one other question and this is
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
probably you you might be more able to
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
answer this does
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
am i understanding from what you're both
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
saying that medicaid the way medicaid
 
01:07:16.319 --> 01:07:17.750 align:start position:0%
saying that medicaid the way medicaid
works

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.789 align:start position:0%
works
it's

01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis including minors
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
in other words the way medicaid works is
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
not that for example if i applied for
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
medicaid and i was qualified then
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
my children who were minors would also
 
01:07:35.039 --> 01:07:36.470 align:start position:0%
my children who were minors would also
qualify

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
in other words is it is it done on an
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
individual basis including minors or
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:47.190 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
so that would be a a better question for
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
dhhs since they are the ones that
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
actually do the determination of it
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
that's not at a doe level so i don't
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
want to speak to that
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
but just so you understand the process
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
that we're doing here is that we already
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
have a process in place for this it's
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
realistically just adding another column
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
onto our data that we already have
 
01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.630 align:start position:0%
onto our data that we already have
collected

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
collected
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
so we already have the processes in
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
place for it
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's just adding another column onto it
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
if it gets approved and everything kind
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
of goes through just so you understand
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
yes represent murray
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh i proposed the 60 million i was going
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
to say 60 000. that would have been nice
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
i proposed 60 million is it appropriate
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
in one sense we actually already owe
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
this money to the schools but we are not
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
distributing it to the schools because
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
we have faulty data around free and
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
01:08:47.759 --> 01:08:49.110 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
yeah

01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
if you could you could definitely say
 
01:08:50.719 --> 01:08:51.669 align:start position:0%
if you could you could definitely say
that

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
i would i would i would i would say
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
i i would say
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm saying
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:04.950 align:start position:0%
i would say
that

01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
parental responsibility
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
is causing
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
that to happen
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
and that that's why
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
not that we don't think parents are
 
01:09:15.839 --> 01:09:17.189 align:start position:0%
not that we don't think parents are
responsible

01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
but sometimes their children are not
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
responsible and that's one of the major
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
reasons that we have this push so that
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.709 align:start position:0%
we can
hopefully

01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:09:28.719 --> 01:09:29.990 align:start position:0%
hopefully
identify

01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
identify
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
all the children
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
and it may or may not
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
result in increases in individual
 
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.709 align:start position:0%
result in increases in individual
schools

01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:09:38.719 --> 01:09:39.669 align:start position:0%
schools
so

01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
i hear you
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
but diff looking at it through a
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent god
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh the 60 million dollar guesstimate
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
just so i'm crystal clear here
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's additional money that would be
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
sent to the school districts not a
 
01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.189 align:start position:0%
sent to the school districts not a
redistribution

01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
redistribution
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
of the way it's currently funding is
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
if you remember this year we had money
 
01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:16.300 align:start position:0%
that we were able to send to reduce
 
01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.590 align:start position:0%
that we were able to send to reduce
[Music]

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
the swept
 
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.229 align:start position:0%
the swept
okay

01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
we may not have that in the future okay
 
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.709 align:start position:0%
we may not have that in the future okay
so

01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay yes i'll represent heath
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
now this is a non-germane amendment to
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
the bill that we're currently looking at
 
01:10:38.239 --> 01:10:39.830 align:start position:0%
the bill that we're currently looking at
now

01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
do you need a motion
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
for us to um
 
01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.990 align:start position:0%
for us to um
approve

01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
approve
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
could i please make that motion
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
that we attach this non-germain no you
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
just you just need a number so um i
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
would like to amend house bill 1627
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
with amendment
 
01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:04.470 align:start position:0%
with amendment
0875

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
0875
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
rep representative i'm sorry to so
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
that that is that's a correct motion i
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
will tell you that
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
there may be an amendment on the
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
too and i do have
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
i do have an amendment
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
already drafted that incorporates this
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
and potentially something the committee
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
may want to consider on the other bill
 
01:11:22.239 --> 01:11:22.950 align:start position:0%
may want to consider on the other bill
so

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
rather than adopt multiple at a time or
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
multiple amendments okay i'll withdraw
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay so we're gonna have to delay this
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh not necessarily i have something
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
drafted so if you want to pivot to the
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
discussion of the efa administrator
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
position and decide what the division
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
wants to do with that i have something
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
for that that
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know this
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
what was the change
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
this reminds me of uh hb2
 
01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.550 align:start position:0%
this reminds me of uh hb2
discussions

01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
i i know i know i know
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh okay mickey sorry so i do have an
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
amendment here uh if you recall um
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
the appropriation in the underlying bill
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
um funded the position in fiscal 22 and
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
23 which given the timelines doesn't
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
make probably a whole lot of sense so i
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
have an amendment here that would fund
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
the position beginning one july 2022 as
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
well as incorporates the amendment we
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
just discussed oh okay so it's kind of a
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
two on one so zero eight seven five is
 
01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.870 align:start position:0%
two on one so zero eight seven five is
gone

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
gone
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
and we have a new amendment
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
and you can marry you can make that
 
01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.630 align:start position:0%
and you can marry you can make that
motion

01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
bring to light that
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
before we had brought up that we would
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
need a administrative fee to complete
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
the application for that we had brought
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
that up in the in the other committee so
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's just something to keep in mind
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
for this amendment as well too back to
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to switch back to the medicaid
 
01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:37.669 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to switch back to the medicaid
um

01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
the medicaid bill
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
and and may i just say something yes
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
if you can sit here and promise me that
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
you will have no labs
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
other than that which was required
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
then i might think about it but i am
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
here to tell you
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
that every agency out there has lots of
 
01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.590 align:start position:0%
that every agency out there has lots of
money

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i will also tell you you can bring
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
that to fiscal
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
that change
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
and it will be approved so the answer to
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
your money question is
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm willing to do that at our april
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
15th meeting when my taxes are hopefully
 
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.950 align:start position:0%
15th meeting when my taxes are hopefully
done

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative i had asked if
 
01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.709 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative i had asked if
um

01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
esser funding would be appropriate
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
because in
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
essence this is related to um the issues
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
we had around copied so um
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
did you oh good looks like you have a
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
response for me
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
so we have posed this question and it is
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh unclear as to whether or not it would
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
be allowable at this point um it is not
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh squarely to prevent prepare for and
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
respond to the copa 19 pandemic there is
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
an underlying issue
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
in our fnr data that has preceded the
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic so that
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
that would be a stretch of an
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
interpretation is the sense that we are
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
sure and
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
just briefly i know
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
that the answer to the
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
request for fifty thousand dollars and
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
class 102 to enter into a contract it is
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
currently no but just again reframe and
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that we do believe
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
that it would take 150 to 200 hours to
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
just initially
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
fill out the application and then an
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
indeterminate number of hours for pass
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
back with usda and our conversations
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
with other states we have heard that
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
this is a significant administrative
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
burden and we currently have four
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
members in kelly's office which is
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
been administering 34 million dollars as
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to 14 million dollars
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
as was under those
 
01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.430 align:start position:0%
as was under those
uh

01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%

like to introduce to you
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that's uh had a lot of
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
work through subcommittee work through
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
working with the advisory council for
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
career technical education
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of thoughts gone into it it's
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
been amended and it's
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
forward it came out of committee on the
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's a bill that's uh
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
as far as education is concerned
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
probably one of our top three priorities
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
in education this year
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
sets up rcteas those are regionals
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
career technical education
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
agreements which are made every four
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
years between those schools which are
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
sending to a cte center and the cte
 
01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.590 align:start position:0%
sending to a cte center and the cte
center

01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
the four-year degree our four-year
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
programs uh rcte agreements i come
 
01:21:39.679 --> 01:21:40.629 align:start position:0%
programs uh rcte agreements i come
are

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
have to be approved by the commissioner
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
of education and the purpose of this is
 
01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.270 align:start position:0%
of education and the purpose of this is
to

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
try to have all these sending districts
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
along with the receiving district have a
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
calendar which is aligned between those
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
sending those receiving so we don't have
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
students in one district saying well
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're not at school today it's a
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
workshop day for our teachers we don't
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
go to school
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
or it's a vacation day
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
and the but the center is not on
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
vacation day and courses roll on we're
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
seeing a number of students which are
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
missing significant amount of time
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
so what we've done is we've set up a
 
01:22:18.719 --> 01:22:20.629 align:start position:0%
so what we've done is we've set up a
calendar

01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
which uh we would like to see no more
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
than 10 non-conforming days between all
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
the sending districts and the receiving
 
01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
the sending districts and the receiving
districts

01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
and we're not including any days prior
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
to labor day we know that there's a
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
number of districts like to start prior
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
to some that like to start afterwards we
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
went through a task force that the
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
governor set up years ago dealing with
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
this issue and came out with no resolve
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
but the commissioner has the authority
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
not to approve any agreement that has
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
more than 10 days that diverge from the
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
aligned calendar that we're trying to
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
come up with however the commissioner
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
and working with the
 
01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
sending districts and the and the
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
receiving district have the option
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
to to
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
look at exceptions there are exceptions
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
provided within this bill due to
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
emergencies or extenuating circumstances
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
and those extenuating circumstances as
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know some being on school boards
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of issues which come
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
up where you don't have a school day um
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
snow day um you have different events
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
which come up which caused the school to
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
be closed we certainly have gone through
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and that's definitely been
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
a a real extenuating circumstance
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
there is also a request where if a
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
receiving district and the
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
the sending districts aren't in a line
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
but they're working and making
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable progress towards trying to
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
get this calendar which will afford all
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
students to participate and have those
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
number of days that they need that can
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
be approved but it can't be approved
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
beyond july 1
 
01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.669 align:start position:0%
beyond july 1
2026.

01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
2026.
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
so there there's a cap on the amount of
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
extenuating days due to calendars not
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
being aligned aligning calendars is
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
something that state of maine went
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
through and they have successfully
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
gotten there so that the students coming
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
from the sending school to the
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
receiving school center are receiving
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
the number hours which they need to get
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
that skill certificate
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
one of the issues which we've looked at
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of cte though is that there are
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
some students that are held back in the
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
schools for
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
for reasons such as the course that i
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
need to graduate is being offered
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
concurrently at the same time that the
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
course of the programs are being offered
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
at the receivings and uh receiving a
 
01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
career center
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're trying to avoid that seeing just
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
in previous years we've expanded
 
01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.229 align:start position:0%
in previous years we've expanded
participation

01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
participation
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh four attendance at ctes down in
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
manchester right to grades 9 10 11 and
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
12 and to all other districts in the
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
state grades 10 11 and 12. we have a
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
number of freshmen and sophomores that
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
cannot attend and get involved with a
 
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
course or program seeing that the course
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
they need in the small sending school
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
is being offered at the same time
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
and so i can't attend over there and
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
that's the career pathway i've chosen so
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
they get out of sync and but we do know
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
and we've spoken to a number of school
 
01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.590 align:start position:0%
and we've spoken to a number of school
districts

01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
and centers where the competencies that
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
are awarded for that particular course
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
the remaining back-home ad to that get
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
can be received over a period of time
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
either through the course or the program
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
of studies that the person's taken be it
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
working in some kind of a construction
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
or diesel mechanics what have you at the
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
cte center and we know that there's been
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
some schools very very few because most
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
are starting to work cooperatively with
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
the receiving center but there are some
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
saying you will stay back and you will
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
take this math course with our math
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
teacher you will take this chemistry
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
course with our chemistry teacher for
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
all the reasons that you can come up and
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
think about they're probably using those
 
01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.070 align:start position:0%
think about they're probably using those
reasons

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
but we also know the sending the
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
receiving center offers those
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
competencies and the student could be
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
attending so that's the second part of
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment or as the bill has
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
amended the bill as amended by us is the
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
complete bill
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
and lastly we've uh changed the
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
effective date to july 1 2023
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
time to get this all in place uh in the
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
districts and working together we looked
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
at some of these calendars folks are
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
developing at this point in time we're
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
moving very closely with that represent
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
lynn is on that committee represent
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
umber as well you've seen those we're
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
getting there but we're not there and
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
most of the kids participating in queer
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
tech and ed centers are from the school
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
in which that center is located i.e
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
kenneth is one of them concord high is
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
another one but if you're from a sending
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
district to a cte center your percentage
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
of kids participating is much much lower
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
and we oftentimes mentioned to you we
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
need to increase number of students
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
participating in queer tech education
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
we compared ourselves to delaware the
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
state of delaware says the same number
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
of students as we do in high school they
 
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
have upwards to 57 percent of their kids
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
taking from these high schools taking at
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
least one course in this state it's down
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
around 14 17
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
we need to increase numbers going in
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
this direction and getting this these
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
skills that are needed today for our
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
workforce thank you very much
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
are there any questions uh yes
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this has been a
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
conversation for as many years as i can
 
01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.709 align:start position:0%
conversation for as many years as i can
remember

01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
what i never ever could understand i
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
know when i worked at the manchester
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
school of technology it used to be the
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
skill center back in those days
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
i worked with the school board and i
 
01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.709 align:start position:0%
i worked with the school board and i
aligned

01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
aligned
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
me like health care
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
with a science
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum so we had courses
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
that would fulfill
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
a course requirement for our manchester
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
city high schools i'm sure it's gone by
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
the board of after all this time but
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's something that always troubled me
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like what you're trying to
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
do in this bill
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
is to have an alignment with existing
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
coursework and align those competencies
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
so that in fact that student would meet
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
that competency required for high school
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
graduation that's correct representative
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
heath and when you were back in the
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
department i know we had that problem
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we're working towards that however
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
the the the need for us to push this
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
thing right now is we're right there at
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
that point where
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
we're not providing the number of
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
students four careers in the state the
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
way we need to be doing it and holding
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
back because there's this this issue
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about the the
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
competencies is another issue which
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
we've really discussed and these
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
competencies have to be written right
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
into their agreed with the rctea with
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
that agreement working with the sending
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
district so the sending district is the
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
outfit that provides the the graduation
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
diploma so we work with them so it has
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
to be approved there through your rctea
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
that's the agreement so i think we're on
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
the proper path
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of excitement in the uh in
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
the centers we have some people who i
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if i can make that but it's
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
we need to we need to get by this and
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
and get on with it and this is a bill as
 
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
represented heath just it's been in the
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
works for
 
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:56.070 align:start position:0%
works for
years

01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire some
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
northern school districts have different
 
01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.709 align:start position:0%
northern school districts have different
vacations

01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
vacations
 
01:30:04.719 --> 01:30:05.590 align:start position:0%
vacations
from

01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
the southern schools simply because the
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
kids they all do up north
 
01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:11.910 align:start position:0%
kids they all do up north
so

01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:12.709 align:start position:0%
so
my

01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
assumption would be then that the
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
northern cete centers will be
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
pretty much aligning their calendars
 
01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.470 align:start position:0%
pretty much aligning their calendars
together

01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
that that shouldn't be too much of a
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty to match those up or
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be statewide no it's
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
not a statewide deal this is within each
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
region and you know we have the 23
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
within this state and then we have five
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
ct centers outside all along that
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
connecticut river
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
and there's another issue we're trying
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
to align calendars
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
for representative ladd
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%

you and for those who guessed that it's
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
greek you should give yourself a pot in
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
the back
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
um prior to
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh two weeks ago working in at the
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
manchester school of technology i was
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
the director in milford new hampshire
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
and i worked as a cte teacher for 11
 
01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.750 align:start position:0%
and i worked as a cte teacher for 11
years

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
in exeter so so far i have experience
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
with three centers
 
01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:02.390 align:start position:0%
with three centers
and

01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
i cannot
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
agree more about the necessity to do
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
several of the
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
important topics that this bill covers a
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
couple of things every cte center is
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
different in milford approximately one
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
less than 10 percent of our students
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
were from other districts
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
but now in manchester approximately 40
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
percent of our students come from other
 
01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:26.470 align:start position:0%
percent of our students come from other
districts

01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about regions the
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
regions are different many schools are a
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
one school region portsmouth north
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
conway they are one school region so
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's no need
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
no great need for calendar alignment but
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
some others are very complicated concord
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
nine school districts that contain many
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
manchester we have
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
three towns three high schools we work
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
with but
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
then a lot more
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
milford is i think the best example
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
within the region there are three
 
01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.990 align:start position:0%
within the region there are three
centers

01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
centers
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
so not only do the three centers need to
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
work together and align their calendar
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
but every school that's related to that
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
region it makes it 21 school boards that
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
have to sign this regional agreement and
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
milford has been without one for many
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
years now i would guess at least four
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that was the previous
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
request for the 20-year agreement we
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
literally don't have a clue what
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
education is going to look like 20 years
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
from now so for that reason i
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh support
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
the four-year agreement
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
with wholeheartedly
 
01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:38.870 align:start position:0%
with wholeheartedly
we

01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.070 align:start position:0%
we
also

01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
calendar agreement the directors
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
collected information and we looked at
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
how many days does the average student
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
miss for who is coming from ascending
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
school to one of our centers
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
and their numbers vary greatly it's
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
between 20 and 80.
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
like there are 80 days when a 108
 
01:34:04.239 --> 01:34:05.030 align:start position:0%
like there are 80 days when a 108
year

01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:05.910 align:start position:0%
year
day

01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
school year that a teacher has to
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel because someone's not
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
there that day
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of resources if we had the same
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
pd days maybe manchester and another
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
school district could work together that
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
makes even more sense for the north
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
country where
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's even more difficult to put these
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
events together
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
i really like the idea that there is an
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
exception uh that can be made uh for the
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
centers that have not had the chance to
 
01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:39.669 align:start position:0%
centers that have not had the chance to
comply

01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
comply
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
because like i said it's tough to get 21
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
school boards to agree on one thing and
 
01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.470 align:start position:0%
school boards to agree on one thing and
three

01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
and 21 superintendents to come together
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
and agree on this
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
so having the exemption um makes sense
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
but what makes the most sense even more
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
is that we are starting in 23 because
 
01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
literally the schedules the calendars
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
for 20 to 23 are already set so um i
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
love the idea of providing more
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
courses other than cte courses to city
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
students that are coming you have to
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
understand that they come to us for an
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
hour and a half and sometimes they have
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
to travel for 20 minutes each way in a
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
bus that means they are missing two days
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
in their classes for school districts
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
that are on a four block schedule they
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
just missed half a day
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
every single day on a two-year program
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
for two years i've had students in
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
exeter taking vlax classes uh 10 years
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
ago before you know the day vlogs was
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
created so having this opportunity to
 
01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.990 align:start position:0%
created so having this opportunity to
um

01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
allow these students to stay in our
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
schools and take that math class that
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
they are missing
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
very helpful i feel
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
and then finally
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit about
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
competencies and
 
01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:03.189 align:start position:0%
competencies and
obviously

01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of math in a construction
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
class in a two-year program maybe not as
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
much as in an algebra one but the world
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
right now is inventing micro credentials
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i feel that we can do that too and
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't cover all of algebra in
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
construction technologies but at least
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
we cover
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
several sections of that and then we can
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
think about how we get the rest of it it
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
can be done virtually or it can be done
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
in person and then
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
we can give the students the opportunity
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
to take more city class courses or
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
participate in more programs and also to
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
stay in our schools longer and become a
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
part of our culture also and our
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
community and that's it
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you versa are there
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
any questions anyone has
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you i appreciate it so
 
01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.070 align:start position:0%

we have a uh
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
non-germane amendment that is going to

to start sometime after
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
2 30.
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
because we've got another bill that
 
01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
because we've got another bill that
we're

01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
waiting on an amendment 1624

so that shouldn't that shouldn't take
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
too long
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.390 align:start position:0%

our non-jermaine amendment we're not
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
going to discuss it now because we
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
haven't had the hearing but
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
look at it over lunch this replaces
 
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.950 align:start position:0%
look at it over lunch this replaces
1-1-1

01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:19.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

turning now to uh
 
01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.709 align:start position:0%
turning now to uh
1682

01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's amendment number 20
 
01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:48.709 align:start position:0%
it's amendment number 20
2022

01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
and what we are doing here is
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
yeah no problem
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
is um amending
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
the sum
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
that we are appropriating for the police
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
standards and training council
 
01:39:13.199 --> 01:39:15.109 align:start position:0%
standards and training council
from

01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:39:15.119 --> 01:39:17.070 align:start position:0%
from
uh

01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
350 000
 
01:39:19.199 --> 01:39:20.030 align:start position:0%
350 000
to

01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
175 000
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
and i we had basically all agreed that
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.350 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.550 align:start position:0%
no
no

01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
we did not
 
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
i hope not
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
the effective date of the bill is
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
already 1 january 2023
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
and i think the fiscal note had
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
included some ramp up time for the
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
position and i think our discussions
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
last week were to assume that this
 
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't start at least until one july
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.709 align:start position:0%
 
surely

01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
the language in the
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
language in the bill before this
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to change the amount
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
that that's in italics that was still
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
part of what we discussed the last time
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
um i would like to move um amendment
 
01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:40.709 align:start position:0%
um i would like to move um amendment
number

01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
one zero nine nine h
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
and what this amendment does is it
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
changes the appropriation
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
um from the um i think it was three
 
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand three fifty two um
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy five thousand for
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year ending june thirtieth twenty
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
twenty three
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh we'll give them time to um
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
hire a one full-time staff attorney and
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%

new information
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
that you wanted to
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
present to us
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%

didn't take action but
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking for anything new that
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
you'd like to add
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the committee for the
 
01:47:36.639 --> 01:47:37.590 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the committee for the
time

01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
that you're taking to consider this
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
after the last meeting and that we had
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to this bill
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
i certainly got the sense that it wasn't
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
going to pass this committee
 
01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.750 align:start position:0%
going to pass this committee
um

01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
but that being said i i
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
i'm very disappointed and disheartened
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
that our state does not have any kind of
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
statutory mechanism presently
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
to give immediate assistance
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
to towns that have been through
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
a natural disaster that such as what
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
acworth and langdon and
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
and in my estimation you know i wish
 
01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:31.350 align:start position:0%
and in my estimation you know i wish
that

01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
i could bring some sort of amendment to
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
fix some of the problems that you might
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
i would love this to be just an out and
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
out grant to
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
our municipalities as opposed to it
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
being some sort of
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
legislation where
 
01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.310 align:start position:0%
legislation where
a

01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
municipality would have to pay a fee to
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
participate in
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
get money out of this fund
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
i only did that because there were some
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
senators that suggested to me that it
 
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
preferable to have a
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
method by where towns
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
sort of participated and had skin in the
 
01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:19.990 align:start position:0%
sort of participated and had skin in the
game

01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:20.950 align:start position:0%
game
but

01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
from my
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
observations and my experiences with
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
what happened in my town in acworth
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
you know would have really been nice to
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
have the state come in and say here
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
here's some money to help you through
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
the immediate
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
problems that you're facing
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
you know a week or two after after this
 
01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:44.149 align:start position:0%
you know a week or two after after this
horrific

01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
horrific
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
i mean with regard to current statute
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
these towns can barely pay the 25
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
percent of damage
 
01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:57.830 align:start position:0%
percent of damage
after

01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:00.550 align:start position:0%
after
their

01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
putting in their
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
claim to fema
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
and having to wait
 
01:50:11.589 --> 01:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
so they'd struggle to even pay this 25
 
01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:15.030 align:start position:0%
so they'd struggle to even pay this 25
percent

01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
let alone being able to pay back a loan
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
as what current statute provides for
 
01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:23.430 align:start position:0%
as what current statute provides for
so

01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
i mean you know
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
acworth eventually did go to mascoma
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
bank and and got a 2.1 million dollar
 
01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.830 align:start position:0%
bank and and got a 2.1 million dollar
loan

01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
loan
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
why didn't they come to the state and to
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
ask to the state treasury for that money
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
well you know what in the first couple
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
of months
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
they kind of didn't know what they were
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
really facing and what they needed to do
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
the bureaucracy
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
to apply for some of this
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
our road agent and his three crew were
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
too busy fixing roads to sit down and
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
and talk to whoever they needed to talk
 
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
to from the state to get
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
any kind of
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh assurance that they would get any
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
kind of loan
 
01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
you have a time crunch you have to get
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
roads fixed and passable and safe for
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
your people as soon as possible
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
and we had our road agent consistently
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
i don't have the time i need to get out
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
there and and fix these roads
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
and get them passable because i'm
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
getting i'm the one getting the phone
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
calls from people that they can't get to
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
their house or that they can't get to
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
where they need to go
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
and um so you know it's a problem
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
of of time and getting things put
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
together as soon as possible which is
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
why i say
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's a shame
 
01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:45.589 align:start position:0%
it's a shame
and

01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
shame on us that we don't have a
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
statutory mechanism to give immediate
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
we have to look at the level of
 
01:51:57.599 --> 01:51:59.189 align:start position:0%
we have to look at the level of
bureaucracy

01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's too much time to spend on paperwork
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
too much time to wait for reimbursements
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
and our out our towns don't have the
 
01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:07.589 align:start position:0%
and our out our towns don't have the
time

01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
and they don't have the money
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking we're we're
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm dealing with what i've
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
dealt with is um the reality
 
01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:19.589 align:start position:0%
dealt with is um the reality
of

01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
towns not being able to absorb
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
the cost of the damage that's done to
 
01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:26.390 align:start position:0%
the cost of the damage that's done to
them

01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:27.189 align:start position:0%
them
and

01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much all i really wanted
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
to add to what i had to say
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
i realized the bill has imperfections
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
maybe wasn't thought through 100 percent
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
i would hope that
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
if this doesn't get passed in the form
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know that at some point we can come
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
back and
 
01:52:49.199 --> 01:52:50.310 align:start position:0%
back and
and

01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
do something better
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
because clearly
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done we have to
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
have a solution and
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
what we have now is not a solution
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i agree with represent what
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative heath had said in the
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
last time we met was that it would be
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
nice if we had a pot of money
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
and that when a disaster hits that the
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
state can lend its hand
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
to the municipality and say
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
here's some money to help you through
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
what you're going through
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that's all i wanted to say thank you
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
so much thank you
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%

01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
there's the the two senate bills 402 and
 
01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
409 have have the responses given you
 
01:53:47.679 --> 01:53:48.550 align:start position:0%
409 have have the responses given you
any

01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:49.910 align:start position:0%
any
any

01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
where those stand or how that how
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
they're going through or sure thank you
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative bucco
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
for what i understood with uh sb 402
 
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
which was the bill that would say that
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
that proposes instead of a 25 match to
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
fema funds the municipality pays 12 and
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
a half and the state picks up the other
 
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
12 and a half of that 25 percent and as
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
i understand that bill's kind of been
 
01:54:20.070 --> 01:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
stalled because there's no
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
understanding of what 12 and a half
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
percent represents to the state as an
 
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation they have no idea what
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
number to appropriate or to set aside so
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
they're kind of trying to figure out
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
what it is they're dealing with when
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
they're talking about 12 percent so
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's kind of stalled
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
the other bill
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
senator apprentice's bill
 
01:54:43.679 --> 01:54:45.430 align:start position:0%
senator apprentice's bill
which

01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
changes current statute to allow for not
 
01:54:48.719 --> 01:54:50.870 align:start position:0%
changes current statute to allow for not
only

01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
a declaration of emergency by the
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
president of the united states but also
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
declaration of emergency by the governor
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of like a
 
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
maybe an easier threshold to meet
 
01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:04.470 align:start position:0%
maybe an easier threshold to meet
it

01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:05.589 align:start position:0%
it
would

01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:55:05.599 --> 01:55:06.550 align:start position:0%
would
be

01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
the time that a municipality could ask
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
the state for a loan from the treasury
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know what other provisions were
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
made or what other amendments have been
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
made to that bill
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i don't i'm not sure what the status
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
if it's passed
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
i may have passed the committee with an
 
01:55:26.239 --> 01:55:30.070 align:start position:0%
i may have passed the committee with an
amendment

01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you did they let me follow up
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
please um
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
did did any of those other sponsors uh
 
01:55:40.709 --> 01:55:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh um advise you that maybe
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
a bill that would just
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
outright pay for the roads
 
01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.270 align:start position:0%
outright pay for the roads
no

01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
no there's no such bill like that
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
i mean it would seem like it would seem
 
01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
like you know they
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
when you submitted your bill that
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
maybe that
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
you know you got kind of the sidetracked
 
01:56:00.639 --> 01:56:01.430 align:start position:0%
you know you got kind of the sidetracked
or

01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:02.229 align:start position:0%
or
to

01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
for what
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
the fema all the fema rules
 
01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:08.629 align:start position:0%
the fema all the fema rules
um

01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
instead of just saying you know yeah our
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
road is our road's gone we have to
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
replace it you know
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
the state gonna help the small towns
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
that can't afford to do it on their own
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
right no there's no other bill that
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
would do that so that's what i attempted
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
to do with this
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
only i did add the component of a town
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
having to sort of buy into the fund
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to get a benefit
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
from it later and
 
01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
in retrospect i wish i hadn't put that
 
01:56:36.639 --> 01:56:40.550 align:start position:0%
in retrospect i wish i hadn't put that
in

01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%

uh thank you just for the record fallon
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
reed i'm with homeland security and
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
emergency management department of
 
01:57:12.239 --> 01:57:13.589 align:start position:0%
emergency management department of
safety

01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:57:13.599 --> 01:57:16.149 align:start position:0%
safety
and

01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned last time that there
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
was there were dollars available
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
from the state initially
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
so correct or am i
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
dreaming no um so what we have is the
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
exceptional disaster relief loan that um
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
senator guida had
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
pushed through back 2017-2018 time frame
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
so there's the loan available
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
which currently which is part of the 409
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill to adjust this time
 
01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
which previously required
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
a presidential disaster declaration and
 
01:57:52.639 --> 01:57:53.589 align:start position:0%
a presidential disaster declaration and
a

01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:57:53.599 --> 01:57:54.950 align:start position:0%
a
percentage

01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
interest rate that needs to be repaid
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know with negotiations with treasury
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
as far as money that the state goes
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
or state has that would be the only way
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
that we have the ability to give money
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
to the communities currently we're still
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
working with fema on the
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
disasters from this july and august to
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
assess that but one thing i did want to
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
make you aware of
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
past friday we were just made aware that
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
because the president signed the omninus
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
omnibus spending bill those two
 
01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:26.709 align:start position:0%
omnibus spending bill those two
disasters

01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:26.719 align:start position:0%
disasters
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
will be at a 90 10 cost share so it's
 
01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
only a 10
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
cost share
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
applicants need to pay back not the full
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
25. so um
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
i'm going to work with mickey and let
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
senator um khan know as well because
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
that may impact the other loan as well
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay oh that's a good thing yes it's
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
great i mean fema had been doing that
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
and we weren't sure whether that was
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
going to uh
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
continue or not but that's uh that's a
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
really good thing yeah so that that
 
01:58:58.950 --> 01:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
passed through um and we got word of
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
that friday so
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
we're doing all the appropriate
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
paperwork on our end but those two
 
01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:04.629 align:start position:0%
paperwork on our end but those two
disasters

01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
disasters
 
01:59:08.229 --> 01:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:11.750 align:start position:0%
representative heath
so

01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:12.550 align:start position:0%
so
if

01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
god forbid
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
we had a tornado hit the city of
 
01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:17.589 align:start position:0%
we had a tornado hit the city of
manchester

01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it really leveled
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
the city
 
01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:22.390 align:start position:0%
the city
um

01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
what would be available in terms of help
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
so initially kind of in the couple days
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
after the event the state is able to
 
01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:32.550 align:start position:0%
after the event the state is able to
help

01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
with you know personnel or equipment
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
that sort of stuff but financially we
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to do that
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
if 409 goes through with the adjustments
 
01:59:43.599 --> 01:59:44.790 align:start position:0%
if 409 goes through with the adjustments
and

01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
if the governor declares a state of
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
emergency which he has in the past and
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
is fairly easy to do compared to
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
a presidential declaration
 
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
we can then loan out money to the
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
community and then when we work with if
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
fema reimburses
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
the community then they would pay back
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
that but as it stands right now we don't
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
have any
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
means to
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
give the community money other than
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
through this loan process all right
 
02:00:14.070 --> 02:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sure
 
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
are there any other oh yes you have a
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
question okay i'm sorry what was in what
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
was the number 409 is that senate bill
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
sb4 yep thank you
 
02:00:26.070 --> 02:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
and then 402 is the one with the 12 and
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
a half um
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
and 12 and a half so the state would pay
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
12 and a half but we'll make sure that
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
they are aware that it's a 90 10 split
 
02:00:34.159 --> 02:00:34.870 align:start position:0%
they are aware that it's a 90 10 split
so

02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
hopefully be able to change the language
 
02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
to just say 50 and that way it would
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
cover whatever 50 you know split the
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
share in half
 
02:00:44.159 --> 02:00:45.350 align:start position:0%
share in half
so

02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully be able to give them
 
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
a number that they're comfortable with
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
and that would make sense in the future
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
if it goes back to 20 or 75 25.
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
yeah right now um 402 is just for the
 
02:01:02.709 --> 02:01:02.719 align:start position:0%
disasters from this past year oh okay so
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to make a broader um
 
02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
adjustment that i think would be
 
02:01:07.589 --> 02:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
something different but this this
 
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
specific bill just focuses on those two
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
disasters that were declared this past
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
july and august
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh is there um anyone else that want to
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
is there anyone that would like to make
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
can i just make a comment oh sure before
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
i make a motion that you probably fall
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
out your chair about
 
02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:43.589 align:start position:0%
out your chair about
um

02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
would it be possible you know i find
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
this troubling quite frankly that if
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
something terrible did happen
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know the governor usually shows up
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
on the scene and and you know people are
 
02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
paying attention
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
but the fact that there is no financial
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
right away until a disaster is declared
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
is really troubling um
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
is this something maybe we should study
 
02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit more um that we could ask
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
maybe for some recommendations about
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
maybe what should look like what are
 
02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
other states doing
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
i just feel like we're leaving people
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
in a real horrible situation
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
and on that note
 
02:02:37.109 --> 02:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
if i may so it varies state-by-state but
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
we could certainly provide some
 
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
information moving forward
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
many states have a rainy day fund
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
i did research a number of years ago
 
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
and i think it's illinois that actually
 
02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:52.310 align:start position:0%
and i think it's illinois that actually
taxes

02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:02:54.070 --> 02:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
fireworks and that pays for the cost
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
share you know that kind of thing so
 
02:02:57.270 --> 02:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of different things out
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
there but we could do some research
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
provide some information but really what
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
it comes down to is kind of rainy day
 
02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
fun type things
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
but we could certainly work on that and
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
so your
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
your motion is for interim study
 
02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:16.550 align:start position:0%
your motion is for interim study
okay

02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:17.589 --> 02:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a problem with that
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
that makes me feel a lot better
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
well i certainly want you to feel better
 
02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:38.790 align:start position:0%
well i certainly want you to feel better
except

02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
except
 
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
well we've actually been pretty
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
agreeable today so
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
does it matter that i can't find 1665 on
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
i was 1682. that's why i can't
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
represent romberger yes i feel like i
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
should just at least make the division
 
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
aware of an existing statute somewhat
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
along the lines of what we've been
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
talking about just so it's not a
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
surprise later on so rsa 913d is
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
relative to civil emergencies and i'll
 
02:04:21.669 --> 02:04:21.679 align:start position:0%
just read
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
kind of how it reads now so should it be
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
determined by the governor that a civil
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
emergency exists the governor may with
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
the advice and consent of the fiscal
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
committee authorize such expenditures by
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
any department or agency as may be
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to effectively deal with said
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
civil emergency and may draw from any
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
general funds not otherwise appropriated
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
so there is
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
not used overly common not not often but
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
there is something i know it was kind of
 
02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
discussed that there's nothing that
 
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
exists now i just wanted to at least
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
point that out to the members before
 
02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
but again that doesn't allow a town to
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
come in to get it
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
it would be initiated by the governor
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
correct right
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
be

02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:05:06.550 --> 02:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
initiated some somehow or other
 
02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:09.830 align:start position:0%
initiated some somehow or other
okay

02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
i have a question from
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
mickey can you repeat them the uh rsa
 
02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:20.629 align:start position:0%
 
rsa913d

02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
rsa913d
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
ok

02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
all right so we're ready for uh
 
02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
all the roll-ons yep all right so this
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
is on the 16
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%

02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
i don't have it
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
do you have that bill number
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%

02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
oh it was yeah on a while ago actually
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
um on the middle of february so that one
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
maybe was on our list of ones if it
 
02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
possibly passed to be referred here but
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
okay good i was having a heart attack
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
over here going
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
what about
 
02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:56.870 align:start position:0%
what about
uh

02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
i think i gave i think i gave that one
 
02:08:00.629 --> 02:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
to somebody else
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
relative to compensation paid to a crime
 
02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:05.030 align:start position:0%
relative to compensation paid to a crime
victim

02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
victim
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
i think division one maybe was working
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
on that one i think so too if they're
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
not there will be
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:21.589 align:start position:0%

02:09:54.079 --> 02:09:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
yep in 201
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh some kind of training going on
 
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
in our in finance
 
02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:13.589 align:start position:0%
in our in finance
um

02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
when they asked if
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
they could use the room i said fine
 
02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:19.030 align:start position:0%
they could use the room i said fine
because

02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
it was only one in two that were meeting
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
scheduled to meet on that day and
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
so we had our own rooms but then three
 
02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
yep

02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:10:46.229 --> 02:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:51.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:01.679 --> 02:11:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:35.589 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:56.320 --> 05:39:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:22.708 --> 05:39:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:25.030 --> 05:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
as i listen to
 
05:39:25.040 --> 05:39:25.750 align:start position:0%
as i listen to
the

05:39:25.750 --> 05:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:39:29.350 --> 05:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
testimony and the comments
 
05:39:29.360 --> 05:39:31.190 align:start position:0%
testimony and the comments
um

05:39:31.190 --> 05:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:35.110 --> 05:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
there was basically only one person that
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
one person that commented about
 
05:39:41.510 --> 05:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:41.520 --> 05:39:43.670 align:start position:0%
 
negatively

05:39:43.670 --> 05:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
negatively
 
05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
is there anyone on the committee that is
 
05:39:52.470 --> 05:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:52.480 --> 05:39:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:39:53.430 --> 05:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:39:55.670 --> 05:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
parking garage totally agreed needs to
 
05:39:56.948 --> 05:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
be done
 
05:39:58.948 --> 05:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
my question that's still not answered is
 
05:40:00.390 --> 05:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
exactly where
 
05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
is the money coming from is it partially
 
05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
ppl is it this is it that or do we care
 
05:40:10.230 --> 05:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh it is basically
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:22.548 --> 05:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
you know right right now
 
05:40:26.030 --> 05:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:29.350 --> 05:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
179 million
 
05:40:31.670 --> 05:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
in um
 
05:40:34.548 --> 05:40:34.558 align:start position:0%
above planned revenue for
 
05:40:39.190 --> 05:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:50.470 --> 05:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:52.470 --> 05:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
the reverend the last revenue focus that
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
came out
 
05:40:56.470 --> 05:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago was 191 million
 
05:40:57.750 --> 05:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it's
 
05:40:59.430 --> 05:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
but there's there's a few things that
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
have to be taken out of that
 
05:41:04.150 --> 05:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
um you know i mean but yeah that's only
 
05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
good for the day that it came out right
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's right
 
05:41:17.750 --> 05:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:20.230 --> 05:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
are we going to
 
05:41:22.310 --> 05:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
discuss the bill at the amendment as a
 
05:41:24.150 --> 05:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
whole are we going to do it in parts i
 
05:41:24.160 --> 05:41:24.868 align:start position:0%
whole are we going to do it in parts i
just

05:41:24.868 --> 05:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
i just want to talk about
 
05:41:28.470 --> 05:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
i just want to
 
05:41:30.628 --> 05:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
kind of let this one
 
05:41:32.788 --> 05:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
not have to have a lot of discussion if
 
05:41:33.750 --> 05:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
we're all
 
05:41:36.788 --> 05:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
basically in agreement with it
 
05:41:38.788 --> 05:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
the only reason i i kind of want to
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
bring the other part into it is because
 
05:41:44.628 --> 05:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that the other part
 
05:41:44.638 --> 05:41:46.150 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that the other part
is

05:41:46.150 --> 05:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:41:47.670 --> 05:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be honest to me is
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of inequity in it this the
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
semi guy who owns a semi truck is going
 
05:42:01.030 --> 05:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
to get a 25 rebate he's i mean that's 10
 
05:42:03.030 --> 05:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
minutes of him driving you know somebody
 
05:42:05.190 --> 05:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
else is going to get 25 somebody with a
 
05:42:05.200 --> 05:42:07.030 align:start position:0%
else is going to get 25 somebody with a
thousand

05:42:07.030 --> 05:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
but what's interesting about the the
 
05:42:09.120 --> 05:42:10.548 align:start position:0%
but what's interesting about the the
total

05:42:10.548 --> 05:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
total
 
05:42:13.510 --> 05:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
was 40 million
 
05:42:14.628 --> 05:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
which is interesting because we're
 
05:42:16.548 --> 05:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
looking for 35 million for a parking
 
05:42:16.558 --> 05:42:19.270 align:start position:0%
looking for 35 million for a parking
garage

05:42:19.270 --> 05:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:22.708 --> 05:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
so i'm not saying there's maybe
 
05:42:24.708 --> 05:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's 75 million we're
 
05:42:26.628 --> 05:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
looking at spending
 
05:42:26.638 --> 05:42:28.390 align:start position:0%
looking at spending
net

05:42:28.390 --> 05:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
net
 
05:42:31.270 --> 05:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:33.430 --> 05:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a way to
 
05:42:36.150 --> 05:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
take that 40 million instead of having a
 
05:42:36.160 --> 05:42:37.590 align:start position:0%
take that 40 million instead of having a
gimmicky

05:42:37.590 --> 05:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
gimmicky
 
05:42:40.548 --> 05:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
scheme and maybe
 
05:42:42.628 --> 05:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
using it some other way like towards a
 
05:42:46.830 --> 05:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:46.840 --> 05:42:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:42:48.470 --> 05:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:42:52.070 --> 05:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
i don't consider it a gimmick um but i
 
05:42:55.910 --> 05:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh i do know and i agree with what
 
05:42:57.190 --> 05:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
steve said
 
05:42:59.510 --> 05:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
and several other people said that
 
05:43:01.110 --> 05:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
we may need to
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
somehow rather adjust that so that it's
 
05:43:06.310 --> 05:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
not 25 to everybody
 
05:43:09.910 --> 05:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
like uh
 
05:43:14.150 --> 05:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
antique cars you know their registration
 
05:43:15.750 --> 05:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
fee is whatever
 
05:43:19.270 --> 05:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
motorcycles are 15
 
05:43:21.670 --> 05:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
so i don't know we were we were trying
 
05:43:21.680 --> 05:43:23.990 align:start position:0%
so i don't know we were we were trying
to

05:43:23.990 --> 05:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:43:28.868 --> 05:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
relatively easy without
 
05:43:34.070 --> 05:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
incurring a huge
 
05:43:34.080 --> 05:43:35.750 align:start position:0%
incurring a huge
administrative

05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
05:43:39.190 --> 05:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
burden on uh on d.o.t but
 
05:43:39.200 --> 05:43:39.990 align:start position:0%
burden on uh on d.o.t but
which

05:43:39.990 --> 05:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:43:42.868 --> 05:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that yeah which i agree
 
05:43:45.830 --> 05:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
because that the original
 
05:43:45.840 --> 05:43:47.030 align:start position:0%
because that the original
uh

05:43:47.030 --> 05:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:48.628 --> 05:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
way we were going to do that my first
 
05:43:50.230 --> 05:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
question was going to be today how many
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
man hours and somebody said it was we
 
05:43:56.830 --> 05:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:59.510 --> 05:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
so on this one
 
05:44:01.350 --> 05:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
the only reason i call it gimmicky is
 
05:44:03.350 --> 05:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
again you've got the semi driver who's
 
05:44:05.430 --> 05:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
going to get a 25
 
05:44:07.110 --> 05:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
he's probably going to get more ticked
 
05:44:11.510 --> 05:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
off by seeing that than he is
 
05:44:14.310 --> 05:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know gonna be oh boy i got 25 back
 
05:44:16.788 --> 05:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
for the average individual 25 or
 
05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
something uh
 
05:44:19.510 --> 05:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
i get somebody mentioned i'll go down
 
05:44:22.390 --> 05:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
and spend it on a dinner i mean
 
05:44:25.910 --> 05:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
but that creates rooms and meals tax
 
05:44:28.948 --> 05:44:28.958 align:start position:0%
revenue so there you it's a good thing
 
05:44:36.548 --> 05:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:39.190 --> 05:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
well just a minute
 
05:44:41.910 --> 05:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
represent murray had her hand up first
 
05:44:42.948 --> 05:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:44:44.708 --> 05:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
um i guess when i'm looking at this in
 
05:44:46.948 --> 05:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
terms of a cost to benefit i don't see a
 
05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
huge benefit to an individual and i see
 
05:44:52.390 --> 05:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
a significant hurt or loss potentially
 
05:44:54.868 --> 05:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
to the highway fund and to perhaps even
 
05:44:56.868 --> 05:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
a broader perspective with department of
 
05:44:59.110 --> 05:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
safety so i'm in the garage i'm totally
 
05:45:01.510 --> 05:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
fine with that but i just can't balance
 
05:45:04.708 --> 05:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the 25 to everybody to
 
05:45:07.030 --> 05:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
the impact that it would have on the
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
safety and transportation
 
05:45:10.948 --> 05:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
it will not have any
 
05:45:13.990 --> 05:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
adverse impact on transportation
 
05:45:16.230 --> 05:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
because the money will be coming out of
 
05:45:19.190 --> 05:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
the general fund it sounded though like
 
05:45:20.868 --> 05:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
there may be an
 
05:45:23.990 --> 05:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
anticipated expenses or man
 
05:45:26.230 --> 05:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
hours per person hours that we may not
 
05:45:28.150 --> 05:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
are aware of
 
05:45:29.830 --> 05:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
so the intent of this amendment and we
 
05:45:31.750 --> 05:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
can clarify that was that the
 
05:45:33.750 --> 05:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation in section 7
 
05:45:35.590 --> 05:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
any costs related to the issuance of
 
05:45:37.110 --> 05:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
these refunds would also be covered by
 
05:45:39.270 --> 05:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
this general fund warrant so while there
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
would be the department of safety
 
05:45:42.470 --> 05:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps admins administrative services
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
and treasury having administrative
 
05:45:45.670 --> 05:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
functions and the cost of issuing these
 
05:45:47.910 --> 05:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
checks it would all be paid for by this
 
05:45:49.350 --> 05:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
general fund warrant not the highway
 
05:45:52.868 --> 05:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:56.708 --> 05:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:00.230 --> 05:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes i still it does not tip the balance
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
in terms of a benefit to an individual
 
05:46:04.948 --> 05:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a burden to the state
 
05:46:04.958 --> 05:46:06.628 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a burden to the state
okay

05:46:06.628 --> 05:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:46:09.510 --> 05:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
so you have another idea
 
05:46:12.230 --> 05:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh my idea would be to remove the part
 
05:46:14.470 --> 05:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
that wasn't that that wasn't the idea i
 
05:46:17.350 --> 05:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:17.360 --> 05:46:18.948 align:start position:0%
 
but

05:46:18.948 --> 05:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:46:20.470 --> 05:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
well that that would be my ideas to
 
05:46:22.628 --> 05:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
remove those that part of this and stick
 
05:46:23.990 --> 05:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
with the garage
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
so you did ask for
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
i asked for a recommendation to replace
 
05:46:31.590 --> 05:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
the how we were going to
 
05:46:33.990 --> 05:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
give back money but anyhow uh
 
05:46:35.750 --> 05:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative heath thank you for
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
canceling your four o'clock meeting
 
05:46:40.948 --> 05:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
not a problem it just goes with the day
 
05:46:42.868 --> 05:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
it seems um
 
05:46:45.110 --> 05:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
actually my question is
 
05:46:47.110 --> 05:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
what is really the purpose
 
05:46:48.708 --> 05:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
of this
 
05:46:48.718 --> 05:46:49.910 align:start position:0%
of this
amendment

05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:46:51.670 --> 05:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
to me it just seems
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to use the word gimmicky it
 
05:46:56.470 --> 05:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
just seems to me like is this a ploy
 
05:46:59.590 --> 05:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
though um we're giving people 20 back 25
 
05:46:59.600 --> 05:47:01.350 align:start position:0%
though um we're giving people 20 back 25
dollars

05:47:01.350 --> 05:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:47:02.948 --> 05:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
during the last session we were looking
 
05:47:05.350 --> 05:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
for ways to get more revenue
 
05:47:08.390 --> 05:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
and here we're giving away money
 
05:47:11.830 --> 05:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
when we assume you know as i said um in
 
05:47:12.948 --> 05:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
we have so many needs i think of the
 
05:47:17.350 --> 05:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
department of ed there's not one content
 
05:47:19.030 --> 05:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
person anymore
 
05:47:21.750 --> 05:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
i think about health and human services
 
05:47:23.990 --> 05:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
the difference is what you are talking
 
05:47:27.510 --> 05:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
about are continual costs and that's the
 
05:47:27.520 --> 05:47:28.708 align:start position:0%
about are continual costs and that's the
difference

05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:47:28.718 --> 05:47:29.830 align:start position:0%
difference
okay

05:47:29.830 --> 05:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:47:31.030 --> 05:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
one time
 
05:47:31.040 --> 05:47:32.150 align:start position:0%
one time
only

05:47:32.150 --> 05:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:47:34.708 --> 05:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's why
 
05:47:34.718 --> 05:47:35.830 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's why
that's

05:47:35.830 --> 05:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:47:37.830 --> 05:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's what this is
 
05:47:40.548 --> 05:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
because the minute that we start talking
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
about continual costs
 
05:47:44.628 --> 05:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
that changes the whole
 
05:47:44.638 --> 05:47:45.750 align:start position:0%
that changes the whole
nature

05:47:45.750 --> 05:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
nature
 
05:47:48.310 --> 05:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
of what's going on
 
05:47:50.948 --> 05:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
okay and that that's why
 
05:47:50.958 --> 05:47:52.628 align:start position:0%
okay and that that's why
um

05:47:52.628 --> 05:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:54.830 --> 05:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
we are not looking at
 
05:47:58.150 --> 05:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
areas that are continual costs
 
05:48:00.948 --> 05:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
you know you might obviously you favor
 
05:48:04.628 --> 05:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
education you know i favor safety
 
05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh bob favors justice
 
05:48:07.440 --> 05:48:08.830 align:start position:0%
uh bob favors justice
um

05:48:08.830 --> 05:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:11.590 --> 05:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
len i don't know what his favorite is
 
05:48:13.510 --> 05:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
but say uh
 
05:48:15.670 --> 05:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
somebody you know and kate has something
 
05:48:18.310 --> 05:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
else and so does tom and so
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
we are not looking to create a situation
 
05:48:22.638 --> 05:48:23.510 align:start position:0%
we are not looking to create a situation
where

05:48:23.510 --> 05:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:48:25.990 --> 05:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's something that we have to fund now
 
05:48:27.830 --> 05:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
we did today
 
05:48:29.990 --> 05:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
pass i think what two hundred thousand
 
05:48:32.070 --> 05:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
dollars maybe
 
05:48:34.628 --> 05:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
that were continual
 
05:48:36.470 --> 05:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know and that's
 
05:48:39.910 --> 05:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
but we need to do that you know that's
 
05:48:42.070 --> 05:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's not like
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars instead of this then
 
05:48:45.910 --> 05:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
could we use the
 
05:48:47.830 --> 05:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
05:48:51.190 --> 05:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
to move doj or to that's included down
 
05:48:53.750 --> 05:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
here all right
 
05:48:56.310 --> 05:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.910 --> 05:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm biting my tongue because i think
 
05:49:00.070 --> 05:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to say anything thank you
 
05:49:06.708 --> 05:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:06.718 --> 05:49:08.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:49:08.708 --> 05:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:49:08.718 --> 05:49:11.350 align:start position:0%
okay
so

05:49:11.350 --> 05:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
represent lynn did you have anything you
 
05:49:15.590 --> 05:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
understand i guess um
 
05:49:17.190 --> 05:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know i i
 
05:49:20.230 --> 05:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
i i guess it it's in some ways to me it
 
05:49:22.230 --> 05:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
on the on the
 
05:49:24.948 --> 05:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
rebate for the registrations it sort of
 
05:49:26.948 --> 05:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
depends on you on how you look at this i
 
05:49:28.708 --> 05:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
agree with what i think what everybody
 
05:49:31.270 --> 05:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
has said that you know 25 we're going to
 
05:49:33.430 --> 05:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
give everybody back 25
 
05:49:34.868 --> 05:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
i tend to think that representative
 
05:49:36.708 --> 05:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
turcotte is probably right that it does
 
05:49:38.628 --> 05:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
seem a little bit gimmicky on the other
 
05:49:38.638 --> 05:49:39.670 align:start position:0%
seem a little bit gimmicky on the other
hand

05:49:39.670 --> 05:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
hand
 
05:49:42.070 --> 05:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
if you if you
 
05:49:44.390 --> 05:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at it as we're giving back
 
05:49:47.590 --> 05:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers 40 million dollars
 
05:49:50.788 --> 05:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
that is you know that that does sound
 
05:49:53.030 --> 05:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
like we're giving back something fairly
 
05:49:55.030 --> 05:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
substantial and
 
05:49:58.628 --> 05:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
i suppose you know in terms of
 
05:49:59.830 --> 05:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know let's
 
05:50:02.230 --> 05:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
let's let's take the uh you know
 
05:50:03.590 --> 05:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
something like suppose we suppose we
 
05:50:04.868 --> 05:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
were talking about cutting the business
 
05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
profits tax by some small amount i mean
 
05:50:09.430 --> 05:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
which we did well right no i understand
 
05:50:11.190 --> 05:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
but let's let's even say that it was you
 
05:50:12.310 --> 05:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
know suppose we were going to cut the
 
05:50:14.470 --> 05:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
business profits tax by like one percent
 
05:50:16.470 --> 05:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
instead of tenth of one percent
 
05:50:16.480 --> 05:50:17.590 align:start position:0%
instead of tenth of one percent
um

05:50:17.590 --> 05:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:20.230 --> 05:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
on i i would imagine that there are a
 
05:50:22.150 --> 05:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of
 
05:50:24.230 --> 05:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
relatively really small businesses that
 
05:50:25.910 --> 05:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
that would not make
 
05:50:27.670 --> 05:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
very much difference in fact it might be
 
05:50:30.390 --> 05:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
25 for some of those for some of those
 
05:50:32.548 --> 05:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
small businesses or 100 or 200 or
 
05:50:34.868 --> 05:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
whatever and again if you looked at it
 
05:50:34.878 --> 05:50:36.070 align:start position:0%
whatever and again if you looked at it
just

05:50:36.070 --> 05:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:50:38.548 --> 05:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis you could say
 
05:50:41.430 --> 05:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know okay they gave me 200 bucks big
 
05:50:41.440 --> 05:50:42.548 align:start position:0%
you know okay they gave me 200 bucks big
deal

05:50:42.548 --> 05:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
deal
 
05:50:44.470 --> 05:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the whole
 
05:50:45.990 --> 05:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
05:50:49.030 --> 05:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know how much money in total is is
 
05:50:51.910 --> 05:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
is staying in the in the public domain
 
05:50:53.750 --> 05:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to going to the government
 
05:50:55.510 --> 05:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's probably a pretty good chunk of
 
05:50:58.150 --> 05:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
money so from that perspective i guess i
 
05:50:58.160 --> 05:50:59.030 align:start position:0%
money so from that perspective i guess i
can

05:50:59.030 --> 05:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:51:00.708 --> 05:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
you know i can i can understand what
 
05:51:03.830 --> 05:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're doing here and it does seem like
 
05:51:06.788 --> 05:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively simple way to give
 
05:51:09.270 --> 05:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
money back to the taxpayers and so i'm
 
05:51:09.280 --> 05:51:10.070 align:start position:0%
money back to the taxpayers and so i'm
i'm

05:51:10.070 --> 05:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
05:51:14.948 --> 05:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:16.548 --> 05:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
05:51:20.070 --> 05:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you apropos your argument um i'd
 
05:51:22.070 --> 05:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
heard this pertaining to other issues
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
where there's a small amount that goes
 
05:51:25.590 --> 05:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
back to an individual and individual
 
05:51:27.830 --> 05:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
saying why don't you keep it and put it
 
05:51:29.750 --> 05:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
to some better use that benefits the
 
05:51:32.390 --> 05:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
entire state for not just one day when
 
05:51:34.548 --> 05:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
you go out for the hamburger but for the
 
05:51:36.230 --> 05:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
years and years and years you know like
 
05:51:38.470 --> 05:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
fix a road repair a bridge do something
 
05:51:40.548 --> 05:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
that has a benefit to the entire state
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
that is a lasting benefit and it seems
 
05:51:45.430 --> 05:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
to me well i have heard people say
 
05:51:47.990 --> 05:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
they would prefer the money used in that
 
05:51:49.990 --> 05:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a situation rather than getting
 
05:51:53.270 --> 05:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
25 dollars back and going to big geyser
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
whatever they called
 
05:52:01.270 --> 05:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:04.230 --> 05:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
if we did not have
 
05:52:08.628 --> 05:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure bill
 
05:52:10.230 --> 05:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
and what is it
 
05:52:12.628 --> 05:52:12.638 align:start position:0%
how much are we getting out of that
 
05:52:20.868 --> 05:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i i don't remember what that number
 
05:52:23.760 --> 05:52:29.030 align:start position:0%
yeah i i don't remember what that number
is

05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
so i mean
 
05:52:34.628 --> 05:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
i would have jumped on that but
 
05:52:37.030 --> 05:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
we we already have
 
05:52:38.708 --> 05:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of money that will be
 
05:52:41.670 --> 05:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
coming into the state for infrastructure
 
05:52:43.110 --> 05:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
it it
 
05:52:49.190 --> 05:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
and if we try to divide up
 
05:52:52.470 --> 05:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars among
 
05:52:55.270 --> 05:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:58.548 --> 05:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
uh the towns and cities it amounts to
 
05:53:01.590 --> 05:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
about 25 a town
 
05:53:04.230 --> 05:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know i mean that's
 
05:53:06.788 --> 05:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not that low but it's it's
 
05:53:09.510 --> 05:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
not a lot of money yeah i hear what
 
05:53:11.510 --> 05:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying and i think there's a
 
05:53:14.230 --> 05:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
difference just basic and philosophy in
 
05:53:16.948 --> 05:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
terms of it's still a big chunk of money
 
05:53:19.430 --> 05:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
and fixing one element that benefits
 
05:53:20.948 --> 05:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state even if it's only
 
05:53:22.470 --> 05:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
in one location of the state we all
 
05:53:24.628 --> 05:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
drive back and forth so i think it's
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
just a difference of philosophy in terms
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
of working that
 
05:53:32.390 --> 05:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
as long as the road repair goes to
 
05:53:34.708 --> 05:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
twin mountain
 
05:53:36.390 --> 05:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
05:53:37.830 --> 05:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
you don't care
 
05:53:37.840 --> 05:53:39.750 align:start position:0%
you don't care
okay

05:53:39.750 --> 05:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:53:41.190 --> 05:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
05:53:43.430 --> 05:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
hang on just a second um
 
05:53:45.510 --> 05:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
len will you mind taking over for a
 
05:53:47.510 --> 05:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
second i just need to
 
05:53:49.990 --> 05:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
go listen to uh
 
05:53:50.000 --> 05:53:53.190 align:start position:0%
go listen to uh
so

05:53:53.190 --> 05:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:55.510 --> 05:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
can i just add representatives walking
 
05:53:56.708 --> 05:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
out of the room
 
05:53:59.110 --> 05:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
why don't we take oh okay the 40 million
 
05:54:00.390 --> 05:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
dollars why don't we add it to the
 
05:54:01.990 --> 05:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
governor's 100 million dollars for
 
05:54:02.000 --> 05:54:03.030 align:start position:0%
governor's 100 million dollars for
housing

05:54:03.030 --> 05:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
housing
 
05:54:05.590 --> 05:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
and then we'd have 140 million dollars
 
05:54:07.110 --> 05:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
that we could do some really good things
 
05:54:09.430 --> 05:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
across the state for a lot of people i
 
05:54:11.830 --> 05:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
think would be so significant when we
 
05:54:13.910 --> 05:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
know we have a crisis across our state
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
right now in housing in my city of
 
05:54:18.230 --> 05:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
manchester it's horrible finding an
 
05:54:20.230 --> 05:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
apartment for under fifteen hundred
 
05:54:22.548 --> 05:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
dollars is virtually impossible
 
05:54:24.948 --> 05:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
so i think that would be i i would make
 
05:54:27.270 --> 05:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
me feel like we've done something really
 
05:54:29.430 --> 05:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
good with that money if we could add it
 
05:54:31.350 --> 05:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
to what the governor is already doing
 
05:54:34.230 --> 05:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
and he'd be a hero
 
05:54:41.510 --> 05:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:43.270 --> 05:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative one go ahead yeah you
 
05:54:45.030 --> 05:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
know i guess i have to say and i
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
understand completely where what what
 
05:54:49.030 --> 05:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying representative heath i
 
05:54:49.040 --> 05:54:50.230 align:start position:0%
you're saying representative heath i
guess

05:54:50.230 --> 05:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
guess
 
05:54:51.350 --> 05:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:54:53.350 --> 05:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
my disagreement with you is really sort
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
of a philosophical one and that is you
 
05:54:58.390 --> 05:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
know if you say
 
05:54:59.990 --> 05:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know are there things that it would
 
05:55:03.430 --> 05:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
be sort of nice for the government to do
 
05:55:06.230 --> 05:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
um i in some sense i can agree with that
 
05:55:08.548 --> 05:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
but where i sort of where i'm coming
 
05:55:10.628 --> 05:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
from it's you know there's always going
 
05:55:12.310 --> 05:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
to be something more that the government
 
05:55:14.070 --> 05:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
can do and so
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know i'm sort of not generally in
 
05:55:18.390 --> 05:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
favor of growing the size of government
 
05:55:20.070 --> 05:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:55:22.628 --> 05:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
so from that perspective
 
05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not uh i'm i'm much more
 
05:55:27.430 --> 05:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
inclined to want to give
 
05:55:29.510 --> 05:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
money back to the taxpayers and let them
 
05:55:31.430 --> 05:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
decide even if it is a relatively small
 
05:55:33.110 --> 05:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
amount of money let them decide what
 
05:55:35.830 --> 05:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
they want to do with with the money that
 
05:55:37.430 --> 05:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's you know i but i understand where
 
05:55:38.548 --> 05:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
you're coming from and you know
 
05:55:40.390 --> 05:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable people can disagree on these
 
05:55:42.150 --> 05:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
things i think
 
05:55:44.948 --> 05:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
05:55:47.030 --> 05:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
she sees pessica
 
05:55:49.990 --> 05:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
i know you meant um
 
05:55:51.590 --> 05:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see how this is growing
 
05:55:54.150 --> 05:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
government and that it is using money to
 
05:55:55.910 --> 05:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
do what government is already supposed
 
05:55:57.910 --> 05:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
to be doing and but i do want to say
 
05:56:00.150 --> 05:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
apropos representative heath
 
05:56:02.070 --> 05:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
this this is
 
05:56:04.310 --> 05:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's not 40 40 million sitting
 
05:56:05.990 --> 05:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere exactly it's 40 that we would
 
05:56:08.548 --> 05:56:08.558 align:start position:0%
be extracting from somewhere so i don't
 
05:56:10.868 --> 05:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
have i can't think about what else we
 
05:56:12.548 --> 05:56:12.558 align:start position:0%
would do with it because to me it's not
 
05:56:14.708 --> 05:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
there right now anyway
 
05:56:16.708 --> 05:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
but it's just the sense of
 
05:56:18.230 --> 05:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
taking money that
 
05:56:21.350 --> 05:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
is there for some use in whatever way
 
05:56:23.190 --> 05:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
and putting it back to where it's really
 
05:56:25.830 --> 05:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
not going to have a significant impact
 
05:56:28.070 --> 05:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
on any particular individual
 
05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
um i don't think i'm out of line
 
05:56:32.830 --> 05:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
thinking that's 25
 
05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
is a fairly insignificant amount of
 
05:56:38.310 --> 05:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
money to any family even you know and i
 
05:56:39.430 --> 05:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
05:56:40.948 --> 05:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
misspeak about families that are in
 
05:56:43.350 --> 05:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
poverty um but even two people going to
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's pays more than 25 dollars i
 
05:56:45.840 --> 05:56:46.628 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's pays more than 25 dollars i
think

05:56:46.628 --> 05:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:56:46.638 --> 05:56:49.110 align:start position:0%
think
so

05:56:49.110 --> 05:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:56:51.990 --> 05:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
let me make one comment sure and then
 
05:56:53.910 --> 05:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
and i have to agree i'll go back to
 
05:56:57.590 --> 05:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
using my word and that is gimmicky
 
05:57:00.150 --> 05:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
i can actually
 
05:57:02.310 --> 05:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
see individuals receiving this check and
 
05:57:02.320 --> 05:57:03.510 align:start position:0%
see individuals receiving this check and
going

05:57:03.510 --> 05:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:57:05.830 --> 05:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
you got to be kidding me 25 what are
 
05:57:05.840 --> 05:57:06.708 align:start position:0%
you got to be kidding me 25 what are
they

05:57:06.708 --> 05:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:57:07.990 --> 05:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
i could almost see people get more upset
 
05:57:13.110 --> 05:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
by receiving a 25 check when the gas
 
05:57:14.548 --> 05:57:14.558 align:start position:0%
prices are up three dollars a gallon
 
05:57:17.670 --> 05:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
from where they were um
 
05:57:20.230 --> 05:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
and again i i still got to bring up the
 
05:57:23.270 --> 05:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
the the inequity of the the trucker
 
05:57:24.708 --> 05:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
05:57:27.270 --> 05:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
the motorcycle owner or whatever i just
 
05:57:29.350 --> 05:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
i just see this is a not a good idea and
 
05:57:31.350 --> 05:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
would like to see it out
 
05:57:31.360 --> 05:57:33.110 align:start position:0%
would like to see it out
representative

05:57:33.110 --> 05:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:57:34.150 --> 05:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know the only other thing i was
 
05:57:36.150 --> 05:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
going to say and i and and i guess
 
05:57:37.350 --> 05:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
05:57:38.628 --> 05:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
one one of the things that would make a
 
05:57:41.190 --> 05:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
big difference on this is how much of a
 
05:57:43.430 --> 05:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
how much of a burden or an extra burden
 
05:57:45.110 --> 05:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
this would put on the people that would
 
05:57:47.030 --> 05:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
actually have to implement this would
 
05:57:49.750 --> 05:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
there be some way
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
of limiting
 
05:57:55.030 --> 05:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
who gets the
 
05:57:57.510 --> 05:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
who gets the money back well you know i
 
05:57:59.430 --> 05:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
guess as i think of i mean for example
 
05:58:03.030 --> 05:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
could we say that you know
 
05:58:05.670 --> 05:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh only people and just as an example
 
05:58:07.350 --> 05:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
only people
 
05:58:09.990 --> 05:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
um who have minor chil we'd take that
 
05:58:12.470 --> 05:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
same amount of money and say only people
 
05:58:14.310 --> 05:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
who are who have registered cars but
 
05:58:16.868 --> 05:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
have minor children would get
 
05:58:18.470 --> 05:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
would get you know
 
05:58:19.990 --> 05:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
presumably that would increase the
 
05:58:22.150 --> 05:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
amount but maybe that's very difficult
 
05:58:25.030 --> 05:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
to do administratively
 
05:58:26.628 --> 05:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
that sounds like an administrative
 
05:58:29.910 --> 05:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
nightmare to myself and i think
 
05:58:32.150 --> 05:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
mr lavoy agrees
 
05:58:33.510 --> 05:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
that that would be an administrative
 
05:58:33.520 --> 05:58:38.868 align:start position:0%
that that would be an administrative
vlog

05:58:38.868 --> 05:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
well that's representative i know we
 
05:58:43.110 --> 05:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do this with our without a
 
05:58:45.430 --> 05:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
chair here but i would like to motion
 
05:58:46.390 --> 05:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
that we
 
05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
divide the amendment
 
05:59:01.110 --> 05:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:02.200 --> 05:59:02.210 align:start position:0%
i kind of like the
 
05:59:02.210 --> 05:59:06.830 align:start position:0%
i kind of like the
[Laughter]

05:59:06.830 --> 05:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:10.230 --> 05:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
idea have a motion on the table madam
 
05:59:10.240 --> 05:59:11.430 align:start position:0%
idea have a motion on the table madam
chair

05:59:11.430 --> 05:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:59:13.910 --> 05:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
and uh by representative he's second
 
05:59:17.430 --> 05:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
invite representative murray
 
05:59:19.270 --> 05:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
what's the motion
 
05:59:21.190 --> 05:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
and the motion is to divide the
 
05:59:23.030 --> 05:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
05:59:25.430 --> 05:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
eliminate the um
 
05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
the section above the rebate
 
05:59:32.470 --> 05:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
and that way we'd be saving the
 
05:59:41.350 --> 05:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:44.070 --> 05:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
so your motion is to eliminate six
 
05:59:53.910 --> 05:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair i'd like to speak to that
 
05:59:58.868 --> 05:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mata chair i'm totally uh 100
 
06:00:03.670 --> 06:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
behind that i think that
 
06:00:03.680 --> 06:00:04.470 align:start position:0%
behind that i think that
would

06:00:04.470 --> 06:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:00:07.750 --> 06:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
cl clear out something that's
 
06:00:10.788 --> 06:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
would be very uh
 
06:00:12.548 --> 06:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
detrimental to this bill going to the
 
06:00:14.310 --> 06:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
floor i think with just the garage in it
 
06:00:16.470 --> 06:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
i don't see any issues and i think
 
06:00:18.548 --> 06:00:18.558 align:start position:0%
cleaning it up this way would make the
 
06:00:22.070 --> 06:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:24.948 --> 06:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
hey may i sure absolutely speak so i uh
 
06:00:26.310 --> 06:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
before you while you were out of the
 
06:00:27.910 --> 06:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
room uh representative heath and i were
 
06:00:30.230 --> 06:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
having a discussion and a respectful
 
06:00:32.708 --> 06:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
disagreement about about
 
06:00:35.110 --> 06:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
the issue of like what i think what she
 
06:00:36.788 --> 06:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
would say is don't
 
06:00:36.798 --> 06:00:38.070 align:start position:0%
would say is don't
don't

06:00:38.070 --> 06:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:00:40.070 --> 06:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
take this take the part about the rebate
 
06:00:41.750 --> 06:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
out and let's use the money for some
 
06:00:43.750 --> 06:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
other worthwhile purpose
 
06:00:45.030 --> 06:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
what i would
 
06:00:46.708 --> 06:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
and what i disagreed about is i thought
 
06:00:48.548 --> 06:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
that giving money back to the taxpayers
 
06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
was important but i think what i could
 
06:00:53.430 --> 06:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:55.110 --> 06:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
because i do agree with representative
 
06:00:56.868 --> 06:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
turcotte and i think with sort of
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
everybody here
 
06:01:00.708 --> 06:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
that that there is a certain amount of
 
06:01:02.868 --> 06:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
gimmickiness to the money the amount of
 
06:01:04.948 --> 06:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
money that we've been giving back and i
 
06:01:07.110 --> 06:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
guess i could go along with taking it
 
06:01:10.390 --> 06:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
with dividing it and not approving the
 
06:01:12.070 --> 06:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
the rebate
 
06:01:13.590 --> 06:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that we would we
 
06:01:14.868 --> 06:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
simply would not be saying we're going
 
06:01:16.390 --> 06:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
to use the money for anything else we'll
 
06:01:17.910 --> 06:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
just you know we'll cross that bridge
 
06:01:20.470 --> 06:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
when we come to it i could i could i
 
06:01:22.788 --> 06:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
could live with that
 
06:01:22.798 --> 06:01:25.430 align:start position:0%
could live with that
so

06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:01:27.990 --> 06:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
i just really want to go on record to
 
06:01:29.510 --> 06:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
say i totally agree with representative
 
06:01:30.490 --> 06:01:30.500 align:start position:0%
turcotte in this regard
 
06:01:30.500 --> 06:01:33.990 align:start position:0%
turcotte in this regard
[Laughter]

06:01:33.990 --> 06:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:01:40.868 --> 06:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:43.350 --> 06:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
oh don't talk about squirrels please we
 
06:01:45.350 --> 06:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
went we went through the squirrel debate
 
06:01:47.990 --> 06:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:48.000 --> 06:01:51.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:01:51.670 --> 06:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so the motion is to remove
 
06:01:59.190 --> 06:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
six and seven
 
06:02:01.350 --> 06:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
from amendment
 
06:02:01.360 --> 06:02:03.190 align:start position:0%
from amendment
1162

so mickey you'll have to have another
 
06:03:10.708 --> 06:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
amendment right to do that
 
06:03:12.310 --> 06:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes we'll have a new amendment
 
06:03:14.548 --> 06:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
drafted that would just add section
 
06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
eight essentially it would renumber it
 
06:03:18.788 --> 06:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
back up to number six uh you you could
 
06:03:20.310 --> 06:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead we've done this many times in
 
06:03:22.948 --> 06:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
the past take a take an action vote now
 
06:03:24.788 --> 06:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
on it knowing that i'm going to draft it
 
06:03:25.910 --> 06:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
and then i'll just email it to everyone
 
06:03:27.670 --> 06:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
once it's drafted rather than having to
 
06:03:29.430 --> 06:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
meet again no i don't want to we i don't
 
06:03:32.310 --> 06:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
want to meet again if we can avoid it so
 
06:03:34.470 --> 06:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to make the motion to adopt
 
06:03:36.470 --> 06:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
section eight
 
06:03:37.830 --> 06:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
06:03:39.910 --> 06:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
what about the effect of dates
 
06:03:42.150 --> 06:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh the effective dates we would just uh
 
06:03:44.948 --> 06:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
match it up so that one is effective uh
 
06:03:46.470 --> 06:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh june 30.
 
06:03:48.070 --> 06:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
so this that appropriation would affect
 
06:03:50.230 --> 06:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
or would hit fiscal 2022 and we would
 
06:03:51.590 --> 06:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
keep that intact
 
06:03:54.548 --> 06:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
in the amendment to 1661. okay so
 
06:03:57.190 --> 06:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
the effective dates are fine yeah yeah
 
06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll make sure that the effective
 
06:04:00.230 --> 06:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
date and the amendment that goes before
 
06:04:01.990 --> 06:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
the full committee wednesday will be
