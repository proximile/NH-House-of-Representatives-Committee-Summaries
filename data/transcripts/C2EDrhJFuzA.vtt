00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
no does anybody have any any uh comments
 
00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
for or against uh House Bill 362 because
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note has no costs indicated I
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
mean I kind of like I don't know why
 
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.590 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.909 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
representative well thank you Mr chair I
 
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
was gonna say the same thing that I have
 
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
no idea why this came to finan see how
 
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
all the work seems to be something that
 
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
most likely can be covered with the
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
existing budget and the existing U you
 
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
know Staffing and uh Frank
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
ly it seems rather non-controversial you
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
know let's look into issues and have a
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
report examining certain things I just
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
don't think we'll have a lot of
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
discussion around it you know I don't
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
want to make a motion right now but I'm
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
ready to make a motion
 
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 align:start position:0%
anytime well well suggest a
 
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
motion without further dialogue I
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion so you'd like to move
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
it I'd like to recommend that we
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
recommend OTP to the full finance
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
y oppos okaye
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
unanimous so we're now on a Hiatus until
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
10:20 enjoy yourself well that will give
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
me a 30 seconds to take the
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
notes I would I would mention to the the
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
committee one other thing we've got a
 
00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
concurrence from the from from the
 
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.110 align:start position:0%
concurrence from the from from the
Senate

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
just let me ask you uh we've been asked
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
to concur with with our house bill uh
 
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
468 which was the one about the $100,000
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
to rectify part of
 
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
educational rsas and stuff what the
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
Senate has done is is they have included
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
that but they've also set up a a
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
committee or a commission to work with
 
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
this independent attorney I I think it's
 
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
an excellent idea so I will tell Ken
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.629 align:start position:0%
 
recommend

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
yep and this well this actually expands
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
expansion yeah okay yeah if you remember
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he was in education we
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
no I don't think he was there but we
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
that we discussed that in Ed on the
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
education commit disc years right right
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
and we figured it would take six years
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
time well they they they they're more
 
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
specific in their language because they
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
talk about uh duplicative and contrary
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
and those kind of words so uh I think
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
they did a nice job I haven't taken a
 
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
look at the um makeup of the commission
 
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
do you do you recall what
 
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
the component
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
was uh one member of the Senate two
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
members of the House the commissioner of
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%

commission deems relevant to its study
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
and recodification process so it's
 
00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:02.829 align:start position:0%
and recodification process so it's
pretty

00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
bill took a long journey to get here U
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
so it was retained as you Pro probably
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
have seen in the record in the Senate
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
originally uh the bill came to the house
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh or or was began as uh a similar
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
program to what they have in the state
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
of Idaho which was uh began a couple of
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
years ago because like us they have a
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage uh particularly in
 
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
certain school districts and the idea
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
was to uh help reduce barriers for uh
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
those who wanted to enter the Prof
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
profession and I think that's really the
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
goal of the bill and what Senator Fenton
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh who is a prime sponsor um uh intended
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
to do uh there was the legislature
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
established a teacher shortage committee
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago that took uh a
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
two-year period of time to look at what
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
are the reasons that we're experiencing
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
a Workforce
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
shortage uh they also issued a series of
 
00:26:57.149 --> 00:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations on what would be helpful
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh to help alleviate viate that and one
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations was um a rural
 
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
and underserved uh educator incentive
 
00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
program that would help Educators in
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
their first years um when they've you
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
know racked up a nice amount of debt
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
having had the pleasure of both doing
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
student teaching and paying the college
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
that they went to to do that student
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
teaching um and in those first years
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
where in New Hampshire the starting
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
salary uh for teachers is uh you know
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
significantly lower than
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um and our New England
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
partners and so uh the idea was Let's uh
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
have a graduate this graduated increase
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
to not only uh help the educator would
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
also incentivize them to stay in that
 
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
particular School District because one
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that we know is that
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
the longer you get over those initial
 
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
few years of being a teacher um some of
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
the hardest um Parts uh period of time
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
in your career the more likely uh uh you
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
are to stay so um the house did change
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
this uh a bit so that it it um at least
 
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799 align:start position:0%
as we read it it rather than being a
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
loan repayment it is more of a a
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
incentive retention payment um and uh
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
but it as I said we are in a teacher
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
shortage um
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
and school districts particularly those
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
that you know struggle to have higher
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
starting salary salaries higher average
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
salaries um you know this is added help
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
uh uh for those districts and for those
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
students which which is ultimately the
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
most important thing that we have
 
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.130 align:start position:0%
qualified you know teachers um who
 
00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:04.310 align:start position:0%
qualified you know teachers um who
[Music]

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
are there and hopefully beginning a long
 
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
career in teaching so um happy to try
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
and answer any other questions you may
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
have um representative he oh thank you I
 
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
think this is a great idea um I know
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
when I was Deputy Commissioner um trying
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
to figure out ways to get those teachers
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
into the areas where we need them the
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
most now it sounds like from my read of
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
the bill that there's going to be a
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
commission that's going to kind of
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
oversee it is there any problem um with
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
teacher contracts with these um stiens
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be giving people
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
because they'll come through the
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
department of Ed I assume so the um the
 
00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:45.799 align:start position:0%
the commission specifically referenced
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
in here is the higher education
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
commission and they would be doing the
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
rule making uh here uh this so in the
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
budget uh you may recall in hb2 to there
 
00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.549 align:start position:0%
budget uh you may recall in hb2 to there
was

00:29:59.549 --> 00:29:59.559 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
a uh not somewhat similar incentive
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
program around the computer science uh
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
and so um you know this is being R this
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
is not something that is that
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
relationship between the employee and
 
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
the employer this is a sort of targeted
 
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
Aid that's coming directly from the
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
state so I don't think that would be an
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
issue uh we have had numerous
 
00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Department around
 
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
um and the need for that um and so uh we
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
would be eager to work with the
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to help them in
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
the the crafting of rules and process
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
for application so if I may and this is
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
specific to Public Schools yes uh rural
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
poor areas yes um and I should add uh
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
since we're in the finance committee we
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
W I would love to put a plugin for the
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
next budget to go from $1 to a a higher
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
amount of money um I think that's the
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
intention and Senator Bradley and in the
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
Senate finance committee when they did
 
00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
make this change to a dollar indicated
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
that that was sort of his hope that um
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
they could you know have the policy in
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
place and then you know explore the
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
finances in the subsequent budget good
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you just one final question so
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
this bill would um authorize
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
this group to get together and set out
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
and lay out the plans how it's going to
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
be distributed so we'll be all ready to
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
go into the next budget process I think
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
so I think so I think um as I mentioned
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
earlier uh the original model for this
 
00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
bill was the state of Idaho and the
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
program that they passed there you know
 
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
they uh so there still are a lot of
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
similarities there um but their
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education established a a
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
rubric to as the bill indicates to sort
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
of live within the appropriation that
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
they have uh to to be a and to be able
 
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
to score
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
applications um so that they could as I
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
said live within the uh resources
 
00:32:14.669 --> 00:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
established by the the uh the
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
legislature uh the uh this
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
is not too dissimilar as well from a
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
rural healthc care um program for uh
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers that was uh
 
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
established by the department ofth
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services um so uh I
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
think it gives the opportunity to put
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
the the finer points in place the
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
process so that's clear for uh people
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
who would apply um and hopefully as I
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
said go go go up from a dollar in the
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation represent
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
Miller thank you Mr chair um two
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
questions one what are the other
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
barriers um presented to teachers um
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
that would prevent them from staying and
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
secondly can you describe the typical
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
teacher who would have this uh male
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
female married not married with Children
 
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
without children sure um I'll do my best
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
to to answer what I can um so
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh sorry your fir your first if you
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
other barriers other barriers um so
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
actually the the teacher shortage report
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
that um was a House and Senate committee
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
did look at the barriers and issue uh a
 
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:30.919 align:start position:0%
series of findings not all of them are
 
00:33:30.919 --> 00:33:32.909 align:start position:0%
series of findings not all of them are
Financial

00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
um there is the individ the culture of
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
an individual school you know who's your
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
principal and how is that run um and
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
also the overall the challenges in
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
overall climate uh uh generally
 
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.950 align:start position:0%
overall climate uh uh generally
politically

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
politically
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
um and so the shortage report goes
 
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
through all of that um and I'd be happy
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
to provide the uh division a copy of
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
that I think it's worth a read and um
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
and this isn't the only uh suggestion
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
that they made as a um as a
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation so um not all of them are
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
are necessarily you know have a fiscal
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
component to them but um uh some of them
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
do mentorship
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
programs um you know that help in the
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
early years when you're um uh sort of
 
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
going to sink or swim as uh in the
 
00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:32.589 align:start position:0%
going to sink or swim as uh in the
profession

00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
so I oh I just had a quick
 
00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:38.430 align:start position:0%
so I oh I just had a quick
question

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
yeah um you know a description of who
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
most likely will benefit from this or
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
who are the teachers that are coming in
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
says gender age children not children
 
00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
status sure um I uh I could get back to
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
you on the the in sort of incoming class
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
of Educators uh you know it is overall
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know more much more um female for
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
sure um and uh the I think one of the
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
changes that we've experienced is the
 
00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:16.839 align:start position:0%
pathways so we don't just have the sort
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
of classic teacher prep you know I
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to be a teacher since I was my
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
daughter wants to be a teacher she's
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
nine you know um there are certainly
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
those out there but uh there's also been
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
the increase of uh teaching as a sec as
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
a second profession and so we've seen an
 
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
increase in licenses through the site
 
00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.670 align:start position:0%
increase in licenses through the site
based

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
based
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
licenses um the these are you know
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
largely the the second career folks who
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
um are have a plan in place uh to get
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
them to
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
certification uh feedback through their
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
uh initial years um on the um on the job
 
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
and um we've seen
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh a an exponential growth in those
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chair just I I don't
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
know if the question is for you know
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
Brian or for anybody else I just want to
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand correctly the
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
language in uh Roman numeral 7 the way I
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
read it if a teacher stays through the
 
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
four years they will receive payments
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
adding up to
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
12,000 I just want to make sure I
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly because when I
 
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
see total incentive award that wording
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
may be a bit vague so do I read it
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
correctly that they will receive each of
 
00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:44.599 align:start position:0%
those four payments adding up to 12,000
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
if they stay for the first four years
 
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
through four years yeah through the four
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
four that's H yeah thank
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
you each year yeah in the amount so the
 
00:36:59.069 --> 00:36:59.079 align:start position:0%
four amounts add to each other and if
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
they make it through the full four years
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
then they will add up to the
 
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
you yes uh thank you again can you say a
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more about the licensing when
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
you talked about people coming in as a
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
second career um I'm aware of people who
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
would like to teach in a public school
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
um but licensing is a problem and um as
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
an aside I hear you know there's some
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
discussion about lowering licensing
 
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
requirements which I do not support but
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
if you have someone with life experience
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
and would like to teach a course in
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
their area of expertise they can't um
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that they're told oh
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
you could form a club and is there some
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
you know potential for taking advantage
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
of people in the community with a
 
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
particular expertise who could at in
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
their Advanced years become a science
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
teacher or a literature
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
teacher uh so there there are a number
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
of Pathways that you can take for
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
someone who would fit in that category
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
so there uh I don't profess to be an
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
expert on the all the uh alternative
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
uh no those are th those are there and
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
then also you know for those districts
 
00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:22.839 align:start position:0%
that um there's Al there there's also
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
like an emergency authorization that um
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
is time limited you know
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
I think I I know of some people who fit
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
sort of some of the categories that you
 
00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
were talking about um but hopefully part
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the reason that is time limited is so
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
that if if that person
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
says I want I want to continue to do
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
this it's important that they find one
 
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
of those alternative Pathways with the
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh um you know the school administration
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
so that they can receive feedback on
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
what it is is they're doing well what it
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
is they need to work on and the sort the
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
pedagogy of of of teaching kids so um
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
what were the programs you mentioned I
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
did all four all
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
three what I don't even I still didn't
 
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.190 align:start position:0%
three what I don't even I still didn't
hear

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
you there on the Department of Education
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
website it lists a number of alternative
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
Pathways to becoming a teacher
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
alternative three is you produce a
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
portfolio and you sit before a panel of
 
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.030 align:start position:0%
portfolio and you sit before a panel of
individuals

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
all four you are given a preliminary um
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
license and you're assigned a mentor and
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
you have a form of various things that
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
you have to have documented that you
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
have achieved but over the years we've
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
seen more and more um older people
 
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
coming in to teach as second careers
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
especially in the areas of mathematics
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
and science um because it's very
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
fulfilling and um coming out of business
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
they've made their money and they want
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
to give back to their community and they
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
so there are those alternative Pathways
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
as long as they haven't changed um the
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
alternative four is one that we
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
use frequently for special education as
 
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
an assistant superintendent I had to use
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
that often because it was so hard to
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
find special ed teachers same thing with
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
math and science but um there are
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
Pathways you need you do need a college
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
degree and you need a certain number of
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
uh credit hours in in the certain area I
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't know how they look at um
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
experience now that that might be
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
something that might have changed but um
 
00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
I forget the um name of the band at the
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
department now uh uh Steve Apple um he's
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
he I you would call him and he could
 
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
tell you all this I don't suggest it as
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
a solution but as an option absolutely
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
and a par professionals too we're seeing
 
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.390 align:start position:0%
and a par professionals too we're seeing
more

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:40:58.109 --> 00:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
par par professionals um
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
going finishing college and then going
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
on to become
 
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.790 align:start position:0%
on to become
teachers

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
comments thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question now over the
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
last 10 years we've seen an 80% increase
 
00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:20.910 align:start position:0%
last 10 years we've seen an 80% increase
in

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
administrators all right now we spend
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
about $20,000 per student average class
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
size is 12 that's
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
$240,000 right I mean to do the
 
00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
math it seems so we're re allocating our
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
direction would you comment on it is
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
that well um so uh I think new H New
 
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
um started out in a place where I think
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
there was not the necessary supports to
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
begin with in schools and we we know
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
that we one of the reasons that we lag
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
in this Workforce area is that we don't
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
pay teachers enough and so um you know
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
and you all know that school funding
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
plays a huge role in that and as so the
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
when we see uh you know increases in Aid
 
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:20.839 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of that Aid is has to go
 
00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
directly into you know catching people
 
00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
up and uh school districts competing
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
with each other
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
to try and um poach other you know
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
teachers to uh come across to a school
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
district that you know going from a a
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
Newport to a Handover for example um so
 
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
that we have uh we and we also have you
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
know a series of other uh crises that
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
we're facing mental health drug
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
addiction that's impacting students um
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
and I think that schools haven't had the
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
support that they've needed and um
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
so uh I think that we need to do more to
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
help those students um I don't think
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing enough and so
 
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
probably coming at it from a slightly
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
different perspective but I think
 
00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
there's more that we can do and um and I
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
hope that uh you know the legislature
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
will continue to look at this as we go
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
into the next budget and talk about what
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
additional supports we can uh help from
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
the state level to also help you know
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%

00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%

some challenges as full
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
