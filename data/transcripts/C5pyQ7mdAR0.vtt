for example but passing a little bill
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%

deposited in the general
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
fund why is this little Bill important I
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
must tell you it is the last ditch
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
effort by my constituent Dr Ra Ralph
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
wolf to bring
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:44.919 align:start position:0%
legs in a
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
fire he has no living family but with
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
the wolf's support and devoted
 
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
friendship Mr Banu graduated from Rivier
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
University in 2001 with a degree in
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
computer science where worked as a
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
computer specialist and lived
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
independently in Nashua tragically The
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
Chronic pain and medical needs arising
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
from his amputations were overwhelming
 
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
and led to Mr bhanu's death by suicide
 
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
in August
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
20122 Dr Wolf worked with the New
 
00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:20.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charitable trust Division and
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
the ninth circuit probate court to
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
memorialize Mr Banu through a UNH
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
scholarship but in accordance with in
 
00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
State Statute the court denied that
 
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
request the Court's decision stated that
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
appropriating funds through the
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislative process appears to be the
 
00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
most straightforward legal path and
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's what brings 1303 to you today Dr
 
00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:47.959 align:start position:0%
Wolf and I agreed that
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
bhanu that Mr Banu would be appropriate
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
as the department U I'm sorry um Dr Wolf
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
and I agreed that directing the funds to
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
a department Within state government and
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
which serves the intent of Mr Banu would
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
be appropriate as the department already
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
operates the New Hampshire Refugee
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
program under the New Hampshire office
 
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
of Health Equity this bill as amended
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
directs any additional administrative
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
costs to be covered by the fund as amend
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
and as amended once the money's in the
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
fund are expended the fund
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
terminates so this is a little Bill that
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
is not asking for money that the state
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
is not getting anyway it's just asking
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
that the money be used for a specific
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
purpose to help children who are coming
 
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
to a new country like Mr Banu once did
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is however very important it
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
honors the life of a man who despite
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
facing unfathomable tragedies
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
contributed to the state and lived with
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
dignity perseverance humility and
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
frugality his life was very important so
 
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
I ask that you recommend HB
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
13303 ought to pass as amended thank you
 
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:06.839 align:start position:0%
um and I do have my written comments but
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
I also included the um decision um it
 
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
has a court decision and it um also has
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
um uh from the the ninth Circuit Court
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
um Mr bhanu's note that he left upon his
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
de prior to his death is also included
 
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
but it didn't copy very well I don't
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
know if you'll be able to make out um
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
his intent to have the money go for a
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
children's organization and I'd be happy
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
you uh yeah uh representative
 
00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you um I tried very hard to
 
00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
have this go to the Judiciary Committee
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
I know uh it didn't work
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the Court's opinion
 
00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
would have been easier to have it
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
earlier so I could have read it but um
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
did the court actually make a decision
 
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
or does the Court's decision say that
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
they don't have jurisdiction to make a
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
change could you just explain what their
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
decision was when I read the decision
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
and represent wber I only got it last
 
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.670 align:start position:0%
and represent wber I only got it last
night

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
night
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
so uh from from Dr Wolf but um the
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
decision by the probate court was that
 
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Banu died into State and following
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
statute that his estate goes to the
 
00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:27.030 align:start position:0%
statute that his estate goes to the
general

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
fund representative Murphy
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
sorry without wanting to be difficult I
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
I guess I want to know why it is
 
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate in this
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
case for us to set aside a court opinion
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
when we are asked regularly in this body
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
to set aside things like divorce
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
decisions and we always decline to do
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
that no matter how much
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
we might want to do other
 
00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:04.519 align:start position:0%
things well in thank you for the
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
question in the court decision it does
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
state that um legislative action is the
 
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
is the most I forget the words it's on
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
the last page is the most
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
straightforward path legal path to
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish what Dr Wolf who I should
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
have mentioned he's also been the um
 
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
he's not the executive but he's the
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
administrator of the estate he was named
 
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
administrator so it it was the most
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
straightforward legal path to ensuring
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
that those wishes could be honored thank
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
you yeah thank you representative Murphy
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just a question
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
that I don't know the answer to um is
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
there in statute a definition for a
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
refugee and um how do we Define who that
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
may represent and do they have to apply
 
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
for the funds in somewhere or another or
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
if somebody came in and had tremendous
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
resources was adopted had a fost
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
appearent would they be uh able to apply
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
for those funds or how would that be
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
distributed is there an application
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
process thank you very much
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy for the question
 
00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
um I would defer to the Department of
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services on that
 
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
because I didn't want to be that
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
prescriptive um the division of Health
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
Equity already administers ref two
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
Refugee programs so I would assume but
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
we know what that does I would assume
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
that it would be consistent with those
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
programs um and I I know that there are
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys here from the Department who
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
can speak more on you know how they
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
would manage this um so I I would defer
 
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
to them on some of the specifics thank
 
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
rang for bringing this to us uh my
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
question um is more about this whole
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
intent of just trying to make sure that
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
if possible this money is able to help
 
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
Refugee children um if the existing
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
Refugee resettlement funds are already
 
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with children as well um I guess
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand the necessity
 
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
to create a separate fund if children
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
are also included in the existing fund
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
you know I agree with you um when I
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
spoke with OSS about the intent of this
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
this is what they came back and I I'm
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
not familiar with the those other funds
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
or if this could have been added to
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
those other funds I mean that may be a a
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
solution I'm open-minded um my intent of
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is to honor a request by my
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
constituent who is Dr Wolf and his his
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
wife are the most generous humble
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
honorable people um Mr branu has not
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
been the only disadvantaged person
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
they've helped they've sponsored many um
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
Ethiopians to come over to this country
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
um Dr Wolf is probably the primary
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
person why there's an orthopedic surgery
 
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
program in
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
Ethiopia um there's a Orthopedic
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
Hospital and his huge portrait of him is
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
is when you walk in so um I trust fully
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
that his request to honor Mr Banu
 
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
through this is a very Val you know I I
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
I consider that a very honorable request
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
and I want to do everything I can to
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
make it happen but if it doesn't happen
 
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
specifically through this type of
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
program if it can happen another way um
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
I'm very agreeable to that I just want
 
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure it happens I don't want it
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
to get lost in in some
 
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.590 align:start position:0%
to get lost in in some
bureaucratic

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
mesh representative
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
you m representative R for taking my
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
question there's a couple of things that
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
I see as a note in here on the bill
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
itself talking about the administrative
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
cost and the bill does not as drafted
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
speak to using funds for administrative
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
reasons to support the administrative
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
fund would you be amendable to changing
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
the bill so that funds in the fund could
 
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
be utilized administratively to support
 
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:19.990 align:start position:0%
be utilized administratively to support
the

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
cause um that thank you for that
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
question um sitting upstairs I just
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
realized is the stack of the amendment
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm sorry I will get it to you as
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
soon as I leave this room but it was
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
amended following um a a conversation I
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
had with representative Boyd who was a
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor I believe had a conversation
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
with representative Lon about this so um
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment that any
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
administrative cost comes out of the
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
fund and also when the fund is depleted
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
when it goes to zero the fund
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
terminates so I and I apologize greatly
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
for not having that amendment I I was so
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
intent on getting that Court decision to
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
be copied and get everything ready um
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
but because I was coming from my
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
committee another Committee hearing too
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
you know what it's like so I'm sorry
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
I'll bring that right down thank
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
you representative mour thank you for
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I as you mentioned
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
I can't read that last page but did Mr B
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
bhanu specifically asked for a fund to
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
be set up or did he want the money to go
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
to the children directly and I ask this
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
because I know that there's an
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
International Institute of New Hampshire
 
00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:36.039 align:start position:0%
which deals directly with refugees and
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
so you know there would be no I don't
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
think a need to set up a fund when
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
something like that is already in
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
existence so would that is that a
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
possibility um I I wish it were but I
 
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
was at the probate court hearing and and
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
also reading the judge's determination
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
that um that note does not constitute a
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
will it does and there's different
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
versions of Wills classifications of
 
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
wills it doesn't meet any of those
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
standards because it wasn't witnessed um
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
and so the court had no um no other
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
option than to comply with what is
 
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
already in statute which would put it in
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
the general fund um I I would be you
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
know I'm sorry represent to get back to
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
to your the first part of your question
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
is um in the note and I'm sorry it
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
didn't copy well um he wanted his car to
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
go to Laura's World fund which is a um a
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
501c3 organization I actually founded it
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
many years ago and it serves
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged PE children around the the
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
the around the globe he did not mention
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
anything about his money and it wasn't
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
discovered or known until after Dr Wolf
 
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
began serving as the administrator of
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
the state that 100
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
31,000 was found in his check-in account
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
and this is a man that lived very
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
frugally um I believe he worked for the
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
nsha school district as a computer
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
specialist so he he didn't spend any
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
money and um but that money is
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
considered that his whole estate was
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
considered into State I actually don't
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
know what happened to the car but that
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
was the only specific request he made in
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
the note follow up thank you for that um
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
I guess so I know many volunteer efforts
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
um one specific there's aoka kids club
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
um in inner city Manchester who deal are
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
just bring in Refugee children um and
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
their families every single day and they
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
do it volunteer you know so I'm
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if if money like this could go
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
to a volunteer organization in which the
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
money there's no administrative costs
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
the money would go right into assisting
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
the children so would that ever be a
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
possibility as well I would support that
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
um Dr Wolf is here he can speak to it as
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
far as the intentions of Mr B i i would
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
support that but the way the statutes
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
are written now his estate has to go to
 
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
the general fund so if it goes to the
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
general fund and then legislatively we
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
take that money and allot it to an an
 
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
outside organization I'm amendable to
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
that but when this bill was in
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
initially drafted um I thought it would
 
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
make um be I guess simpler to just have
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
it go from this part of the general fund
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
to this part of a state budget so rather
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
than having to go outside the
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
state representative Merchant you had
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
and then representative Shapiro thank
 
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
you following up on the previous
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
question this touches upon the issue of
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
the state being responsible to
 
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you may be amendable to
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
allow for the state to take the funds
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
that are in the state treasury to have
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
those funds donated to a nonprofit
 
00:21:14.669 --> 00:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
organization so chosen by Dr Wolf that
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
way there it takes the state out of the
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
middle and allows the funds to be
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
utilized based upon the will of the
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
Doner and not have the stake in the
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
middle of it would you be amendable to
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
Absol make an amendment to that way
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative Shapiro and
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
then representative Weber thank you I
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
was going to ask a very similar question
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
so I will wave off okay representative
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
Weber and and mine is somewhat similar
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
but I think it for my perspective
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
because I actually was for a long time
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
an estate planning attorney
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that we may be able to
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
solve all the problems by saying that
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
those monies it would it would be a
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
complete redraft but if we said that All
 
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
the Monies which is cheet to the state
 
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.590 align:start position:0%
the Monies which is cheet to the state
general

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:12.039 align:start position:0%
fund by operation of law are hereby
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
directed to be paid to and fill in a
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
voluntary organization that people are
 
00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.590 align:start position:0%
voluntary organization that people are
comfortable

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
with yeah does that sound because that
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
way we have gotten around the issue of
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
setting aside court order we have gotten
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
the money into the state
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
funds and then we are as as our
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
legislative prerogative and as
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Maser has suggested then
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
simply directing the state to pay some
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
money that it has in a direction that
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature wants it to pay in and
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
and so if we
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
re drafted it that way and then people
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
fought it out with Finance to get it to
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
actually happen uh would that would that
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
work for you absolutely um I would ask
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
maybe some help representative we I I
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
would be glad to volunteer to do the
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
drafting subject to some suggestions by
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
my friends I think the thing I would
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
need to be told is what organization we
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
want to deal with okay now I appreciate
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
that um and you know I I suffered from
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
the ignorance at the time in filing this
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
bill because I was under the
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
understanding from the judge that it had
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
to stay within state government that it
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
was going into the general fund and that
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
you know I could specify what part of
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
the general fund you know what
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
department but um having it go into the
 
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
general fund to be allotted to a
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
nonprofit I'm I I actually think that's
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
a better solution because of the admin
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
costs they work with this population
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
regularly um and they would have they
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be behold in um to very strict
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
rules or
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
administrative uh requirements of their
 
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
staff is that if I could
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
just did you name a specific
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
organization then when you said it no
 
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
initially when when doctor wolf first
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
became aware of this estate he initially
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
wanted a a scholarship um formed at UNH
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
and that got him in connection with the
 
00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire charitable trust division
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
um I realized there would be a lot of
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
administration with the scholarship I
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
was and when I came on and it and it
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
didn't appear that that was going to
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
be as as simple as just directing it to
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
DHHS but then I see that's going to be
 
00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
complicated too if we can get across the
 
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
admin cost personally I I met Mr Banu
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
many many years ago on a couple of
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
occasions um and just my own opinion and
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
I'll let Dr wol speak out after me but
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
my own opinion is that um if if if his
 
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
money could be used to make the path of
 
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
another child coming into the US easier
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
I think that's a very appropriate way of
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
memory representative

Wolf push the button so the red light
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
Dr thank you for listening to
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
representative rang and for taking U toy
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
bhanu's uh uh estate uh um in this way
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
uh I think those of us who knew Tes
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
would want
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
his unexpectedly large estate to go to
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh a charitable Foundation either to a
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
university or uh to Children's Refugee
 
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
fund um he worked very hard his whole
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
life uh despite disability and live very
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
frugally and I think that is the reason
 
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:55.870 align:start position:0%
frugally and I think that is the reason
why

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
$131,000 is available to the state and a
 
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
charity okay thank
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
you you taking questions Dr Wolf sure
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
any questions for Dr
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
Wolf representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Dr Wolf for
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
everything you did for U this gentleman
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
and for others as I heard about the
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
surgical center um and we I think that
 
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
it would be wonderful if you also know
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
any Charities that you can pass along to
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee so that we
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
can better understand what would fulfill
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
the best life goals of to see Bur Anu
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
and um if there's anything regarding
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
children's uh children in Prosthetics
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
that might even be a closer tie I think
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
testi originally uh had said that part
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
of his estate should go to Lara's World
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
fund which is just a fund in marac that
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh finances scholarships at marac high
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
school and also does clean water
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
projects in Africa together with child
 
00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.909 align:start position:0%
projects in Africa together with child
fund

00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:27:58.029 --> 00:27:58.039 align:start position:0%
International uh I think uh but he would
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
be fine as representative rung suggested
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
with uh a uh his money uh his estate
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
going to uh children's Refugee fund
 
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
administered by whoever the state thinks
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
is the most appropriate uh
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
um organization that would sidestep
 
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.909 align:start position:0%
um organization that would sidestep
administrative

00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%

in Africa
thank

00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
much thank you oh I'm sorry
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I'm
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
sorry oh
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay I'm wondering if we could perhaps
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
refer this to a a subcommittee so that
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
we can um draft something and also have
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
a a more Nuance discussion perhaps with
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative TZ uh about uh appr rate
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
recipients sure and I I would offer to
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
do that informally but I think that this
 
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
is weighty enough and and you know we're
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
talking about a significant amount of
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
money I want I think it would be more
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have that a publicly
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
noticed subcommittee so that we could
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
sure make sure that the public can weigh
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
in on the initial impression of course
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
was that this would be was you know
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
right obviously it's more detailed than
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
we thought we actually thought we might
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
exec on this bill today so I'm not going
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
to on a subcommittee sounds very
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate so
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking the time
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh to Cy would be honored thank you Dr
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
will appreciate it also signed up to
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
speak today is John Williams and I'm
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
sorry I may leave the I just wanted to
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
point this out this a lot of money it
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
should be self- sustaining it should go
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
into a fund that generates Revenue so
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
that it can sustain itself for a lot
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
longer than just it's going to go and
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
again well that's why one of the Reas we
 
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.710 align:start position:0%
 
consideration

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
okay okay good
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
morning attorney Williams and attorney
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
leagan welcome good morning chairman
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
McDonald and members of the Health Human
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
Services elderly Affairs committee um I
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
want to say Happy New Year to you all
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
this is our first bill for the day for
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
us and for you as well uh and I have to
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
say it's always a pleasure coming before
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
this committee because we came here
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
today uh thinking that there was a
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
non-legislative solution and then for
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and also over here
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
where representer you actually came up
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
with the brilliant solution about how to
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
actually make this happen so knowing
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
this is going to go to a subcommittee I
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
think that's very important but we do
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
have to lay out at least a couple of
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
foundational issues just to making you
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
aware uh first off uh the underlying
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
action that's involved with the probate
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
court with this uh very wable individual
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
and and I think hats off to the bill
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh I think that the bill sponsor
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
well- intended and Dr Wolf those kind of
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
efforts really are very heartfelt when
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
you you hear that kind of caring and and
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
giving to individuals however from the
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint of the department we're here
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
to talk about process primarily the
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
refugee resettlement program uh
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
currently is 100% federally funded which
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
means that we cannot actually administer
 
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
something like this at the state level
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
without the use of the resources drawing
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
down on this very important dollar
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
amount that could otherwise go to a
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
charity so your thoughts about getting
 
00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and services
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
completely out of the mix is actually a
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
stroke of Brilliance we were going to
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
offer to you folks and we have to be
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
somewhat circumspect because the
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
department was not a party to the
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
underlying action here and in addition
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
to that it would also look very self-
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
serving if we were asking to having in a
 
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
case where someone dies without a will
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
having money sent to the department for
 
00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
us to come in and start trying to
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
collect on money as much as we all enjoy
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
those commercials over the weekend from
 
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.519 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state from
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts who talks about money is
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
Jing and calling in uh that's not
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
something we would ever do nor would we
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
have standing in this particular case
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
however prior to hearing this wonderful
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
brilliant legislative solution um uh I
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
have with me the wonderful attorney
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
Janelle Lan um and she works for the
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
department but I have to say with some
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
level of Pride she was the very first
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
law clerk the very first law clerk for
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
the perfect court system here in the
 
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so she's very
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
familiar with the laws as it relates to
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
Probate Court both from substance as
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
well as procedure
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
and so with that said however we're not
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
a party to the action we represent the
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so we can't be
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
providing legal advice but we did
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
believe that there was a non-legislative
 
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
solution to working with the court but I
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
do not want to I do not want to
 
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
frustrate represent rung who's been at
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
all those Court hearings or Dr Wolf
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
anymore since you came up with a
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
brilliant solution of perhaps another re
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
uh another Avenue to go so if you are
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
going to go the uh extra distance to put
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
something perhaps into chapter law
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
rather than putting it into a statutory
 
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
law directing the money that would
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise EST to the and I love that
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
word that's a fancy legal word that only
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
Janelle and I think represent Weber
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
actually knows what that meant they got
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
it right on the law school bar exam I'm
 
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
sure uh in in say lot but to ESET just
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
means that the money is going to go to
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
the state general funds and you can
 
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
provide probably a better legal
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
definition than I can around that
 
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
however I would suggest as part of your
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh that you may want to
 
00:33:56.909 --> 00:33:56.919 align:start position:0%
encourage a member from the Department
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Treasury because they're
 
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
going to be very much involved and they
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
can tell you in the same way we were
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
coming here today to try to help you
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
navigate the legal Waters of a uh leg of
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
a Judicial matter a matter before the
 
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
court and bringing in on an open pending
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
court case the legislature is something
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
that typically I've not seen and I'm
 
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
looking at RI Weber is not something I'm
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
sure she has seen in her travels here
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
very often as well with an open case uh
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
there may be a request to doing it but
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
there are separations of powers and
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
processes isues that need to be adhered
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
to uh that certainly getting the
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Treasury may be able to
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
give you the same outliers that we were
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
able to provide with a non-legislative
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
solution and they could at least let you
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
know what the language must look like
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
for purposes of doing what they need to
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
do and with that I I do have to just say
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
to attorney J leian who I brought here
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
who is going to educate us all with
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
girls of wisdom about all but because
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
you're already heading in a different
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
direction I don't think unless there's
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
questions or you know you would like to
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
add anything no I'll uh I'll I'll
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
certainly be happy to answer questions
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
but she elucidated me in over 30 minutes
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
and she's brilliant and so we'll just
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
let you know her testimony would have
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
been been
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
fantastic good morning representative
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
question I think I just wanted to
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
clarify with either or both of you that
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
um what I think we're
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
proposing does not interfere in any way
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
with the court proceeding the money will
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
EST cheat to the
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
state at such time as you get a final
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
order and the state will be directed by
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
virtue of whatever we come up with
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
drafting as to how the money that's now
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
in its general fund is going to be
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
applied and and we can do that
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
specifically as relates to that which is
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
cheats to the state from this estate and
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
I think that way we are you in agreement
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
that if we do it that way we're not
 
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
overstepping the bounds of the court
 
00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
because the Court's doing exactly what
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
the court is directed to do and then we
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
are only dealing with legislative issues
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
which we're allowed to
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
do I would agree with that
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative okay however I also canot
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
speak for the treasurer's office so
 
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
again to the extent that you do that as
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Williams indicated earlier it's a
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
good idea to include them in that
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
process because I don't know what their
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
process is I do not represent them but I
 
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
do think that that is a very workable
 
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
solution and follow up and if I could
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
just note that this is a second
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
committee bill and it's going to finance
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
and they deal with the treasury a lot
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
more often than we do and I and I agree
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
with John it's a brilliant idea I I I
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
think it solves a lot of the
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
problems other questions representative
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney Williams for taking
 
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
the question uh this funds I believe are
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
going or destined to go to the
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
Services inside of the budget for the
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
has this money already been earmarked
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
for something that if we pull it out of
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
the state treasury we're going to leave
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
a hole in the
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
Department's the answer is no no thank
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
you so no they didn't budget it because
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't know other questions and it
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
isn't going to Health and Human Services
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
anyway see no other questions thank you
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
both thank you have a thank
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
you I have no other um one I have no one
 
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
else signed up to testify does anyone
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
hb303 seeing no one I'm going to close
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 1303
 
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on House
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 1068 and recognize the prime
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Chuck rassie from
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
Rochester I believe
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman members of
 
00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.750 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman members of
the

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee House Bill 16 uh 1068 is
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
relatively simple bill I think the title
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
is probably a little bit misleading
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't require any
 
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
additional testing other than what's
 
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
already required under the law all it
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
does is required reporting last February
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
put out a report that basically said
 
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
that uh children are not being tested um
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
under the law that we currently have
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
where all children should be tested age
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
one and Age Two and they one of the
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
problems I actually I heard this morning
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
that a uh executive counselor here in
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
the state said that uh we are not
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
getting this information about how many
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
kids are being tested uh what this all
 
00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
this bill does is basically puts a
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
checkbox on the U the the medical forms
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
which children are already required to
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
have when they enter a kid a child care
 
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
or a public school in the state of New
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh so there is really no
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
additional requirements and it also
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
allows for parents to ex to opt out or
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
exempt out under the current law which
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
allows them to exempt out on on on other
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
things as well so there's really very
 
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
little that this does except for gives
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
us the information that we can the
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
better information to deal with children
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
who have lead poison in state in
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
Hamshire helps us a identify where lead
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
issues may occur it helps us identify
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
those students who have the problems uh
 
00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
and the the students that weren't
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
getting tested and aren't getting tested
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
um now that when when they come into a
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
school all it requires the school
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
department or the uh the child care to
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
do is to give the parents the
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
information that says that this is what
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
you can do as far as getting your child
 
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
tested what are the hazards have led um
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
and that's all that's required under the
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
bill um that the parents be informed
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
and that there be a checkbox on the uh
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
the form that they're already um
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
required to uh uh to provide the school
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
districts when they enter School in in
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'll be happy to take any
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
questions so hopefully this is real
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
schedule thank you so much for your
 
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
testimony and thank you for the bill am
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
I correct in understanding that this is
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
an identical Bill to a bill we passed
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
representative Grassi for being here and
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
bringing more discussion to this um my
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
question is regarding the administrative
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
costs for these schools and daycares
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
that are already under significant
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
budgetary process um if they do this
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
electronically what it's going to cost
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
for them to incre add that into their
 
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
their student data they're already
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
requiring they're already required to
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
have quite a bit of student data as far
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
as the health forms are concerned I know
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
if you go into a school I worked in a
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
school and every time we went off
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
property we had our health forms with us
 
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
um this is just another basically
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
checkbox in there that says that the
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
child was tested for lead and if they
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
tested positive for lead uh what the
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
standards were and it's all protected
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
under HEPA uh so there's nothing that
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
information is going to get out to
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
people uh so there shouldn't be any any
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
major additional cost uh for any school
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
or uh any child care uh they're already
 
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
required to collect a large amount of
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
data this is just one small additional
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
piece followup followup um thank you for
 
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
the followup um you spoke about the need
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
for this data because you wanted to know
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
the areas where there were students who
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
were under tested where there may be a
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
higher rate of lead testing and that
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
information if it just resides on a form
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
within the school doesn't actually lead
 
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
to any of that information process we've
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
had a lot of other really
 
00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.910 align:start position:0%
had a lot of other really
well-intentioned

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
really really thoughtful bills before us
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
that talk about adding something to the
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
process so that we can have more
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
information or just to be able to
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
provide people more privacy but every
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
single check box cost that money um do
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
you have any appropriation in order to
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
fund that additional cost on our local
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
school districts in order to cover that
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
cost of collecting that data and
 
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
providing it to whoever would report
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
this for those populationbased data that
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking to gather I I don't see
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
any addition any significant additional
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
cost and I don't I I mean try to you
 
00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
know what it would take 15 seconds for
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
somebody to type in an additional box
 
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
that HHS uh DHHS would provide to them I
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
mean most of the information that we
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
have the required information they have
 
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
comes from the Health and Human Services
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
um and it can be done electronically or
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
paper forms that are all provided by
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and we already
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
have all that information available
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
already so it's not something that it's
 
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
new to hand hand out to people uh on the
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
hazards of of Leed and the requirement
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
that they just provide this additional
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
box when the doctor gets this form that
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
a child has to uh uh from from your uh
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
child uh doctor your children's doctor
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
when he fills out the form when your
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
child's getting ready to school it's
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
just going to be one more thing that
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
he's going to fill in uh so if it takes
 
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
him an extra three minutes to do
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
something in a medical office to prick a
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
finger to get a to get a blood report or
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
to take a drawing of blood a sample of
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
blood for a child uh again the law
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
currently says that all children ages of
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
one and two are supposed to be tested so
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
the it's already in the law so there
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any additional
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
other thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
president of grassy for taking my
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
question um the way I read the bill as
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
written if you go back and look at page
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
one lines
 
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
10 if they haven't had a
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
blood lead level test to the time of
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
first entry to the school they're
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
required to get one
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
help me understand if I'm coming into
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
the school for the first time I'm in the
 
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.630 align:start position:0%
the school for the first time I'm in the
ninth

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
ninth
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
grade why would I go back get a blood
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
level test when at that point in time
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's really meaningless um you I agree
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
with you ages one and two is where you
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
want to get to it but they're re the way
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
I read this if they come into the
 
00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:17.950 align:start position:0%
I read this if they come into the
school

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
system they're required to have a
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
documentation of a blood level test but
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say at that point in time if
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
they're over a certain age age is not
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
required it it says in there if you look
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
at the third line from the bottom on
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
page one it says for AE children ages
 
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
six years or under is and and then it
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
also provides an exemption unless
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
Exempted so it would be anyone over six
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
years of age I don't see it would be
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
required but it would be part of their
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
medical forms which that they would have
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
to provide and they need IM certain
 
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
immunizations to enter schools in the
 
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire correct that deals with child
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
care doesn't deal with the
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
school I'm referring to the school I
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with the child care on
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
the bottom but when you look at the one
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
for the schol into school you're right
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
right that's all just just clarification
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:21.559 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question can
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
you describe you said this is really
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
just about reporting yeah um can you
 
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
describe the consequences of
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
not having this happening like like some
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
people are concerned about costs what
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
are the costs of missing children's who
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
have lead significant lead in their
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
blood I think it's significant and the
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
thing is is that the Department of
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services put out this
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
report in February of February 10th
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
2023 uh that basically went through they
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
were concerned that because of covid we
 
00:45:55.549 --> 00:45:55.559 align:start position:0%
had lost a lot of kids children who
 
00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
weren't being tested um and that but
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
they weren't they weren't sure of that
 
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
if they were being tested or not they
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
just didn't have any way of getting that
 
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
reporting they assumed that the testing
 
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't occurring um when you take a look
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
at what occurs in um in our schools as
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
particularly with special EDS uh
 
00:46:17.549 --> 00:46:17.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes the exposure to lead can give
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
us an indication that a child may need
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
special services and when you're locking
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
at special services you can be up to
 
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars having
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
work been special Le for 10 years in the
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
Rochester school system I know the needs
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
of these children and whether it be lead
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
exposure or uh parental drug use or
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
alcoholism and with their parents
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it's significant
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
cost and this is just one way hopefully
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
we can nip that in the bud if we can
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
identify at an earlier age and and maybe
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
this won't be a problem at all if we put
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
this in and we require it doctors are
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to stop waking up and saying you
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
know we got to get this testing done at
 
00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
ages one and two or when you come in for
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
your check prior to going going to to
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
school you just get it done as a routine
 
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
um you know whatever reason it is it's
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
not getting done it wasn't getting done
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
and we've missed a number of children
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
and this will make sure that we get a
 
00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
getting I'll see you this afternoon I
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
yes you did thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
record I am representative Wendy Thomas

and I represent the town of
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
marac um this bill protects New
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's children by testing for lead
 
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.670 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's children by testing for lead
blood

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
blood
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
levels why do we need this we need it to
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
correct a problem that has been
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
happening for a while lead is most often
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
found in houses that are built before
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
1978 hello North Country
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
this bill in particular would benefit
 
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
greatly those that live in the North

country that live in a lot of older
 
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
houses one summer my son and I walked
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
the length of New Hampshire we started
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
at Canada and went down to
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and so we got to literally
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
see um many of the old houses up north
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
they're magnificent but they're filled
 
00:48:17.559 --> 00:48:18.990 align:start position:0%
they're magnificent but they're filled
with

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
lead lead leads to headaches cramps
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%

00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
issues I would argue um based on the
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
earlier conversation that if a ninth
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
grader is coming to New Hampshire for
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
the first time that they would be that
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
we would require them to get their uh
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
lead blood uh level checked um because
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
it does uh affect the body it doesn't
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
the effects of lead on the body don't
 
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
stop at ages 1 to two adults uh can be
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
very harmed by this lead is a silent
 
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
killer it doesn't have any symptoms
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
initially so you don't know you're
 
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
unloading this this uh chemical into
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
your body it's very similar actually to
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
pest what we're going through lead is an
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
environmental toxin just like pasas
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
is um so what do we do um why would we
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
want this information and and and what's
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
the significance of it first is that it
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
identifies the source if a child comes
 
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
in with high lead in their blood then we
 
00:49:33.549 --> 00:49:33.559 align:start position:0%
start looking at the house we start
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
looking at where they play we start
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
looking at different places that's the
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
key the Second Step In some cases not in
 
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
all but we can use um a process called
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
cation which is medication that it binds
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
to heavy metals and it can pull some of
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
the blood uh some of the lead out of the
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
blood but you have to know it's there
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
before you can do these treatments so
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
this bill serves to protect New
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Children's Health it gives
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
them a chance to treat and overcome lead
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
exposure so that it won't impact the
 
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives it is a proactive
 
00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
and health protective uh
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
step and this bill protects New
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's children oh one
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
second um it it uh it will help identify
 
00:50:22.349 --> 00:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
those that need treatment I'm sorry I
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
got a little confused there and I just
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to read re iterate there was a
 
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
question about administrative costs when
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
I was a um
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
a a a software developer for Education
 
00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
we were always shown a chart and it was
 
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
if you have a mistake in your education
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning of the development
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
phase it takes minutes or hours to fix
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
it but if you wait until the end and
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
it's published or something you've got a
 
00:50:52.589 --> 00:50:52.599 align:start position:0%
problem and it's going to be more cost
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
effective if we can identify these
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
problems earlier we can fix them we can
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
help these kids and it won't lead to
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
kids that have significant health issues
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
question I struggle with this because
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
this is definitely a a real concern but
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
I also see it as a two-prong problem
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
one is identifying it so you can uh
 
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
address it in the kids which is
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
important but then uh as you mentioned
 
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
find the source now we have another
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
problem because we have homeowners we
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
have landlords out there that are now
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
burdened with having to um evacuate
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
their house of lead and what this ends
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
up doing is it ends up cutting uh I know
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
landlords that won't rent to to low
 
00:51:58.990 --> 00:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
income because of
 
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
um because of uh them having more kids
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever the situation might be so
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.470 align:start position:0%
how do we
handle

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
handle
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
the the monies that are needed in order
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
houses yes representative wber we have
 
00:52:23.309 --> 00:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
here a bill that has nothing to do with
 
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
remediation of lead paint in housing
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
stock so I I would submit that we
 
00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps ought to and that would be non-
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
gerine to this bill so I I think I
 
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
wonder if it would be better
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
to stay within the four corners of the
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
pages representative King uh do you want
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
to clarify what you're trying to get out
 
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
there's we're just compounding the
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
problem uh if so if if we're going to
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
pass this bill or uh reject the bill I
 
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
think we need to understand what some of
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
the consequences are and so I would you
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
know I think we need to address that
 
00:53:13.839 --> 00:53:17.710 align:start position:0%
know I think we need to address that
long

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.309 --> 00:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
term no objection okay um I'll take a
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
stab at this um I liken and I made
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
reference to this in my testimony I
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
liken this to um our problem with pasas
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
in marac um we don't know it's there
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
until we test once we test we have a
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
problem that needs to be remediated
 
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.109 align:start position:0%
problem that needs to be remediated
you're

00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
right the cost of that is falling on to
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
the residents of marac and I would
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
assume the cost in a private home would
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
fall upon the parents and I can't
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
imagine any parent who has identified in
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
a problem that would severely impact the
 
00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
health of their child not taking action
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
you also mentioned uh
 
00:54:05.789 --> 00:54:05.799 align:start position:0%
landlords if a res if a renter lives in
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
a a house let's say or a piece of
 
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:10.799 align:start position:0%
property and it has been proven to have
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
lead and the landlord does not address
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
that issue I would I would suggest
 
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.789 align:start position:0%
that issue I would I would suggest
that's

00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions okay
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank

education Advocates last session on a
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
similar Bill HB 342 uh to improve lead
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
testing rates while reducing the impact
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
on schools and child care facilities
 
00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
blood testing is a is critically
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
important to ensure the the health of
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire as the only
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
way to know if a child is poisoned by
 
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
lead is through a blood lead test the

Bill's intent is to bring awareness and
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
provide educational opportunities to
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
parents on the importance of blood lead
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
testing any amount of blood any excuse
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
me any amount of lead in a child's blood
 
00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
is dangerous and can cause Health
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
cognitive impairment and behavioral
 
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
problems these health effects are more
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
harmful to young children because their
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
bodies are still developing and growing
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
young children often put their hands or
 
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
other objects like toys which may be
 
00:56:21.549 --> 00:56:21.559 align:start position:0%
contaminated with lead dust into their
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
mouths so they're more likely to be
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.029 --> 00:56:31.039 align:start position:0%
children by testing at ages one and two
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
parents and health care providers can
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
learn if mitigation strategies are
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
needed to reduce further exposure prior
 
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
to negative health effects understate

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
required to have blood Le level tests at
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
age one and again at age two the
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%

level testing for children ages 3 to six
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
who have not been tested at ages 1 and

and the American Academy of Pediatrics
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic children for elevated blood
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%

Department's lead exposure data brief in
 
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
2021 5,000
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
360 fewer children had blood Le tests
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
completed since
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
2019 this was largely due to the
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic and a nationwide
 
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
recall of in-office blood Le testing
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
supplies this represented 25 a 25% drop
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the number of children tested in New
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for blood lead levels since
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
2019 I'd just like to note that similar
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
efforts have already been established uh
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
in the City of Claremont The Claremont
 
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
School Board instituted a policy in 2017
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
that required both the one and the
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
two-year-old blood blood level tests be
 
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
documented on the physical examination
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
form for entry to prek and kindergarten
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
could you start wrapping up please yes
 
00:58:16.589 --> 00:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to provide
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
this testimony the department
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
appreciates the sponsors uh support for
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
improving blood blood testing rates but
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
we also understand that schools May have
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
competing responsibilities and I'd just
 
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
like to note that the department can
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
help schools in daycares with any
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
educational materials that um this bill
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
may may require and and I'd be happy to
 
00:58:38.109 --> 00:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you
 
00:58:38.119 --> 00:58:39.470 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:43.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is there any
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
update on what's happened with the uh
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
lead testing machines they were recalled
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
have they been replace do we know it yes
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is is that the
 
00:58:56.029 --> 00:58:56.039 align:start position:0%
machines themselves weren't involved in
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
the recall it was the materials that are
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
used uh to uh collect the sample and a
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
lot of that was like some of the
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
Plastics material so my understanding is
 
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
yes that's all been resolved and so the
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
recall so the machines are still
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
effective and can be used with the new
 
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
um supplies Supply kits representative
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
Lon um thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
you very much for being here with
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
information uh my question is regarding
 
00:59:23.789 --> 00:59:23.799 align:start position:0%
the more population Health surveillance
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
that was referenced by the prime sponsor
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill is the department looking
 
00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799 align:start position:0%
to have information so they can locate
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
areas where there are children who have
 
00:59:34.829 --> 00:59:34.839 align:start position:0%
a higher blood level concentrations yes
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
we do on an annual basis we put out the
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
lead data brief the Department issues a
 
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
lead data brief we are due the 2022 lead
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
data brief has been uh slightly delayed
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
due to um we had a um a staffing issue
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of Staffing uh shortage so we
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
are working on that and we'll have that
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
new le data brief the numbers that I
 
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:58.039 align:start position:0%
provided in my testimony are from the
 
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
2021 Le data brief and it will be shared
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
with all the 2022 data brief will be
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
shared with all of you once the
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
department has finalized it and issued
 
01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
it follow follow up um thank you and as
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
a followup are you looking for the
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
schools and the daycare providers to
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
provide the information on um student
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
testing rates and um how many of them
 
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
high have high blood levels obviously on
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
a personal data data neutral basis but
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
are you looking to get this information
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
from these providers no we we
 
01:00:29.789 --> 01:00:29.799 align:start position:0%
automatically get the information from
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh providers either medical providers or
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
Laboratories that's required to be
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
submitted to the department as part of
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
our blood Le surveillance uh system so
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
we get that information uh automatically
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
in my understanding when I read the
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
language of the bill there's no
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
requirements for schools or daycares to
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
submit that information to the
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
department that would be redundant
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
because we already get that my
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is the the goal of the
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
bill is to to um where schools you know
 
01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
where schools are working with families
 
01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:01.039 align:start position:0%
sort of on the ground it gets an
 
01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity if a child has not been
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
tested it gets an opportunity to provide
 
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
education to the parents on the
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
importance of blood blood testing so
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding as the as I read I
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
read the bill um and I also notice that
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
in the bill uh for schools um on line 10
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill it does say uh ages six and
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
under and that's also that's for public
 
01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
schools and then on line 26 of the bill
 
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
it's also aged one and 1 to six years
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
questions I'm saying no other questions
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
much no one else has signed up to
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
testify on house build 1068 does anyone
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
else wish to
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.150 align:start position:0%
else wish to

01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else I'm going to close
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%

suicide of Mr Banu earlier today from um
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
um IR intractable pain um it's sad
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a story that happens over
 
01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
and over again um I am going to deviate
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit from the script that I gave
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
you because this morning when I woke up
 
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
at 5:30 um I realized that you might not
 
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
even know what the opioid abatement
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund is do you does anybody okay
 
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
um so I'll just as a beginning um I'm a
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
physician as you know I'm also a
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative last I checked uh I
 
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
specialize in physical medicine and
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation pain management and
 
01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
acupuncture and I've done this for over
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
over 35 years my credentials are on the
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
rest of the testimony I don't want to go
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
over those in detail you can read them
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
for yourselves um you all have heard
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
them before um what I have done is
 
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
advocated for the rights of people in
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
pain for over 30 years focusing on the
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
stigmatized and disenfranchised and
 
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
trying to change the way we perceive
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
judge and treat
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
pain um in a s I have the heavy burden
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
today of of representing the 66 million
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
people who suffer from chronic pain the
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
1.5 million in hospice care every year
 
01:04:29.309 --> 01:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
who suffer with pain too often with
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
their needs unmet um because of
 
01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunate public policies over the
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
last couple years and 50 million people
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
who have surgery this year who require
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
opioids for care of their surgery and
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
the unknown tens of millions of people
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
every year that will have moderate to
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
severe pain I've also been told that I
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
can um state that I'm representing the
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
United States pain foundation and I also
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire pain
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
collaborative in this
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.349 align:start position:0%
collaborative in this
endeavor

01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
endeavor
 
01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
so what's the opioid abatement trust
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
fund so this is my cynical look at a lot
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
of things um whenever there's a crisis
 
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
um and this is a direct reference to a
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
South Park episode which was referenced
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
on the house floor previously whenever
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
there's a crisis it's critical we find
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
one entity to blame no matter the
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
culpability of others um the reasons for
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
the opioid crisis were
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
complex um I think we one of the largest
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
reasons is we do a rotten job in our
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
country of managing pain and treating
 
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
people in pain that dates back to the
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
Harrison Act of
 
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
1914 um that act um was as a result of
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
an opioid crisis that happened at that
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
time the net result of that based on
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
subsequent Supreme Court interpretations
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
is that people in pain were vilified
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
looked as people as a character flaw
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
addiction became a crime and Physicians
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
that had dared to prescribe any pain
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
medicine for patients were then viewed
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
as criminals that that La that the
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
results of that still last to today
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
um um in the mid1 1980s after nearly a
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
century of prohibition we realized that
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
some some some patients with chronic
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
pain and most patients with pain at the
 
01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
end of life can benefit from opioid
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
therapy as part of a balanced
 
01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive integrative care plan
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
somehow unfortunately Society always
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
seeks a Magic Bullet um and opioids
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
became that magic bullet which was not
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
consistent with the message that we were
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
providing in the early ' 880s and '90s
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
and I've been involved in this
 
01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
discussion since the early '90s and '
 
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
80s the media fan the Flames there are a
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
number of Articles covers of newspapers
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
saying that you didn't have to suffer
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
you could just take pain medicine you
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
don't even need to do all those other
 
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
things like exercise psych things
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
anything like that just take a pill and
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
you'd be fine of course they don't
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
accept the blame for that now um um the
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
patients suddenly did not willing to
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
suffer they were not willing they
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
demanded the access to opioids and
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
prescri description Skyrocket and his
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
side effects which were more often than
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
not multifactorial it wasn't merely just
 
01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
taking a pain pill that created the
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
problem it was much more than that also
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
we observed that addicts flocked to this
 
01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
new free source of drug the CDC then
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
declared this as a pandemic using
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
tobacco legislation as a model Justice
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
departments leapt into action focusing
 
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
most of the blame on the pharmaceutical
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
industry despite the culpability of
 
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
others lawsuits were filed and I say
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
under many false pretenses and we I'd be
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
happy to discuss that in Greater detail
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
if you wish the dollars that were subst
 
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
we collected were placed into opioid
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
abat trust funds to be managed state
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
byst state under a series of guidelines
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
created by the
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
settlement my observation from where I
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
sit is that dollars were shifted from
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
those in pain to those um with addiction
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
and my concern about this is that my big
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
effort throughout my life is to create a
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
balance between the needs of both the
 
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
balance shifted we ref refer to that as
 
01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
a pendulum and suddenly one group was
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
being harmed another group was being in
 
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
theory helped um we the chapter on that
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
has yet to be written as to whether
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
see this is my other concern about the
 
01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
process and this is a painful thing for
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
me and this is the first time I'm saying
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
this publicly now I've been told it's
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
safe to do so as part of the process
 
01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
anyone who'd ever received any money
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
from Pharma was called into question
 
01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and professional
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
organizations were hauled into court at
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
substantial cost many going bankrupt in
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
the process um or giving the fight for a
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
worthy cause um seeking to help those in
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
pain my personal story was that when I
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
saw what was going on the myopia of
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
blaming one entity and and and causing
 
01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
harm to people in pain was that I wrote
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
an oped because when I get ticked I
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
write and that's what I did I shared
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
this with a bunch of people and I was
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
informed don't you dare publish this and
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
do not tell anybody what you've done in
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
this state for people in pain because
 
01:09:00.749 --> 01:09:00.759 align:start position:0%
the minute you do they will haul you
 
01:09:03.309 --> 01:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
into court and they will destroy you I
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
saw this over and over and over again I
 
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
I work with the center for practical
 
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:10.759 align:start position:0%
bioethics in Kansas City this
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
organization walks on water they totally
 
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
change the way we as a society deal with
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
the issue of end of life pain they
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
accepted money from Purdue
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical a minor amount they were
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
called into court to justify that money
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
that they received and as a result they
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
nearly went bankrupt it they ended up
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
having to give up any mention of pain in
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
any of their Endeavors that they do even
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
to this date they can't do that because
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
of these settlements and things like
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
that that is really inappropriate the
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
other thing that that concerns me also
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
is that um we weren't able to care for
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
people in pain a number of professional
 
01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
organizations Dr Murphy's an orthopedic
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
surgeon you know that um um um people
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
people that make surgical supplies
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
support all your meetings
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
correct they well who else did
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies do well all of
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
a sudden we lost all that money not only
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
that the American uh pain Society the
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
American acad pain medicine and other
 
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
pain organizations cease to exist
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
because of legal costs because of this
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
process now where do we go to get our
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
education how do we advocate for the
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
rights of people five advocacy
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
organizations cease to exist who
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
advocates for their rights anyways you
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
got me going that's my
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
catharsis um with that said I want to
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
share one story and then I'll get to
 
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
what the gist of the bill is about so
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
there's this gentleman Doug hail um I'm
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
I can say his name because he actually
 
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
his suicide note was actually published
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
in the pain News Network at the at the
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
request of his estate so there's nothing
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you that was not in
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
his suicide note he lived in Vermont on
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire border he re received
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
his primary care in Vermont his
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
Specialty Care in New Hampshire um he
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
had chronic pain from multiple sources
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
for about 20 years and he was on
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
methadone maintenance for that entire
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
period of time because of pressure
 
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
because of public policies not just from
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
the opio abatement issue but from the
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
CDC and other things there's a lot of
 
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
pressure on doctors to not prescribe the
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
doctor that was caring for him I think
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
walked on water I mean he was a bril a
 
01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful man and the only reason I know
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
this was I was asked to testify as an
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
expert witness at a wrongful death suit
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
I reviewed 2500 pages of medical notes
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
um basically um what I found was the
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
doctor did everything right but he was
 
01:11:36.669 --> 01:11:36.679 align:start position:0%
getting so much pressure from other
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
people he finally succumbed and he
 
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
submitted this patient to non-consensual
 
01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.510 align:start position:0%
submitted this patient to non-consensual
dose

01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
dose
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
reduction the patient was then admitted
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
to a a rehab place received a Six-Day
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
detox from 20 years of methadone I will
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
not State publicly what I think about
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
that but that's pretty inappropriate he
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
then went home um within a week he
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't Sur he couldn't deal with it
 
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
and like our Mr Banu took a
 
01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.510 align:start position:0%
and like our Mr Banu took a
gun

01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
gun
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
dead and then the suicide note was found
 
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
later his wife published that in the
 
01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
pain Network news and I it's and
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we hear these stories over
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
and over and over and over again my
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
concerns then becomes is well what do we
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
do about them you know who speaks for
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
them and to me the opio abatement funds
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
I think that I'm really concerned about
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
why they were created I think that blame
 
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
was I'm not saying the pharmaceutical
 
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
industry is Innocent but there's a lot
 
01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
of other blame to go around and and I
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
think to just focus that blame on one
 
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
group is is is not good with that said
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
that money needs to be used for a higher
 
01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
purpose and to me the critical thing
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
that we need to do is balance this
 
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
system when I saw the original bill on
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
that created the opioid abatement
 
01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
commission and the reason I saw it was
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
it was in the Omnibus Bill you all
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
passed during covid my bill that I'd
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
work for five years was in that and when
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
I saw the bill and I looked at it and I
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
saw the serious Omission from anything
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
that had anything to do with people in
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
pain I was like you know what I would
 
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
have voted against the ominous Bill and
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
let my bill die I was so concerned about
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
that so what I wanted to do with this
 
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
bill and being on the opioid abatement
 
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
commission I forgot to tell you I'm the
 
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.270 align:start position:0%
commission I forgot to tell you I'm the
vice

01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
vice
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
um was to try to bring some sort of
 
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
balance so with that said I really
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
respect attorney buffetti he's a really
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
smart guy and he knows the settlements
 
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
backwards forwards sideways and
 
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
everywhere and I do respect his concerns
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm speaking for you here but
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
anyways I do respect his concerns that
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
the money we spend has to respect the
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
opioid settlements that were created um
 
01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
that is actually in a 500 page um um
 
01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
statement please which I have 10 pages
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
here yeah I'm going to read the whole
 
01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
thing but this is exhibit e that
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
outlines what can be used and then this
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
is the John Hopkins primer that's used
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
by state abatement trust fund
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
commissions to decide what they can and
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
they can't use it for so what we did as
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
a group is we created a subcommittee to
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
decide whether the two issues that I
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
have in the bill could be included
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
within this because it's actually not in
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
the Johns Hopkins um primer which kind
 
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
of really surprised me a lot um with
 
01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
that said we went through through it and
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
we did come you're you're going to see
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
the second or the attachment that I gave
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
to you is the primer and on that it
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
actually is the justification from
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
exhibit e as to why these these bills
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
are acceptable so the next question is I
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
really love our committee commission
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
whatever um everybody on it's really
 
01:14:45.149 --> 01:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
wonderful thoughtful everybody has a an
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
addiction story everybody has a pain
 
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
story and we have really great
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
discussions and I trust them thoroughly
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
you know to in consider including things
 
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
like this for example we passed HB 66
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
last year which is representative
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
Merchants bill um that I had something
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
to do with and um we created a uh an
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
alternative to opioids basically pilot
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
program is what we're doing first in the
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
nation maybe to try to find alternative
 
01:15:13.229 --> 01:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
ways to deal with pain that may or may
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
not involve opioids um things like that
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
I think should be funded by the opioid
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
abatement thing because it's both a harm
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
reduction strategy but it's also helpful
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
for people that are being omitted
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
um so that that's what's in there and
 
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
that's why I created this I do have
 
01:15:30.189 --> 01:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
faith but the problem is is that this is
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
a long-term process I think to respect
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
the people that I think that are being
 
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
omitted that a statutory change to
 
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
include these two things that I've added
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
into the 17 current recommendations is
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
important and also because this
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
commission is going to be a moving
 
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
Target it's not always going to be the
 
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
same the priorities are going to change
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
and that's why we created the
 
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:53.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and why we we've created
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
discussions is to try to formalize what
 
01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
we think are priorities for this money
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's pretty much all I
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
have to say I probably went over five
 
01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
minutes and um um but I'd be happy
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor we give extra time to I know I
 
01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
know I'd be happy to take any questions
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Nagel
 
01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.070 align:start position:0%

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
Weber as I hear it and I will just say
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
that I am somebody who looked after
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
somebody with tractable pain for four
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
years uh as my husband died of prostate
 
01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.870 align:start position:0%
years uh as my husband died of prostate
cancer

01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
um what I am wrestling with here is and
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
I have not had time to read all those
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
materials obviously but it my
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
understanding of the opioid abatement
 
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
fund was always that it
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
addressed that the point of it was
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
always to
 
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.870 align:start position:0%
always to
address

01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
the addiction side of things rather than
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
the pain control side of things and I I
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
I understand your your point about the
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
pendulum and what we have done to
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
patients who are in
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
pain but I'm hoping that have the
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
materials that you have given us pointed
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
specifically to where in the settlement
 
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
it allows these things to be used for
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
this purpose because it seems to be a
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
radical departure from my understanding
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
of the opioid abatement fund that is a
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
really very intuitive and wonderful
 
01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
question and it's something that we
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
wrestled with a lot especially in my
 
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and me personally because
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
this obviously an important issue to me
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
um this is the John's Hopkins primer
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
I'll throw it of you of an airplane and
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
you can read the whole thing in three
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
minutes but basically what it does is it
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
outlines the priorities and you guys
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
I've already been informed that you guys
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
are getting sick of hearing about harm
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
reduction but um but there's there's a
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
number of techniques that are being used
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
for opioid abatement so basic you know
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
one of them is prevention and and that's
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
probably the one element of the O entire
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement trust nationally that
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
people are kind of ignoring because
 
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
we're really weak on
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
prevention I would argue and and and and
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
and you when you look through what I
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
wrote you will see the justification
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
based on exist for what I'm proposing
 
01:18:29.629 --> 01:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
like we need data on on on on how many
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
PE people have chronic pain why they
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
commit suicide um I will tell you right
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
now that a lot of the data that you're
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
hearing is totally misguided for example
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
we hear that 12 million people per year
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
suffer from um or have opio misuse
 
01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
opioids um what's kind of Forgotten in
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
that discussion is 70% of them are
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
treating a problem that they're not um
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
receiving care for so to me um
 
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
prevention includes well how do we
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
include them into the process we know
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
that comprehensive integrative Services
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
work to prevent opioid use in people
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
with pain so why don't we pay for that
 
01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
you know why don't we explore that I
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
mean the HB 66 I think was an incredibly
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
novel way to try to do that and try to
 
01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
prevent people from turning to opioids
 
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
and when people don't receive opioids on
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
the Street and I've said this in the
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
committee before and I will say it again
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
if you don't treat somebody with pain
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
and I had an 83-year-old lady come up to
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
me once and tell me I'm 83 years old
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
I've lived a full life I don't need to
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
suffer I will go to the street and I
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
will buy my perco set there and I looked
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
at her and I said well that's not a
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
great way to do it but we as a society
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
turn people to the streets so I have
 
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
patients now that are getting fentanyl
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
tinged opioids from the street and dying
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
so to me finding better strategies to
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
deal with the pain at its base is a
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
preventative strategy that I did justify
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
by using exhibit e um and the other big
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
group that we have to deal with are the
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
opioid refugees people that were being
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
managed just
 
01:20:13.629 --> 01:20:13.639 align:start position:0%
fine and then all of a sudden don't have
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
access to care because their doctors are
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
afraid to prescribe to them so what do
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
they do they die they go to the street
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
or they suffer and that's not really
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
fair to them but when they go to the
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
street what happens personally I was
 
01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
told that we can't do that because um
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
you know well we can't this thing
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't deal with giving drugs to people
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know to treat their pain I I I
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to create an mat type program for
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
people like that that is in my
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations um well I said well we
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
give opioids to people on mat all the
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
time buper Norine methadone we do it all
 
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
the time so what's the difference now
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're actually treating a problem not an
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
addiction we're deing a pain problem not
 
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
an addiction problem to me it's the same
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
thing they end up in the same place does
 
01:21:01.149 --> 01:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
that answer your question it does
 
01:21:01.159 --> 01:21:02.229 align:start position:0%
that answer your question it does
representative

01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
you representative Nel for taking the
 
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
question I do occur that the intent of
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
the opiate abatement was to deal with
 
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
addiction but it reminds me of an
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
analogy someone shared with me before it
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
was kind of like a bathtub filled with
 
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
water if you try to figure out how to
 
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
drain the bathtub if you look at what's
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
going out we need to be cognitive of
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
that which is back to treating the
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
addiction to minimize what's in there at
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
the same time though I think we have a
 
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
need to minimize the amount of water
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
going into the bathtub which is the ones
 
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
who now become addicted because of
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
mismanagement because they go to
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
something along opiates can you speak to
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
the issue of that dichotomy where on one
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
side of the coin you want to stop the
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
issue of addiction
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
but you also want to control or try to
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
addicted I mean when I it's really weird
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I learned on the
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement commission is if you
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
look at the percentage of people who are
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
homeless the percentage of people are
 
01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated have a substance use
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
disorder it's roughly 75 to 80% that was
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
like a shocking number to me so you know
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
one of the thoughts was well let's treat
 
01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
it in the prison and I says well why
 
01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
don't we prevent it before they get get
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
to the prison so a lot of people have
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know on the committee this you know
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
I thought $300 million is a lot of money
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
I mean you know I I I I have that in my
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
car right now which is in my suit coat
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's actually in my car sorry but um
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know $300 million I thought was a
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
lot of money then I found out it's
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
really not a lot of money when you're
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with a problem that that's this
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
big but so we all have our points of
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
view well how do we you know spend that
 
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
and to me when I looked at that
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
statistic alone it really struck me that
 
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
we really need to focus us on prevention
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
and um and how you do that in an
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
evidence-based way which is one of the
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
requirements of the statute is is where
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
things get complex I mean what
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
preventative strategies have evidence
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
base and but at the same point it's
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
important we need to look at that and to
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
me treating people in pain if we think
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
that they were the Genesis of the opioid
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
problem in the first place why wouldn't
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
we want to do whatever we can do to
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
prevent them from going on opioids in
 
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
the first place so why don't we provide
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensive integrative programs as
 
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
oppos to just pills and procedures and
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
tell them you know what this pill or
 
01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
this procedure will work it'd be fine
 
01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't we know it doesn't so why
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
don't we spend our money there that's my
 
01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.430 align:start position:0%
don't we spend our money there that's my
opinion

01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr jar and thank you
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
for taking the question the followup
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
question is that in the house bill 66
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
when we had the meetings one of the
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
things we learned from the industry
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
itself was a desire to find
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
Solutions but one of the issues they ran
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
into is as a private for-profit
 
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
organization is the risk of Financial
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
Risk so therefore it's one of those
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
things where I think where the
 
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:03.560 align:start position:0%
government at times can be very helpful
 
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
is taking some of the Financial Risk on
 
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
a pilot program in order to show that
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
something works therefore it does become
 
01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
something the industry could adopt
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
because they don't have to get into the
 
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
Financial Risk and you speak to that for
 
01:24:19.629 --> 01:24:19.639 align:start position:0%
me please you don't want me to talk for
 
01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
hours on that one um
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's a long discussion I mean in 1975
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
Milton Friedman said that the practice
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
of medicine was a monopoly period and
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
that it should be subject to Monopoly
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
regulation um how we spend money in
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
medicine is too often dependent on who
 
01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
has the power and where that money goes
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
um people in comprehensive integrative
 
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
programs typically don't have that level
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
of power they don't generate a lot of
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue and therefore it's hard for us
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
to make those kinds of decisions which
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
is why I proposed very publicly in my
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
book that we need to turn the practice
 
01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
of Health Care upside down and focus on
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
how we deal with issues of managing
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
problems preventing problems especially
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
substance to use pain um disability
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
things like that I mean
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
there's that's my nutshell of an answer
 
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
but right now we have a system that
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
functions against that um you know you
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
know who controls the power in in
 
01:25:23.629 --> 01:25:23.639 align:start position:0%
healthcare everybody knows that and
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's got to change if it doesn't
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
change then everything we're doing is a
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
waste of time but I think this is not a
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
waste of time for me
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
personally representative
 
01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:37.119 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
you um for taking this question and I
 
01:25:41.629 --> 01:25:41.639 align:start position:0%
realized I came in late so I may be
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
putting my foot in my mouth um so it it
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
appears to me that what this bill does
 
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
is it adds at least one category or a
 
01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
broader category of things that the um
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
commission can respond to with grants of
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
money so it's
 
01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
um it's adding it's not taking away
 
01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
anything and um and I I heard you get
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
your um what I thought was a brilliant
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
explanation of why this is part of
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
prevention um which is already in um
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
which is already one of the categories
 
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
so could you just explain to to me um a
 
01:26:25.709 --> 01:26:25.719 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
about you know less less PE lest people
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
think that well now all the money will
 
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
go into this versus going into um um
 
01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
medically assisted treatment or or um
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
other kinds of
 
01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
um harm reduction whatever harm
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
reduction is um how does the commission
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
make decisions about how many grants or
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
how much money will be given to to this
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
area and how many how much will be given
 
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
to this area um can we be assured that
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
there's going to still be uh you know a
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
very broad view of of how this large
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
amount of money which is not as large as
 
01:27:09.149 --> 01:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
we thought can be used that's a really
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
great question and and again I I'm gonna
 
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
I know we don't always agree on stuff
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
but attorney buffetti is the expert on
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
that so maybe he can ask answer that too
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
but I'll give you my answer so um you
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
know it's a lot of money
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
the first step is you have to ask for it
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
once somebody's asked for it and the
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
process by doing that very state by
 
01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
state our state has a very specific way
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
other states do it differently but once
 
01:27:37.149 --> 01:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
the money is asked for then it goes into
 
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
the committee and then the committee I
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
don't even remember how many people are
 
01:27:43.709 --> 01:27:43.719 align:start position:0%
on it's a fairly large group um um you
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
know we we it may get submitted to a sub
 
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which is what I saw the
 
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
first time and then they make
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations the committee as a whole
 
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
whether they think it's a good idea or
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
not and then based on and whether it
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
also the critical thing does it fall
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
within the guidelines because if it
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't then it you know we we risk
 
01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
losing money if if we give money away
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's not within the guidelines so the
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
committee votes yes or no if the
 
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
committee votes yes then the next step
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
is it has to go to the governor's
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other DRS
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
drugs and and several people from that
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
are on the committee the commission as
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
well and then if they accept it then it
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
goes to the executive Council then the
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
executive Council has to approve it so
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's extremely complicated process in
 
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
other states they don't do it that way
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement commission has
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
total control I think 12 states do it
 
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
that way most of the states that
 
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
actually have commissions will will do
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
it the way I just described so it's very
 
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
diff it's a complicated process and it's
 
01:28:44.669 --> 01:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
very time consuming so you know I was
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
told and I and I really respect this
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
that um that you know we believe that
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
right now we have we don't need the leg
 
01:28:55.109 --> 01:28:55.119 align:start position:0%
legislation because we can do this um I
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
am not at all convinced that that's true
 
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:01.639 align:start position:0%
I what I would like to see is that um
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
that these two things be included as
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
potentials but they're not going to
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
overwhelm all the other things you know
 
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
at all um and despite the vote in the
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
house the other day harm reduction
 
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
actually is one of the the um
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
criteria thank you um before I call on
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative Weber um obviously we're
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
running behind but yeah I'm sorry uh
 
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
other other questions after
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative Weber maybe we could
 
01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
defer to a regular committee meeting
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
because obviously we have the prime
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
witness right here uh and we'll have
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
read readily available access but go
 
01:29:37.109 --> 01:29:37.119 align:start position:0%
ahead representative
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
Weber before I ask my question could I
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
also ask you a procedural thing sure uh
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%
which is that I'm certainly finding that
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
I would need more time to think about
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
this question because um
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
the witness has brought up a number of
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
things that I hadn't thought about
 
01:29:59.470 --> 01:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
before so I'm wondering if if we can
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
make up time by by not exing it today I
 
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
I know that it's on for exec today but I
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to express my own feeling
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
that it's a more complicated subject
 
01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:17.719 align:start position:0%
than I than I thought so um I just offer
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
that as a suggestion I don't know how
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
other people feel but I'm I'm certainly
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
feeling that way so with that if I could
 
01:30:26.109 --> 01:30:26.119 align:start position:0%
ask my question which
 
01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
is um given that number 15 which is
 
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
already in
 
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
here um about evidencebased and
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and evidence and formed
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
primary secary and tertiary prevention
 
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
programs and services including efforts
 
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
to promote Healthy Lifestyles reduce
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
isolation build skills resilience and
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
facilitate community-based Prov
 
01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.669 align:start position:0%
facilitate community-based Prov
prevention

01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
efforts when we're talking about
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts isn't isn't this
 
01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
already in
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
there um to answer that question um I I
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
um I have not read the minutes of every
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
commission meeting I've been on the
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
commission for a little over a year but
 
01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
what became quite apparent to me and um
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
again attorney buetti can correct me if
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong because I may very well be but
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
um the issue of using these funds to
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
address the issues I've raised today has
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
never been brought up and and be and
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
that is why my concern was that these
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
two issues would not be included under
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
that category of 15 when I first started
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
um I said oh boy this is great if we get
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
harm reduction in there and we used 15
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
which was actually added also um with
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
those two things I thought that was good
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
enough but then it became quite apparent
 
01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
to me in some of the committee dis
 
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
commission discussions we've had it it
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't and that's why I felt it was was
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to take this extra step do I
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
have faith that our current group would
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
approve representative Merchant's
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
brilliant idea program um I think that
 
01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
they would certainly consider it but in
 
01:32:07.149 --> 01:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
five years a different commission may
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
important okay um again other questions
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh we we will continue this we won't
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
execute today uh representative Weber
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
makes a good point and clearly this a
 
01:32:24.669 --> 01:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
lot of um it's a complex Bill and a lot
 
01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
of uh concern about it
 
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
so um just one quick statement um
 
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy would appreciate
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
this but most doctors um try to clate
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
Simplicity out of complexity physiatrist
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
try to create complexity out of
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
simplicity so I just did that for you
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right um with that uh I think
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
we're all set representative Nagel if
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
you want
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
to um step down and also signed up to
 
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
speak today is Attorney James buffetti
 
01:33:09.629 --> 01:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
Justice I I don't good morning and
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
usually what we do attorney beretti is
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
it's three minutes for Testimony after
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor but obviously you can
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
take questions and hopefully we'll
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
address through that process if there's
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
any additional comments fine um thank
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
you uh for the record my name is James
 
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
buffetti I am the deputy attorney
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
general uh since 2014 I have been the
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
state's lead prosecutor in all of its uh
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
opioid litigation I'm also a member of
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement
 
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
commission um so the opioid abatement
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
trust fund if you read the statute it it
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
contains all of the settlement funds
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
from uh from judgments against opioid
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and Distributors there
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
were multiple cases brought by the state
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
and multiple settlements against a whole
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
variety of opioid manufacturers and
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
opioid um
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
U other companies that that are doing
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
this in total uh I think we will receive
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
over 18 years about $300 million which
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
is for the purpose of opioid abatement
 
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
and so opioid abatement this this money
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
is designed and limited to opioid
 
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
abatement which is to provide treatment
 
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
resources to people who are suffering
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
from opioid use disorder to prevent
 
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
people from dying of opioid overdoses
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
and to uh to address what in New
 
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was a very significant problem
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
at one point New Hampshire was um the
 
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
the second highest overdose rate uh per
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
capita in the country after West
 
01:34:57.790 --> 01:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
Virginia and so we have spent a lot of
 
01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
time addressing it these settlements are
 
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
designed to uh to deal with opioid
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
abatement and and not anything else and
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
in fact that if we did something outside
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
of opioid abatement we would jeopardize
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
These funds going
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
forward so here's my concern my concern
 
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
language of this stat of this bill is uh
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
is open to a lot of interpretation and
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
is somewhat vague it talks about
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
increasing access I'm not sure if it's
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
increasing access to
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
opioids uh but it talks about those who
 
01:35:43.629 --> 01:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
have who have um who who been were
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
subject to non-consensual dose
 
01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
reduction to the extent that this
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
language could be interpreted as as
 
01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:55.159 align:start position:0%
increasing the supply of opioids that
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
would be completely contrary to the
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
purposes of these funds and I'm here to
 
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
tell you that that would jeopardize the
 
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
the the ongoing receipt of these funds
 
01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
these funds are limited by settlements
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
that have been approved by courts
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
including bankruptcy courts many of
 
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
these companies file bankruptcy and
 
01:36:17.629 --> 01:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
there are there were limitations in the
 
01:36:21.629 --> 01:36:21.639 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy orders um so but two to the
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
extent that that the the that this bill
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
is intending to to
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
deal with uh with issues like treatment
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
and withdrawal Services I would say that
 
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at the existing statute all
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
that stuff is already there and that we
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't we don't need this bill if you
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
look at 126 um uh
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
a86 the statute currently talks about uh
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
medications for substance use disorder
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
abstinence-based treatment treatment and
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
Recovery it talks about emergency
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
response Services related to opioid use
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
disorder it talks about talks about um
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
withdrawal Management Services about FDA
 
01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
approved opioid reversal agents it talks
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
about H reduction programs and it talks
 
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
about efforts to prevent
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
overprescribing to ensure appropriate
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
prescribing and dispensing of opioids
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
through evidence-based and other uh
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
evidence informed programs or strategies
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
I mean his here's the reality you know
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
and start wrapping up I've been involved
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
in these cases uh and we've we've
 
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
heavily litigated these cases against
 
01:37:31.870 --> 01:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
puru Johnson and Johnson malen crot
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
other companies there's overwhelming
 
01:37:36.669 --> 01:37:36.679 align:start position:0%
evidence that the reason that we're in
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
the situation that we are it was a was a
 
01:37:40.159 --> 01:37:41.629 align:start position:0%
the situation that we are it was a was a
grossly

01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
grossly
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
overprescribing of opioids it was a
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
culture that was created by Purdue
 
01:37:49.229 --> 01:37:49.239 align:start position:0%
pharmer and other companies to encourage
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
doctors to prescribe opioids for
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
everything and if you look at the
 
01:37:56.109 --> 01:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
evidence the evidence is that these
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
companies flooded New Hampshire with
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
opioids and that we had so many opioids
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
that that we we we we uh were subject to
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
the the uh the uh misuse and the
 
01:38:11.589 --> 01:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
overdose rates that we've seen so so to
 
01:38:13.229 --> 01:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
the extent that this bill is in any way
 
01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
interpreted as saying that that we can
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
use it to provide more opioids to people
 
01:38:21.550 --> 01:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
we are going to run into problems going
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
forward with these settlements thank you
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
very much any questions representative
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
Lon um thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
you for being here with this information
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
we would love to have you on some of the
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
others when we were talking about
 
01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
spending this settlement money um so my
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
question for you is regarding the fact
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
that patients who are at either
 
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
certainly facing end of life or without
 
01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate care will unfortunately
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
become end of life and they're being
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
denied opiates when they have something
 
01:38:53.229 --> 01:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
like say a softball siiz abscess that is
 
01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
reached into their bone and they're
 
01:38:58.270 --> 01:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
intractable pain and because of all of
 
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
the efforts surrounding this they are
 
01:39:03.149 --> 01:39:03.159 align:start position:0%
not on an opioid that would relieve that
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
pain and allow their body to recover but
 
01:39:06.589 --> 01:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
are instead on something like
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
Tramadol um I'm trying to understand how
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
the Mis it's a misuse of opioid and it's
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
not NE it's it would be outside of the
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
scope of this in order to ensure that
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
those people who quite honestly if they
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
survive long enough to have an addiction
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
problem are probably a success story but
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
instead we're trying to make sure that
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
they're not dying in a Agony how that
 
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
would be contrary to these settlements
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
well first of all um doctors are
 
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
perfectly free to prescribe opioids this
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
these cases have never been about not
 
01:39:39.149 --> 01:39:39.159 align:start position:0%
prescribing opioids this has been the
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
overprescribing of opioids for chronic
 
01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
pain patients not for end of life
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
patients C breakthrough cancer pain
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
patients so they can they can still
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
prescribe what they need to and I am not
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
not unsympathetic to what Dr Nagel is
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
talking about all I'm here to say is
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
that you can't use this money for that
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
purpose they may be other programs that
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
should be used to to to to support those
 
01:40:06.589 --> 01:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
efforts but that's not what this money
 
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
was intended for so it's not really
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
question of is this right and is this
 
01:40:13.589 --> 01:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
wrong the question is can you use this
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
money for this purpose and I think the
 
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
answer is no that you can't if if it's
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
if it's for the The increased Supply if
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
you if the money is used to purchase
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
more opioids to provide more opioids to
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
patients who may very well need it you
 
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
can't use this money for that
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
purpose followup um thank you and as a
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
followup um respectfully doctors are
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
being essentially prohibited from
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
prescribing opioids in those groups do
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
you think that c that pre preventing
 
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
that harm is is outside of the scope
 
01:40:50.109 --> 01:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
well I I don't I'd be interesting in a
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up conversation with you maybe
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
outside of this room as to who is
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
preventing doctors from prescribing
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
opioids for end of life care or
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
breakthrough pant a cancer pain pain uh
 
01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
I I I'm not aware of that that was never
 
01:41:06.189 --> 01:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
the target of these cases ever so if
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's happening that's a question that
 
01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
should be raised maybe with with other
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
with the Board of Medicine and with
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
others I'm not aware of that and that
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
frankly shouldn't be happening because
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's not what the purpose of all these
 
01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.470 align:start position:0%
that's not what the purpose of all these
lawsuits

01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
was represent
 
01:41:25.229 --> 01:41:25.239 align:start position:0%
Weber I believe representative Merchant
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
was I'm line before me thank you thank
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and also thank you
 
01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
attorney Petty for taking my question
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to my analogy about the
 
01:41:39.149 --> 01:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
bathtub and what I'm trying to get to is
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
that this tremendous amount of focus
 
01:41:43.629 --> 01:41:43.639 align:start position:0%
based upon this conversation I'm trying
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
to drain the bathtu and talking about
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
addiction which I totally think is
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
important but we're not at all beginning
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
to wrestle with the issue with water
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
going in the bathtub and that gets back
 
01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
into the issue of trying to find ways to
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
help patients not have to use opiates
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
and if we don't find a way to do that
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do because
 
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately that's the easy way it's a
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
silver bullet it's cheap it's
 
01:42:09.629 --> 01:42:09.639 align:start position:0%
inexpensive but we don't have any
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
alternatives we haven't been able to
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
document it so help me understand about
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
funds trying to use the funds in a way
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
to prevent water coming into the bathtub
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
just for f using on the water going out
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
of the bathtub well the the the current
 
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
statute absolutely allows for prevention
 
01:42:30.669 --> 01:42:30.679 align:start position:0%
to prevent people from from from using
 
01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
opioids in the first instance if if the
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
commission wants to fund a program for
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
that in the schools or in in any place
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
else we C that's certainly within the
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
Gambit of how these opioids monies uh
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
should be used and how they were
 
01:42:47.639 --> 01:42:49.750 align:start position:0%
should be used and how they were
intended

01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
intended
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:53.350 align:start position:0%
intended
followup

01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
you talk about
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
prevention but at the same time and I'll
 
01:42:59.310 --> 01:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
go back to I think what the settlement
 
01:43:01.629 --> 01:43:01.639 align:start position:0%
was about I wasn't there obviously I
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't the attorney was inappropriate
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
prescribing of opius not that opius
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have a place it's a question of
 
01:43:12.270 --> 01:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
utilizing them inappropriately what
 
01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish by having
 
01:43:17.229 --> 01:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
funds from the opiate abatement program
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
is to allow for us to create the
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
environment that allows for appropriate
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
prescribing of opiates but at the same
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
time allow for people to get
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
alternatives to opiates so I don't
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
understand where the objections coming
 
01:43:34.109 --> 01:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
from because within what I'm hearing
 
01:43:36.189 --> 01:43:36.199 align:start position:0%
that's within the context of what we're
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
talking about all this bill does is
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
clarifies it does it not frankly I'm not
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
sure what this bill does and that's my
 
01:43:47.589 --> 01:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
concern the language is not clear if it
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
would allow here's my only concern and I
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
think we could work on language with Dr
 
01:43:53.470 --> 01:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
Nel here's my only concern to the extent
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
that the language would allow for funds
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
to be used to increase the supply of
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
opioids to provide opioids to patients
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
that I think would run against the
 
01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.030 --> 01:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
statute just I just want to be clear
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
that you keep using the word I keep
 
01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
hearing the word increasing opiates what
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing sort
 
01:44:20.189 --> 01:44:20.199 align:start position:0%
of silently in that comment is the fact
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
is we don't want opiates period and
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's totally different than
 
01:44:25.709 --> 01:44:25.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate prescribing of opiates so I
 
01:44:27.589 --> 01:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that we're down the
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
road of appropriate prescribing not
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
inappropriate prescribing so is that my
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of what you were trying to
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
communicate here so the statute already
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
provides for appropriate prescribing uh
 
01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
so no I'm not saying that that no opioid
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
we've never said that opioids have no
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
use in treatment of pain but and this
 
01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
case is not about overprescribing this
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
case was about unfair and decep ceptive
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
business practices by the opioid
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who then flooded our
 
01:44:58.270 --> 01:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
communities with opioids flooded them
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
and so that's what this is about this
 
01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
was never geared toward the prescribers
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
the prescribers were fed a bunch of
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
false information from the opioid
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who told them that these
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
drugs were safe effective and
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
non-addictive when they knew that was a
 
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
lie and they and they went to doctors
 
01:45:17.149 --> 01:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
over and over again sometimes three
 
01:45:19.589 --> 01:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
times a week and fed them a bunch of
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
Lies and so they got caught in their
 
01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
lies and they paid dear some of them
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
went to bankruptcy they paid dear for I
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
mean billions of dollars because what
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
they were doing was clearly a violation
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
of consumer protection acts they were
 
01:45:36.270 --> 01:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
deceiving people and thinking these
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
drugs were safe effective and
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
non-addictive for chronic pain patients
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
and that was not
 
01:45:45.629 --> 01:45:45.639 align:start position:0%
true representative Weber well as a as a
 
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
followup both I think to representative
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
Merchant and also I think to
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative leyon and
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
recognizing that um I think many of us
 
01:45:59.790 --> 01:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
have experienced the issue of people
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
with chronic pain who are now are not
 
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
able to get treated so that's and
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
irrespective of how we got here the
 
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
question now is what do we do going
 
01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
forward so what I'm wondering
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
is could would you be willing to issue
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
us a legal opinion
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
that passing this is going to contravene
 
01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
the terms of the settlements which are
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
the governing document for the
 
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
funds and what I also seem to hear you
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
saying is with
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
clarification this
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
may be able to be brought within the
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
parameters of the settlement and would
 
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
you be willing to help us by providing
 
01:46:56.830 --> 01:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
US Written guidance as to what could be
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
done within the parameters of the
 
01:47:03.149 --> 01:47:03.159 align:start position:0%
settlement funds in your legal opinion
 
01:47:05.589 --> 01:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
because that's what we don't have the
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
expertise to deal with sure I'm I'm
 
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the with the
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
committee again my point is is a a
 
01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
fairly narrow one it it as long as the
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
language is clear that you couldn't use
 
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
this money to to provide opioids to
 
01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
people you couldn't do that you could do
 
01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
all sorts of other things in terms of
 
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
treatment of pain and alternatives to
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
treatment of pain and getting people off
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
opioids but you couldn't use the money
 
01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
to increase the supply of opioids so
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
none of this language which doesn't
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that directly but it but but
 
01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:42.199 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about how this is
 
01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
interpreted down the road by other
 
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
commissions but if you're talking about
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
increasing access what does that mean uh
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
what it what it in my my opinion what it
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
cannot mean is that we use it to supply
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
opioids to to to to patients who who who
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
needed representative Seth King thank
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Assistant
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
Attorney General for taking questions I
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
I think I actually understand where
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
you're coming from on this um
 
01:48:12.910 --> 01:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it seems like the debate
 
01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
is about the efficacy or legitimacy of
 
01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
opioids when all you're really basically
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
saying if I if I have it understood
 
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
correctly is that um the language of
 
01:48:26.109 --> 01:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't belong in the opioid
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
opioid advisement uh abatement
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
advisement committee advisory committee
 
01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
commission and um but but you you said a
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
a couple times that it really can't be
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
in there and it sounds like there was a
 
01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuit there was litigation there was
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
settlement and to put this language in
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
there would really Contra contravene the
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
whole point of the the lawsuit and the
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
litigation and all that um so my my
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
question is if this were to pass and get
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor do you think this
 
01:49:02.109 --> 01:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
would hold up in court would there be
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
would there be um litigation now to to
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
to over overturn this law and who would
 
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
file that sort of litigation I mean I
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
can't imagine the opioid companies would
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
say oh we need to get rid of this here
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
who who would have to then you know
 
01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
initiate a lawsuit like that and would
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
it would it even hold up in court thank
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question I I don't
 
01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think there would be a lawsuit I
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
think that that these settlements that
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
the the the the receipt of the
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
settlements is contingent upon the AG's
 
01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:35.719 align:start position:0%
office certifying that the that the
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
monies are used for the purposes for
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
which opota baitman is set out for and
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
and again to to try I maybe it's too
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
fine of a point and I'm not doing it
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
well but to but my point is this
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
language may be fine as it is as long as
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's clear that in that increasing
 
01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
access uh to to certain care does not
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
include providing opioids I mean all the
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
rest of it is fine I don't have any
 
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
objection to the language except that is
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
ambiguous and we need to be very clear
 
01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
that that we could not we could not use
 
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
it to to provide opioids to people who
 
01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
needed it that would be completely
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
contrary to the purposes of the statute
 
01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
so what what would happen is that that
 
01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
we we wouldn't be able to certify that
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
this that these funds were being used
 
01:50:27.629 --> 01:50:27.639 align:start position:0%
for that if the commission if the
 
01:50:29.629 --> 01:50:29.639 align:start position:0%
commission saw this if the commission
 
01:50:31.629 --> 01:50:31.639 align:start position:0%
decided yes we're going to actually do
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
this and if it was approved by the
 
01:50:36.669 --> 01:50:36.679 align:start position:0%
governor and executive counsel uh that
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
that was a a a grant that was awarded
 
01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
that actually did that then we could be
 
01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
in a situation where we wouldn't be able
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
to say to the bankruptcy courts and to
 
01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
these other settlement administrators
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
that the money was being used
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
appropriately and that we could
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
jeopardize future receipts of this $300
 
01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:58.149 align:start position:0%
jeopardize future receipts of this $300
million

01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right I think we're well set
 
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney buetti you're
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%

in New Hampshire and quickly transported
 
01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
to Boston for treatment following Max
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%

cause of death by disease in children
 
01:52:57.310 --> 01:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
and that a double pediatric cancer
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
cluster was was discovered in the Sea
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
Coast New Hampshire was noted to be
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
number one in the nation for Pediatric
 
01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
cancer incidents in a report published a
 
01:53:08.350 --> 01:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
few years back we also know that though
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
there may be other causes cancer can be
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
an environmentally triggered chronic
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
disease some of our most vulnerable
 
01:53:18.910 --> 01:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
citizens our children have been likely
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
put at exposure
 
01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
to environmental toxins like PS and
 
01:53:25.709 --> 01:53:25.719 align:start position:0%
other things in our community in our air
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
drinking water and soil Childhood Cancer
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire certainly deserves our
 
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
attention despite the aforementioned New
 
01:53:35.310 --> 01:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not reference Childhood

Cancer in our state cancer action plan
 
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
when she discovered this Amy reached out
 
01:53:43.069 --> 01:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
to ask what we could do to change that
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
HB 393 will amend RSA 126 a87 the State

lives based on their cancer one vet told
 
01:55:14.669 --> 01:55:14.679 align:start position:0%

dying you know who else are our canaries
 
01:55:35.709 --> 01:55:35.719 align:start position:0%
children New Hampshire New Hampshire has
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
the highest rate of pediatric cancer in
 
01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
the United States New Hampshire the
 
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
state of lakes and mountains and yet we
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
are not collecting or classifying
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
important health information
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
this bill corrects that so that we can
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
start identifying and address potential
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
cancer pockets in New Hampshire thank
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%

Hampshire and is there any like trend on
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
for increase of it in the last uh years

no that's the problem we don't have the
 
01:56:29.069 --> 01:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
numbers this bill would correct that so
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
we can start collecting those
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
numbers thank

allowing me to speak today um my name is
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
Amy Mendes this is my son Max um I am a
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
lifelong resident of New Hampshire I am
 
01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
a wife and a nurse but most importantly
 
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
I am a mom um I'm here today to
 
01:57:19.629 --> 01:57:19.639 align:start position:0%
represent all the moms and dads um that
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
have heard the devastating words that
 
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
their child has cancer I first heard
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
those words back in
 
01:57:29.950 --> 01:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
2016 when Max was only six years old and
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
leukemia um we are incredibly fortunate
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
to have been treated down in Boston at
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
Boston Children's Hospital in Dana
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
Farber um max was successfully in his
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
14th month of Chemo when we were
 
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
devastated to find out that he had
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
relapsed um he then went on to endure
 
01:57:58.510 --> 01:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
another 20 months of treatment including
 
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
both chemotherapy and cranial
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
radiation um and two weeks before his
 
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
scheduled end of treatment we found out
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
that he had relapsed
 
01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
again this is where Boston comes into
 
01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
real importance because at this time
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
they were offering treatment um that New
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was not so max was the 12
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
patient to receive ctis Cell Therapy
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
which is a new
 
01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
immunotherapy I see a head
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
shaking um he then received more
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy and full body radiation uh
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
before his bone marrow transplant in
 
01:58:38.669 --> 01:58:38.679 align:start position:0%
January of 2020 and I am happy to say
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
that Max just celebrated his fourth year
 
01:58:40.639 --> 01:58:42.069 align:start position:0%
that Max just celebrated his fourth year
in

01:58:42.069 --> 01:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:58:46.270 --> 01:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
remission I can sit here and rattle off
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
um all the specifics of Max's cancer
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
treatment but but I will never actually
 
01:58:53.709 --> 01:58:53.719 align:start position:0%
be able to articulate um what it is
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
actually like to sit next to a child
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
while they go through cancer um it's
 
01:59:00.669 --> 01:59:00.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely soul
 
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
crushing as a parent your job is
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to protect your child from
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
cancer or protect your child but you
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
can't protect your child from cancer um
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know what is causing this in
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
children um but we do know that the
 
01:59:17.709 --> 01:59:17.719 align:start position:0%
statistics say that 47 kids in the US a
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
day will be diagnosed today today and
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and the next and we know that
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
Childhood Cancer Remains the leading
 
01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
cause of death by disease for our
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
nation's children under the age of 15
 
01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
years I know Nancy had already mentioned
 
01:59:34.350 --> 01:59:34.360 align:start position:0%
that um knowing that Childhood Cancer is
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
not going anywhere anytime soon this is
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
where we can step up and at least arm
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
families and health care providers with
 
01:59:42.990 --> 01:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
the best tools and resources to assist
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
them and this is where the state cancer

action plan comes into
 
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
play adult care is very much centered
 
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
around prevention and education and
 
01:59:54.510 --> 01:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
early detection through screenings and
 
01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics is completely different um we
 
01:59:59.709 --> 01:59:59.719 align:start position:0%
need to educate healthcare workers we
 
02:00:02.830 --> 02:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
need to educate parents and even school
 
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
um resources on the signs and symptoms
 
02:00:08.189 --> 02:00:08.199 align:start position:0%
of cancer in children I was a nurse for
 
02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
10 years and I missed all the signs that
 
02:00:13.629 --> 02:00:13.639 align:start position:0%
my son had cancer I took Max to three
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
different Physicians and they all missed
 
02:00:17.950 --> 02:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
it too providing these tools could mean
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
earlier diagnosis in children and
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
possibly better
 
02:00:23.790 --> 02:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
outcomes um we need to provide families
 
02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:00:29.069 --> 02:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
resources um on how to access good care
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
and this is really only available based
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
on how social workers and case managers
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
have been um provided the resources
 
02:00:41.470 --> 02:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
themselves when you get thrown into
 
02:00:44.910 --> 02:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
pediatric cancer it's absolute chaos and
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
very much of your day is
 
02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
lived moment to moment
 
02:00:49.190 --> 02:00:51.229 align:start position:0%
lived moment to moment
[Music]

02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:00:54.189 --> 02:00:54.199 align:start position:0%
um things that seem easy like a Google
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
search of what's the best treatment and
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
what's the best hospital um or a phone
 
02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
call for assistance or very hard and you
 
02:01:03.149 --> 02:01:03.159 align:start position:0%
become very overwhelmed and this is why
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
you really need to support heavily on
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
these resources in your support
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
network um families need emotional
 
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
supports they need travel and lodging
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
supports they need advocacy and
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
financial supports and these are all
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
tools that could be included
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
um our family lost a lot when Max was
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
sick and that is fine I have him here
 
02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to lose everything for
 
02:01:33.149 --> 02:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
that we went from a two income household
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
to a one income household so that I
 
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
could provide care for Max and we stayed
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
that way for five years um as a result
 
02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
of that we lost our home and we're
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
forced to move in with family then the
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit and my husband lost his job
 
02:01:51.149 --> 02:01:51.159 align:start position:0%
as as well as our health insurance and
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
we were forced to rely solely on State
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
Insurance um as I mentioned earlier Max
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
received CT cell therapy and that was in
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts New Hampshire was not
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
offering that so if that had happened at
 
02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:04.430 align:start position:0%
offering that so if that had happened at
the

02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:06.669 --> 02:02:06.679 align:start position:0%
time that he received that treatment we
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
would not have been able to receive that
 
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
so this is why it's important to allow
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
families to
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
access the health care providers that
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
they deem necessary to treat their
 
02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:20.069 align:start position:0%
they deem necessary to treat their
children

02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
um the average age that an adult is
 
02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with cancer is 66 the average
 
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
age a child is diagnosed is between the
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
age of six and 10 that leaves a long
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
time for side effects to pop
 
02:02:44.109 --> 02:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
up um children are not small adults they
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
are still developing and cancer
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
treatment has lifelong health
 
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
effects Max is is now 14 he has already
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
been diagnosed with cataracts growth
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%

02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
neuropathy anxiety and depression a tick
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
disorder bone growth abnormalities and I
 
02:03:06.589 --> 02:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
could go on um he is at a higher risk
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
for secondary cancers due to his
 
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
treatment and those include other brain
 
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
cancer um other blood cancers brain
 
02:03:15.229 --> 02:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
tumors bone cancer and next year he will
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
be screened yearly for thyroid
 
02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:19.550 align:start position:0%
be screened yearly for thyroid

02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:19.560 align:start position:0%

02:03:24.069 --> 02:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
putting additional supports in place for
 
02:03:26.189 --> 02:03:26.199 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals on how to
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
screen these children as they continue
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
to grow into adulthood is important for
 
02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:33.390 align:start position:0%
to grow into adulthood is important for
these

02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
reasons um another thing that people
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't like to talk about is uh
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
bereavement supports not every child is
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
as lucky as Max we know many families
 
02:03:47.470 --> 02:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
who have unfortunately lost children um
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
and it's nothing anyone likes to discuss
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
but we need to normalize this and put
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
the supports in place um to address
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
these family specific
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
needs thank thank you so much are you
 
02:04:06.109 --> 02:04:06.119 align:start position:0%

you for taking the question and I
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
I as someone who lost a SP house to
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
cancer I know what you went through um
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
of course every Cancer is different but
 
02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I really appre appreciate your C
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
courage Max for coming today and and
 
02:05:02.549 --> 02:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
standing in front of us and hopefully
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
we're not as intimidating as we look um
 
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
I do I do have a question sure
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
um this bill is mainly to
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
prioritize pediatric
 
02:05:20.189 --> 02:05:20.199 align:start position:0%
cancer one of the things I struggle with
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh through losing a wife through through
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
cancer um is are we doing enough to
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
actually find out what uh as U
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant talked about on
 
02:05:35.709 --> 02:05:35.719 align:start position:0%
another bill what's filling the bathtub
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
are we are we looking at what's causing
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
Childhood Cancer is that part of what
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
doing um that I can't answer um enough
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
like I don't have the information on
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
that is that something that I would hope
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
it would work on
 
02:05:55.549 --> 02:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely um I think that's something
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
that the nation struggles with as a
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
whole is figuring out I mean children
 
02:06:01.629 --> 02:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
obviously six-year-olds aren't smoking
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
and they don't work in hazardous work
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
conditions so it's hard to say exactly
 
02:06:09.229 --> 02:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
where this is coming from so if it was a
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
amazing okay thank you thank you
 
02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
I also sign up to testify is um Whitney
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
Hammond from the Department of Health
 
02:06:31.149 --> 02:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
Services hello chair McDonald and
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee members thank you for taking
 
02:06:38.109 --> 02:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
time to let me testify my name is
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
Whitney Hammond and I'm an administrator
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
in the Bureau of prevention and wellness
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
and that's in the division of Public
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
Health Services and that's where the
 
02:06:47.790 --> 02:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
State Health Improvement plan work is
 
02:06:49.549 --> 02:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
housed within the Department as well as
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
the cancer program so this bill really
 
02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
touches two different programs in the
 
02:06:56.910 --> 02:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
department um I've provided written
 
02:06:59.470 --> 02:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
testimony via email so you'll have that
 
02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
as well uh but I did want to just give a
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of context to the State
 
02:07:06.549 --> 02:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement plan for folks and
 
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
then um talk a little bit about
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
pediatric cancer and I can even respond
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
to some of the questions about what we
 
02:07:15.629 --> 02:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
have in terms of data for Pediatric
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
cancer um so a little bit of background
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
the State Health Improvement plan was um
 
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
something that was passed through
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
legislation I think back in
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
2019 and so RSA 126a 88 established it
 
02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
and administratively attached the State
 
02:07:36.990 --> 02:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement Council to the
 
02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:07:40.950 --> 02:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
and what that means is that the
 
02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
department is responsible for um
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
supporting that Council in their work
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
around both doing a state health
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
assessment and then using that
 
02:07:51.549 --> 02:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
assessment to help inform the State
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
plan 2019 is when we began the process
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
of our state health assessment and as
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
you all can imagine we kind of collided
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic in 2020 a lot of the
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
purpose behind the State Health
 
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
assessment is to engage community
 
02:08:10.109 --> 02:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
members to get input and Direction
 
02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
around what our priorities should be and
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of people weren't
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
able to engage with us in the ways they
 
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
would have especially people who are
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
immunal compromised like cancer patients
 
02:08:24.270 --> 02:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
so um we did our best to try and engage
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
people using online surveys but it you
 
02:08:28.589 --> 02:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
know wasn't necessarily the approach we
 
02:08:30.549 --> 02:08:30.559 align:start position:0%
would have taken in a non-pandemic we
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
would have had people come and speak to
 
02:08:35.470 --> 02:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
the council and provide
 
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
testimony um as a result of our state
 
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
health assessment we did finalize a
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
state health Improvement plan and that
 
02:08:43.950 --> 02:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
was released in June of
 
02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639 align:start position:0%
2023 um it's available on a website New
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire livwell.com
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
um the framework for that plan is really
 
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
about reducing Health disparities in
 
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
populations that experience poor health
 
02:08:59.870 --> 02:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
outcomes and so pediatric cancer is
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
really an excellent fit for that State
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement plan um I think we
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
heard excellent testimony about the sort
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
of differences between the experience of
 
02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
cancer as a child and as an adult and I
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
can just tell you numbers wise in New
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have around a 100 cases of
 
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
childhood cancers per year compared to
 
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
you know something in the closer range
 
02:09:26.669 --> 02:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
of 20,000 adult cancers and
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that does lead to sort of
 
02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
disproportionate focus on adults with
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
cancer and so this bill really I think
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
does a great job of focusing on a SM a
 
02:09:39.069 --> 02:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
population that has a small number but
 
02:09:40.830 --> 02:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
has some really
 
02:09:43.069 --> 02:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
significant I would say even trauma
 
02:09:45.390 --> 02:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
related to the experience of having
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
cancer and I think you heard you know
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
Wonderful test testimony about that
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
experience um I did want to just share
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
we do have data the the the Department
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services does
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
collect data on every cancer diagnosed
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
among residents in New Hampshire and
 
02:10:04.030 --> 02:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
that includes children um so that's
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
where I have the information about that
 
02:10:08.109 --> 02:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
we have around a hundred cases diagnosed
 
02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
per year and I can speak to the trend in
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which has been stable over
 
02:10:16.109 --> 02:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
time uh so that's available both on our
 
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
well that I believe is everything do do
 
02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
people have any questions representative
 
02:10:27.239 --> 02:10:28.870 align:start position:0%
people have any questions representative
Bill

02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:10:31.229 --> 02:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um this I'm gonna
 
02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
ask you In fairness I probably should
 
02:10:40.830 --> 02:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
not have asked um Mrs mendz this
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
question so I'll ask it to you since uh
 
02:10:46.830 --> 02:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
this is uh within your realm uh what are
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
we doing to find the source of pediatric
 
02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
cancer yeah so that's an excellent
 
02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
question so federally there are lots of
 
02:10:58.189 --> 02:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
you know agencies that are focused on
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the causes of
 
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
different cancers including childhood
 
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
cancers that tends to be something that
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
comes through the national uh Cancer
 
02:11:08.589 --> 02:11:08.599 align:start position:0%
Institute or NCI so they put out a lot
 
02:11:11.470 --> 02:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
of funding that goes to researchers who
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
are usually in academic Comprehensive
 
02:11:16.109 --> 02:11:16.119 align:start position:0%
Cancer Centers Dartmouth would be an
 
02:11:18.990 --> 02:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
example of a an entity that probably
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
works in that field at the health
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
department we don't tend to get much
 
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
funding in terms of trying to understand
 
02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
the causes of cancer we we really work
 
02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:29.510 align:start position:0%
the causes of cancer we we really work
more

02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
on known causes of cancer and prevention
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
so you know a lot of our work we promote
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
mamography and early screening or
 
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
tobacco cessation um we don't tend to be
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
in the the the space of understanding
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
causes however I do think that the the
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
this bill as it's written could
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely include development of um a
 
02:11:54.549 --> 02:11:54.559 align:start position:0%
focus in that area for New Hampshire and
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
sort of advocating at a national level
 
02:11:58.950 --> 02:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
as part of the development of that
 
02:12:00.669 --> 02:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
component in the State Health
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan and then the final
 
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
piece I would share is that the
 
02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
department did get an appropriation of
 
02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
$500,000 I think last budget for work in
 
02:12:15.629 --> 02:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
childhood cancers and we did facilitate
 
02:12:18.109 --> 02:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
a National Conference talking about
 
02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
about what is known about the causes of
 
02:12:23.310 --> 02:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
childhood cancers with a specific focus
 
02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:24.189 align:start position:0%
childhood cancers with a specific focus
on

02:12:24.189 --> 02:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:12:26.030 --> 02:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
environmental um
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
causes thank you representative Shapiro
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
and then representative
 
02:12:33.790 --> 02:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
Weber yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking this question um I
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
just was perusing the rsas that
 
02:12:40.199 --> 02:12:42.350 align:start position:0%
just was perusing the rsas that
involve

02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
involve
 
02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
um the State Health Improvement plan and
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
the State Health assessment and State
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement plan advisory Council
 
02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
and I
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
um maybe I'm not looking in the right
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
place but I didn't see any specific
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
diagnoses listed or um priority
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
diagnosis so in that way if we were to
 
02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
pass this bill would be an outlier that
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
it would be the only priority listed and
 
02:13:12.549 --> 02:13:12.559 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if I actually looked at
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
the state plan which you just um told us
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
how to find um would we see in there
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
what were the priorities and um what
 
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
were the different categories of illness
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
um that the plan is
 
02:13:29.709 --> 02:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
accentuating so great question um it
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
would be the first specific disease
 
02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's mentioned in that RSA it's
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
written more broadly about the you know
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
conducting a state health assessment and
 
02:13:44.030 --> 02:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
then using that data to guide the State
 
02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement plan and I think the
 
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
Assumption you know with that is that we
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
would drive our decision-making using
 
02:13:53.189 --> 02:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
the State Health assessment data and so
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
for example pediatric cancer might
 
02:13:58.350 --> 02:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
emerge as a priority in that process I
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
think what's different here and I was
 
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
sitting reflecting during the the the
 
02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
last build testimony of you know
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
listening to all of the discussion
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
around opioids a lot of times in our
 
02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
state planning processes we tend to
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
prioritize those issues that are sort of
 
02:14:16.109 --> 02:14:16.119 align:start position:0%
at the Forefront whether it's in the
 
02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
news or it has you know large numbers
 
02:14:20.589 --> 02:14:20.599 align:start position:0%
around it and so sometimes things like
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
pediatric cancer don't rise to the the
 
02:14:25.950 --> 02:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
the top of the list so I think the
 
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
effort you know around this bill was to
 
02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
really make sure that pediatric cancer
 
02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
does get attention in that state health
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan even if it is a small
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
number of you know people in New
 
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are impacted by
 
02:14:41.950 --> 02:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
it follow
 
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
up maybe you've already answered this
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
but um given that this would be the only
 
02:14:49.950 --> 02:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
priority illness listed in statute do
 
02:14:51.629 --> 02:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
you have an opinion about whether we
 
02:14:55.030 --> 02:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
should do that and whether this will
 
02:14:58.109 --> 02:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
lead to you know one by
 
02:15:00.549 --> 02:15:00.559 align:start position:0%
one people coming forward and saying
 
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
well I think this should be included in
 
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
statute so is this is it useful to you
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
as someone who's really working with
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
this whole
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
system yeah it's an excellent question
 
02:15:15.149 --> 02:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
so I was thinking about that myself in
 
02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
preparation for coming today and
 
02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
thinking that you know in a lot of ways
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
I'm appreciative of this bill for doing
 
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
just that because it is giving an
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for um individuals and
 
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
policy makers to kind of weigh in and
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
shape the State Health Improvement plan
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
in a way that you know I think if if it
 
02:15:37.470 --> 02:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
if it isn't done in this Avenue they
 
02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
could just not even you know impact the
 
02:15:42.270 --> 02:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
State Health Improvement plan that
 
02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
council is uh a 40ers council and the
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
representatives on the council were um
 
02:15:51.310 --> 02:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
named in the legislation and they are in
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
the legislation it does say that they
 
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
are able to invite people to come in and
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
present as needed to help inform their
 
02:15:59.790 --> 02:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking but again I think this is
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
an interesting different approach to
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
guiding their work um that I would
 
02:16:07.149 --> 02:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
actually I would be interested to see
 
02:16:09.790 --> 02:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
other priorities be identified you know
 
02:16:11.589 --> 02:16:11.599 align:start position:0%
by through this kind of an Avenue for
 
02:16:14.189 --> 02:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
the State Health Improvement plan
 
02:16:14.199 --> 02:16:15.669 align:start position:0%
the State Health Improvement plan
representative

02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:16:18.910 --> 02:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
Weber so as as a follow up from that and
 
02:16:22.510 --> 02:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
and based on what you just said um I
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
guess my real question is how does the
 
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
state plan get revised and is there a
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
way now that you have been alerted to
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
this issue to get it into the plan short
 
02:16:39.549 --> 02:16:39.559 align:start position:0%
of us actually passing this legislation
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
because although I think talking about
 
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation and this really
 
02:16:49.309 --> 02:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
important problem is Major and important
 
02:16:53.230 --> 02:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
I can also see the 47 bills that will be
 
02:16:57.709 --> 02:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
filed next year when somebody notices
 
02:17:00.349 --> 02:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
that by coming to the legislature as
 
02:17:02.669 --> 02:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
opposed to coming to the
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
council that um their issue suddenly
 
02:17:10.309 --> 02:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
comes to the Forefront and um we have
 
02:17:12.629 --> 02:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
seen that in this committee many many
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
times in many venues and please don't
 
02:17:17.709 --> 02:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
even get me started on Therapeutics
 
02:17:17.719 --> 02:17:19.349 align:start position:0%
even get me started on Therapeutics
cannabis

02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:17:23.070 --> 02:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications but is there a mechanism
 
02:17:26.910 --> 02:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
at the committee level commission level
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
for the commission members to seek out
 
02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:32.270 align:start position:0%
for the commission members to seek out
more

02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
testimony like this and to ensure that
 
02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
issues like this then do
 
02:17:43.309 --> 02:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
get incorporated into the plan
 
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
because one separate bill for each
 
02:17:50.190 --> 02:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
separate condition is a way that lies
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
Madness yeah um excellent question so
 
02:17:54.910 --> 02:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I'll answer the first part in
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
terms of just so June 2023 is when we
 
02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
released our uh final version of the
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
State Health Improvement plan and as I
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
had said that framework is pretty broad
 
02:18:07.950 --> 02:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
around reducing Health disparities for
 
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
populations that experience you know
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
worse outcomes um part of the reason
 
02:18:15.070 --> 02:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
that we had such a broad framework was
 
02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
to enable us to be kind of dynamic
 
02:18:19.950 --> 02:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the next 5 years so it's a
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
5-year State Health Improvement plan and
 
02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
the intention is that it will be
 
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
Revisited and revised throughout that
 
02:18:29.309 --> 02:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
five-year period um and that's actually
 
02:18:31.389 --> 02:18:31.399 align:start position:0%
what the council is doing right now is
 
02:18:33.870 --> 02:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
having a series of presentations from
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts to kind of review
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
and refine pieces of the State Health
 
02:18:42.509 --> 02:18:42.519 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan so I would say yes um
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
we are set up to be able to make this
 
02:18:47.070 --> 02:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a you know addition to the state
 
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
health impr Improvement plan as a
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
council without you know needing a
 
02:18:55.469 --> 02:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
legislation to be passed um I can't
 
02:18:58.230 --> 02:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
speak to I it was my understanding that
 
02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
um there was interest in having this in
 
02:19:04.750 --> 02:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
statute to ensure that pediatric cancer
 
02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
was in fact added by the council and
 
02:19:09.669 --> 02:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
that I can't guar you know I cannot
 
02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
guarantee that the council would make
 
02:19:14.349 --> 02:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
that determination you know in and of
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
themselves representative Palmer and
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
then representative t
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if a member of the
 
02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
council were to say ask for Testimony
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
about pediatric cancer I'm assuming that
 
02:19:32.190 --> 02:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
would be something that could be put on
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
the agenda yes that could be added to
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
the agenda so as a member of the council
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
I'd be perfectly happy to do that okay
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:19:45.549 --> 02:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
TZ uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
02:19:50.670 --> 02:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
M Hammond can you tell
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
us so so I'm interpreting the desire for
 
02:19:57.389 --> 02:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
this bill to help increase awareness of
 
02:19:59.550 --> 02:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
the importance of this particular
 
02:20:02.190 --> 02:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
condition at this point in time and so
 
02:20:04.030 --> 02:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering can you please explain to
 
02:20:06.429 --> 02:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
us are there other places such as wisdom
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
or whatever it's called now uh where we
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
can see the incidence of pediatric
 
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
cancer and then that's one part and then
 
02:20:16.030 --> 02:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
the second part
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
is off times our state plans are more
 
02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
meant to be aspirational and
 
02:20:24.510 --> 02:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
Northstar documents as opposed to
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
actually determining what gets done in
 
02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
the day-to-day work and can you help us
 
02:20:31.550 --> 02:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
understand the link
 
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
between how your Bureau can actually do
 
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
the work whether or not it is written in
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
any plan you know whether it's this time
 
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
or the next three years or in
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
between great so let me I didn't bring
 
02:20:47.309 --> 02:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
my pen up to jot down all those points
 
02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
points but I hopefully we'll get them so
 
02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
um for those who are not familiar with
 
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
it New Hampshire wisdom is the former
 
02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
name of the Departments uh data
 
02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
dashboard so it's a public facing
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
dashboard with a number of different
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
data points including cancer um so it is
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
now yeah the New Hampshire data portal
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
if you Google it it will show up and
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
there's an entire cancer dashboard on
 
02:21:12.270 --> 02:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
there where you can see the most current
 
02:21:14.670 --> 02:21:14.680 align:start position:0%
data we have related to cancer and
 
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
cancer rates and cancer mortality in New
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
hampsh sure there's also um the what do
 
02:21:23.790 --> 02:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
they call it State cancer profile and
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
cancer data visualization tools that are
 
02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
through federal agencies and you can
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
look at New Hampshire specific data
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
there as well that's where I go for my
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
annual percent change data which is what
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
I looked at to look at the trends of
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
pediatric cancer in New Hampshire so yes
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
there's publicly available data on
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
pediatric cancers it's a little harder
 
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
to get it separated out by cancer type
 
02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
among children um that's something we
 
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
could do you know internally as a
 
02:21:53.950 --> 02:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
department we have that data available
 
02:21:55.830 --> 02:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
through our New Hampshire State cancer
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
registry but it's not available on
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
public dashboards because the numbers
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
tend to be so small that they have to be
 
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
suppressed for privacy
 
02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
reasons um so that is information about
 
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
publicly available data in terms of the
 
02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh State plans in New Hampshire tending
 
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
to be aspirational I don't know if you
 
02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
used Northstar but I've heard that used
 
02:22:19.070 --> 02:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
a lot too so it's sort of you know a
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
very general guide of where to head and
 
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
I would say the State Health Improvement
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
plan fits that description and that the
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
goal is in this next step of the State
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement plan to start to
 
02:22:34.510 --> 02:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
flesh out those priority areas and
 
02:22:37.150 --> 02:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
pediatric cancer would be one where we
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
can really get specific about what are
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
we going to do in New Hampshire the
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
other piece to be aware of is there's a
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
lot of really good momentum nationally
 
02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
around childhood C cancer and advocacy
 
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
around getting Childhood Cancer added to
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
State Health Improvement plans and then
 
02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know having them in our state health
 
02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan can help to roll up to
 
02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
inform Federal delegates around
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
policymaking so if it's in New
 
02:23:05.230 --> 02:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's plan that can be very
 
02:23:09.070 --> 02:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:12.270 --> 02:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
anything yeah just uh well so you you
 
02:23:14.190 --> 02:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
did speak to sort of
 
02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh there is a there is there is uh
 
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
there's validity to actually getting
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
something in the ship I had asked
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
concretely in the work you do like does
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
it have to be in the ship for you to be
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
working on it sort of like the linkage
 
02:23:32.190 --> 02:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
how strong that linkage is uh for the
 
02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
cancer program we have some flexibility
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
to be honest we don't get a lot of
 
02:23:39.710 --> 02:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
funding that's flexible as I'd said
 
02:23:42.910 --> 02:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
before we're we're almost 100% federally
 
02:23:45.070 --> 02:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
funded and we tend to be focused on
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
adult Cancers and um sort of
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
evidence-based prevention strategies so
 
02:23:53.150 --> 02:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
we run a free mamography program we you
 
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
know partner on a free coloral screening
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
program but we don't have a lot of
 
02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
flexible funding to put towards um the
 
02:24:03.950 --> 02:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
priorities or you know the strategies
 
02:24:05.630 --> 02:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
that might be identified under the
 
02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
Childhood Cancer priority in the ship
 
02:24:11.269 --> 02:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
02:24:13.269 --> 02:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question I
 
02:24:14.830 --> 02:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
very much enjoyed being on this
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
commission um um it's
 
02:24:19.469 --> 02:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
very educational and but one of the
 
02:24:21.389 --> 02:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
concerns that was just brought was where
 
02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
does the rubber meet the road and that's
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
a huge question um with that said one of
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
my big goals and dreams in life is that
 
02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
we have between being on this commission
 
02:24:33.269 --> 02:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
and this setting I've been able to learn
 
02:24:34.910 --> 02:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
about all the wonderful resources that
 
02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
we have in this state for all sorts of
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
things including cancer a relatively
 
02:24:42.670 --> 02:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
inexpensive way to to do that is to use
 
02:24:44.830 --> 02:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
what you're doing or this program as
 
02:24:46.750 --> 02:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
actually informational so that people
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
can can access these Services they don't
 
02:24:51.230 --> 02:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
know exist is that part of the theme or
 
02:24:53.469 --> 02:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
what you guys want to accomplish as well
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you did a really nice job
 
02:24:57.469 --> 02:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
of describing the approach in New
 
02:24:58.510 --> 02:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the state health
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan and the fact that we
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have a lot of flexible
 
02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
you know General funds or other funds
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
available um and so a lot of the intent
 
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
behind that uh council is about and
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
again I said it's a 40 person Council
 
02:25:13.630 --> 02:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
and then we're talking about right now
 
02:25:15.550 --> 02:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
how do we get each of those council
 
02:25:17.630 --> 02:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
members to become champion around the
 
02:25:19.269 --> 02:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
ship and go out into their local
 
02:25:21.469 --> 02:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
communities and really talk about what
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
the priorities are and promote work in
 
02:25:25.790 --> 02:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
those areas and to your point I mean
 
02:25:28.030 --> 02:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
there are an enormous amount of
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
resources actually available and I think
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know in earlier testimony you hear
 
02:25:35.469 --> 02:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
about sometimes it's very challenging to
 
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
actually find those resources or even
 
02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
like connect them to be able to leverage
 
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
and so I think a lot of the benefit of
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
having Childhood cancer in the ship can
 
02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
be about that alignment and conect
 
02:25:49.309 --> 02:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
connecting already existing
 
02:25:51.550 --> 02:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
resources representative
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
TZ thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:25:55.590 --> 02:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question so as a followup can
 
02:25:58.990 --> 02:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
you speak to the distinction um or
 
02:26:01.230 --> 02:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
explain how this is a state health
 
02:26:03.309 --> 02:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan and not a
 
02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
dphs health Improvement
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
plan yeah so um I was not involved in
 
02:26:12.349 --> 02:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
the legislation that established the
 
02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
State Health Improvement plan but it's
 
02:26:16.349 --> 02:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
my understanding that it was done with a
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of intentionality on making
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
certain that this was not the division's
 
02:26:23.230 --> 02:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
or the Department's Health Improvement
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
plan and that's why it the council was
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
established and the membership was so
 
02:26:31.469 --> 02:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
clearly articulated in the um
 
02:26:33.750 --> 02:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
legislation to include a very broad
 
02:26:36.510 --> 02:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
membership of 40 people everybody from
 
02:26:40.349 --> 02:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
transportation to healthc care housing
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
um and then like I had said uh initially
 
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
we the department was only identified as
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
being admin administratively attached to
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
the council so that we could be helpful
 
02:26:52.590 --> 02:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
in facilitating the council meetings and
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
being able to bring speakers to the
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
council as you know is requested and we
 
02:26:59.910 --> 02:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
do that through a contract with the
 
02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire that ends in
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
June of this year um so it is very
 
02:27:07.630 --> 02:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
different than our previous State Health
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan the one that was done
 
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
before this was the division's um
 
02:27:15.469 --> 02:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan and it was very much
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
Guided by what our federal funding asked
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
us to do and again this is a lot more
 
02:27:21.389 --> 02:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
about what do we need here in New
 
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and how do we kind of
 
02:27:25.710 --> 02:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
Patchwork together all those resources
 
02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:29.230 align:start position:0%
Patchwork together all those resources
and

02:27:29.230 --> 02:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
partners okay I think we've covered it
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
pretty well representative plaz last
 
02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so first uh I
 
02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
wonder if you can send us email help us
 
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
to find uh those portals that you talked
 
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
about about and maybe if you could like
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
share with us more detailed cancer type
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
for children data it would be
 
02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
appreciated but do you agree with
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
statement that New Hampshire has the
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
highest rate of pediatric uh cancer in
 
02:28:04.110 --> 02:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
the union um so yes I'll be I'd be happy
 
02:28:06.349 --> 02:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
to send follow-up links to those
 
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
different data sources I mentioned and I
 
02:28:11.790 --> 02:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
would say New England has the highest
 
02:28:14.429 --> 02:28:14.439 align:start position:0%
rate of pediatric cancer um in the
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
country we actually um partnered with
 
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and had them do a reanalysis
 
02:28:23.309 --> 02:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
of pediatric cancer data the finding
 
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire had the highest rate
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
of pediatric cancer came from a CDC
 
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
study Centers for Disease Control and
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
prevention um and they did not control
 
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
for race and ethnicity and we know that
 
02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
rates of cancer are actually highest
 
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
among um white non-hispanic populations
 
02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
which tend to be higher in the New
 
02:28:44.429 --> 02:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
England states and so when we did a
 
02:28:46.269 --> 02:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
reanalysis and controlled for race and
 
02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
ethnic eity we did find that New England
 
02:28:50.190 --> 02:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
had higher rates overall but that New
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was not different
 
02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
significantly from our neighboring New
 
02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:55.990 align:start position:0%
significantly from our neighboring New
England

02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
England
 
02:28:58.510 --> 02:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
states thank you very much we appreciate
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
your testimony today thank you so much
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
no one else has signed up to speak on
 
02:29:05.269 --> 02:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
this bill so I am going to close this
 
02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
public hearing uh that is all we have
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
until 1 o'clock as far as far as as far
 
02:29:12.990 --> 02:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
as public hearings are concerned we do
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
have an executive session um which we're
 
02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
about a half an hour late on but I'm
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
going to open the executive session at
 
02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:21.910 align:start position:0%
going to open the executive session at
this

02:29:21.910 --> 02:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
time and um I don't know if we need a
 
02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
break before we actually convene or is
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
everyone ready to go
 
02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:31.630 align:start position:0%
everyone ready to go
or

02:29:31.630 --> 02:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
sure you need just Just for information
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
um am I right in in thinking that we
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
only have one bill to exec at this point
 
02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
because we had three that were noticed
 
02:29:44.190 --> 02:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
and we have more work to do on two of
 
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
them exactly um it is my thought that we
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
would put uh House Bill 1303 and House
 
02:30:03.550 --> 02:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:30.510 --> 02:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.990 --> 02:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
okay will we convene uh as a an
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
executive committee or an executive
 
02:32:38.510 --> 02:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
session rather at this time um again
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
given the amount of testimony on House
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 1303 FN and House Bill
 
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
1318 we are going to delay Act action on
 
02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
those until uh February 14th they are
 
02:32:52.349 --> 02:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
early bills so we do need to um be
 
02:32:54.590 --> 02:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
cognizant a cognizant of the February
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
15th deadline uh the only Bill therefore
 
02:32:59.190 --> 02:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
that we would be considering an
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
executive session this morning well
 
02:33:03.870 --> 02:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
actually this afternoon is a house bill
 
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
1068 relative to establishing a blood
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
lead level testing requirement for
 
02:33:11.469 --> 02:33:11.479 align:start position:0%
children entering daycare in public
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
schools do I have a motion
 
02:33:15.269 --> 02:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
representative King did you want to make
 
02:33:16.990 --> 02:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
02:33:19.309 --> 02:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion to
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
itl is there a
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
second representative Le on seconds
 
02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
representative King yes
 
02:33:32.269 --> 02:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
um as as good as this
 
02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
bill or the as good as the intentions
 
02:33:36.469 --> 02:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
are of this
 
02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill there's there's a missing component
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
which is how do we actually again back
 
02:33:46.910 --> 02:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
to what representative Merchant said you
 
02:33:49.070 --> 02:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
know how do we stop the bathtub from
 
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
filling up and how do we turn that water
 
02:33:56.110 --> 02:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
off uh this bill came up last year was
 
02:33:58.590 --> 02:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
passed through the house and made it to
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
the governor and it was it was vetoed at
 
02:34:06.990 --> 02:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
that point and um I spoke I actually
 
02:34:10.469 --> 02:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
spoke at the Senate hearing and I
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned then that we really need to um
 
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
liberate some funds to help homeowners
 
02:34:20.429 --> 02:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
with bled
 
02:34:24.630 --> 02:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
abatement um I'm sympathetic to this I
 
02:34:27.630 --> 02:34:27.640 align:start position:0%
used to be a landlord and I baited all
 
02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:28.590 align:start position:0%
used to be a landlord and I baited all
my

02:34:28.590 --> 02:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
houses but there are landlords out there
 
02:34:35.830 --> 02:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
that need funds there are homeowners out
 
02:34:39.469 --> 02:34:39.479 align:start position:0%
there that need funds to alleviate this
 
02:34:41.950 --> 02:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
problem more testing isn't going to
 
02:34:45.309 --> 02:34:45.319 align:start position:0%
solve the problem um a checkbox isn't
 
02:34:47.630 --> 02:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
going to solve this problem and so
 
02:34:50.070 --> 02:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
therefore I would I would recommend we
 
02:34:53.670 --> 02:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
itl this bill until next year when we
 
02:34:55.830 --> 02:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
could actually put a bill together where
 
02:34:58.670 --> 02:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
there's funding available that's thank
 
02:35:00.830 --> 02:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Weber and then
 
02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:03.630 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Weber and then
representative

02:35:03.630 --> 02:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
Shapiro uh thank you Mr chairman I
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
actually agree with absolutely
 
02:35:11.070 --> 02:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
everything that my colleague has said
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
but I also think that this bill is a
 
02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
separate and important first step we
 
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
passed it once it is the position of the
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
house I think we should pass it again uh
 
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
we have no control as a house over what
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
happens in other places which I won't
 
02:35:34.110 --> 02:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
mention but I think for me this bill is
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
good policy it is a good first step and
 
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
then we need to take all the steps that
 
02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
were also mentioned next year so I will
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
be voting against itl thank you
 
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative chapiro yes thank you Mr
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um I would just like to respond
 
02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
to a few of the points um made in favor
 
02:35:56.630 --> 02:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
of itl
 
02:35:59.269 --> 02:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
um one is that I would be glad to work
 
02:36:00.670 --> 02:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
on an amendment that added an
 
02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation for lead abatement to this
 
02:36:07.269 --> 02:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
bill if that's the if that's the problem
 
02:36:10.910 --> 02:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I think that would um be a difficult
 
02:36:13.349 --> 02:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
sell on a non-budget year but I think
 
02:36:17.950 --> 02:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea um I I
 
02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
would first of all I would disagree with
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
the idea of testing is not going to help
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
anything because I think it's pretty
 
02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
clear that when the more testing the
 
02:36:31.469 --> 02:36:31.479 align:start position:0%
more times that um children are
 
02:36:34.349 --> 02:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with lead poisoning and it's
 
02:36:36.830 --> 02:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
not something that nothing can be done
 
02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
about I mean it can be um there are
 
02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
medical there are medical procedures
 
02:36:45.710 --> 02:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
that will help a child if we don't know
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
that that they are poisoned with lead
 
02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
and then we find out they are so I think
 
02:36:54.389 --> 02:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
that um testing is really important um
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know if only to if only captures a
 
02:36:59.070 --> 02:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
few more people in the state um those
 
02:37:02.910 --> 02:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
are kids who will not end up with
 
02:37:07.230 --> 02:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
um other seli down the road um which we
 
02:37:10.830 --> 02:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
know can be really problematic um and I
 
02:37:14.269 --> 02:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
would also like to say that
 
02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
um and I'm remembering so I could be
 
02:37:21.030 --> 02:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
remembering not quite um correctly but
 
02:37:24.790 --> 02:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
what I remembered of the governor's veto
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
message was that this would keep
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
children out of school that if they came
 
02:37:34.269 --> 02:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
in if they came into a daycare or they
 
02:37:36.750 --> 02:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
came into a school and um they were
 
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
asked about um lead testing and they
 
02:37:42.349 --> 02:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
hadn't had it that this would somehow
 
02:37:45.870 --> 02:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
interfere with um children attending
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
school and I think when this bill was in
 
02:37:51.389 --> 02:37:51.399 align:start position:0%
our committee we took a lot of care to
 
02:37:53.150 --> 02:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that that was not the case at
 
02:37:56.670 --> 02:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
all um and I just kind of I wasn't here
 
02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about this before
 
02:37:59.670 --> 02:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
but I just briefly read it and it says
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
clearly that the
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the entity um where
 
02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
the child is coming in for daycare or
 
02:38:09.910 --> 02:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
school would be to give people who had
 
02:38:13.830 --> 02:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
not had the testing information um not
 
02:38:16.910 --> 02:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
to Bor them for ad from admission into
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
that program or school so I would um I
 
02:38:24.790 --> 02:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
think it's probably as um the
 
02:38:27.550 --> 02:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
representative said not enough um but I
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
think it's worthy and I think we should
 
02:38:33.230 --> 02:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
pass it so I would vote against itl okay
 
02:38:35.389 --> 02:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think we learned two
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
things today that I think are really
 
02:38:41.750 --> 02:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
really promising um the first is that
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
the department already has these data so
 
02:38:45.870 --> 02:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
they already know how many how many many
 
02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
children are being tested for this and
 
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
they already know how many are are
 
02:38:51.070 --> 02:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
showing that they have unsafe lead
 
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
levels um and to me the even better
 
02:38:55.750 --> 02:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
thing I found out is that some school
 
02:38:57.389 --> 02:38:57.399 align:start position:0%
districts are already voluntarily
 
02:38:59.670 --> 02:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
implementing that that means that this
 
02:39:02.830 --> 02:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
does not need a top down state mandated
 
02:39:04.590 --> 02:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
solution to this when we already have
 
02:39:06.429 --> 02:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
school districts who are empowered to do
 
02:39:08.550 --> 02:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
this if they do want to take on that
 
02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
task you know right now we have a
 
02:39:13.230 --> 02:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
snapshot problem we had not only the
 
02:39:15.429 --> 02:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
pandemic where it was hard to get a
 
02:39:17.110 --> 02:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
point ments with your primary care
 
02:39:19.389 --> 02:39:19.399 align:start position:0%
provider but there was also the recall
 
02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
of these important testing things you
 
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
know we see a big glaring red flashing
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
danger sign right now but those seem to
 
02:39:29.550 --> 02:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
be those are likely artifacts of that
 
02:39:32.590 --> 02:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
recall you know right now we are facing
 
02:39:34.469 --> 02:39:34.479 align:start position:0%
significant issues in child care and
 
02:39:35.790 --> 02:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make sure that we have
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
enough child facing people if we add
 
02:39:40.750 --> 02:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
more administrated burden that just
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
means that more time much more time away
 
02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
from taking care of kids and that might
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
mean that for every facility you might
 
02:39:49.550 --> 02:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
be one less kid maybe there's somewh
 
02:39:51.110 --> 02:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
they can handle it but there's others
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
where this administrative burden is
 
02:39:54.990 --> 02:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
going to lead to the fact that you know
 
02:39:56.349 --> 02:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
either you need to hire somebody and
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
raise prices or most likely you're
 
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
trying to allocate those people who can
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
work at the center and you might be able
 
02:40:04.030 --> 02:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
to see fewer kids then we're pushing an
 
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
unfounded mandate onto our school
 
02:40:07.830 --> 02:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
districts having them add this we were
 
02:40:10.389 --> 02:40:10.399 align:start position:0%
told 15 seconds a kid that's great we
 
02:40:13.389 --> 02:40:13.399 align:start position:0%
have over 3,000 kids in Dairy that's a
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
not an insignificant amount of time
 
02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
that's over two weeks of eight hours a
 
02:40:18.910 --> 02:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
day going through those documents and
 
02:40:21.070 --> 02:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
looking at it you know I I think that
 
02:40:24.349 --> 02:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
this is a solution that's trying to deal
 
02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
with a snapshot in time I think that we
 
02:40:28.429 --> 02:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
already have the data and local
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
districts and childcare are already
 
02:40:32.110 --> 02:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
empowered to do this so I don't I think
 
02:40:34.750 --> 02:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
that this you know is an unnecessary
 
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
overreach representative Murphy thank
 
02:40:40.750 --> 02:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I I I would never argue
 
02:40:42.429 --> 02:40:42.439 align:start position:0%
you know I I'm sympathetic to the fact
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
that if you do have this um uh data
 
02:40:48.110 --> 02:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
reported that it could have consequences
 
02:40:50.710 --> 02:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
regarding landlords Etc like that but if
 
02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
I can step back from that as a separate
 
02:40:53.990 --> 02:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
issue and think about this is only a
 
02:40:56.190 --> 02:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
healthc care issue the more data we have
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
and I would beg to argue that I don't
 
02:40:59.550 --> 02:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
think we have all the data available and
 
02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
If this is truly as representative
 
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
grassy says you're simply adding a check
 
02:41:05.950 --> 02:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
box or making sure that we note that
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
people have been tested for lead for
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
those that come into the state and have
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
not been tested those have not been
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
tested here that are not exempt I I
 
02:41:15.630 --> 02:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
think the more data we have the better
 
02:41:17.389 --> 02:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
the snapshot and the understanding of
 
02:41:21.230 --> 02:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
where the problem is and I'm I'm also
 
02:41:23.550 --> 02:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about the priority you know for
 
02:41:25.990 --> 02:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
Pediatric cancer and how we can identify
 
02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
issues early it's it's it's clear to me
 
02:41:32.110 --> 02:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
that lead poisoning in children has
 
02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
significant consequences there are
 
02:41:35.469 --> 02:41:35.479 align:start position:0%
neurological issues that we all hear
 
02:41:37.670 --> 02:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
about but there are kidney issues liver
 
02:41:40.710 --> 02:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
issues cardiovascular issues in my
 
02:41:42.670 --> 02:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
specialy you know lead and bone will
 
02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
stay there for 20 years so it is not
 
02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
like it's in there and you can get rid
 
02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
of it but also if we do know early on
 
02:41:51.710 --> 02:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
that there is lead in these children
 
02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
there are you know we talked about
 
02:41:55.070 --> 02:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
treatment there are keying agents that
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
people can take to actually help
 
02:41:58.630 --> 02:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
mitigate the consequences of increased
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
lead level so I would never argue you
 
02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
know against the fact that we would have
 
02:42:06.030 --> 02:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
potential consequences and I appreciate
 
02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
that and maybe that's a separate
 
02:42:10.590 --> 02:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
bill but on the other hand I I honestly
 
02:42:12.790 --> 02:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
think that this is a bill that gives us
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
more data and the more data we have the
 
02:42:16.469 --> 02:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
more children that we will be able to
 
02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
identify and treat you know
 
02:42:21.389 --> 02:42:21.399 align:start position:0%
expeditiously so I would vote itl or or
 
02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion okay thank you
 
02:42:26.910 --> 02:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
representative TZ uh thank you I just
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
want to follow on to that that this is
 
02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
not about uh like a population or a data
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
issue surveillance happens after the
 
02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
fact and there's a time delay this is
 
02:42:39.389 --> 02:42:39.399 align:start position:0%
about having an opportunity that we
 
02:42:41.950 --> 02:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to miss to identify and
 
02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
intervene or offer the families the
 
02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to recognize is that they
 
02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
maybe can catch something that they
 
02:42:50.910 --> 02:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
weren't aware of so that the child
 
02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have these potentially very very
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
serious and damaging uh impacts that are
 
02:42:58.150 --> 02:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
lifelong and that really affect
 
02:42:59.550 --> 02:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
everything they affect their ability to
 
02:43:02.429 --> 02:43:02.439 align:start position:0%
be thriving successful adults oftentimes
 
02:43:04.429 --> 02:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
contributing to society so we do have
 
02:43:08.110 --> 02:43:08.120 align:start position:0%
societal impacts and benefit
 
02:43:10.910 --> 02:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
from uh in you know from trying to help
 
02:43:14.030 --> 02:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh the youths be identified
 
02:43:16.469 --> 02:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
early thank you
 
02:43:19.150 --> 02:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative primmer thank you Mr
 
02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um I agree with the healthc
 
02:43:24.670 --> 02:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
care approach on this and and prevention
 
02:43:26.030 --> 02:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
is really important I'm going to speak
 
02:43:29.230 --> 02:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
as a former Schoolboard chairman where
 
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
um our special ed costs are a huge
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
problem and this is one area that the
 
02:43:39.150 --> 02:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
earlier lead is detected the less likely
 
02:43:41.309 --> 02:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
these kids are going to need significant
 
02:43:44.670 --> 02:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
help um in in the district that I was in
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
at the time the school budget would be
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
$2 million and all of a sudden there'd
 
02:43:51.950 --> 02:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
be one kid with an out of placement um
 
02:43:53.469 --> 02:43:53.479 align:start position:0%
out of District placement and that's
 
02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
$100,000 5% of the school budget just
 
02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
poof gone and so I think that aside from
 
02:44:01.870 --> 02:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
the health being the most important
 
02:44:04.590 --> 02:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
thing this is a it's it's also a you
 
02:44:08.349 --> 02:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
know a cost and a and a taxpayer issue
 
02:44:10.670 --> 02:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
where the earlier we find these things
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
the better the health is the less likely
 
02:44:15.389 --> 02:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
we're to incur significant costs that
 
02:44:18.269 --> 02:44:18.279 align:start position:0%
are born by what my
 
02:44:20.670 --> 02:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
constituents love to bug me about which
 
02:44:23.070 --> 02:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
is property taxes thank you
 
02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:24.190 align:start position:0%
is property taxes thank you
representative

02:44:24.190 --> 02:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
kosman thank you Mr chairman um so
 
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
everyone is talking about you know the
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
health issues and impacts of of lead and
 
02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
I think we're losing sight of
 
02:44:38.910 --> 02:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
fundamentally why we're here we all
 
02:44:40.710 --> 02:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
swore an oath to the Constitution to
 
02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
uphold that um and to not infringe or
 
02:44:49.710 --> 02:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
usurp the private rights of our citizens
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
part one is reserved back to the people
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's the Bill of Rights form of
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
government all falls under part two um
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
if you read Worcester versus P Plymouth
 
02:45:01.150 --> 02:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
which was a court case of New Hampshire
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court they affirmed um that
 
02:45:07.550 --> 02:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
government cannot touch those private
 
02:45:10.750 --> 02:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
rights in part one and Troxel versus
 
02:45:13.269 --> 02:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
Granville is a US Supreme Court case
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
that affirms that parenting and um
 
02:45:20.030 --> 02:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
directing the upbringing of one's
 
02:45:23.389 --> 02:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
children is one of the oldest private
 
02:45:25.550 --> 02:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
rights it's one of the oldest Liberty
 
02:45:29.469 --> 02:45:29.479 align:start position:0%
interests so we can't touch this at all
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
and I would argue that this law that
 
02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
requires parents to have children tested
 
02:45:38.269 --> 02:45:38.279 align:start position:0%
for lead is unconstitutional and is null
 
02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
and void on its face and we'd be better
 
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
off with an amendment to repeal it and
 
02:45:45.550 --> 02:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
we'd be upholding our oath of if we did
 
02:45:48.950 --> 02:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
that um to vote in favor of passing this
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
bill or against killing it is a
 
02:45:53.389 --> 02:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
violation of our oath um and it's a very
 
02:45:53.399 --> 02:45:54.630 align:start position:0%
violation of our oath um and it's a very
serious

02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
serious
 
02:45:58.269 --> 02:45:58.279 align:start position:0%
matter because then we are condoning
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
usurpation of private rights a better
 
02:46:03.950 --> 02:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
way to go about handling the lead issue
 
02:46:08.269 --> 02:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
in my opinion is to direct DHHS which is
 
02:46:11.349 --> 02:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
instituted to help uh the citizens of
 
02:46:14.190 --> 02:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
this state to raise awareness and
 
02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
increase education
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
and Outreach um and
 
02:46:22.870 --> 02:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
to perhaps uh suggest legislation that
 
02:46:25.870 --> 02:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
um is directed more at regulating the
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine and enforcing
 
02:46:29.670 --> 02:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
what's required of people who
 
02:46:31.349 --> 02:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
voluntarily contracted with the state
 
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
and agreed to be ruled by the
 
02:46:39.030 --> 02:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
legislature um so we're we're way out in
 
02:46:41.950 --> 02:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
left field of where we should be uh fun
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
fundamentally in our our work here
 
02:46:50.469 --> 02:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
and um we should be focusing more on
 
02:46:54.190 --> 02:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
Outreach that's representative uh Weber
 
02:46:57.150 --> 02:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you I just want to say
 
02:47:03.550 --> 02:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
that I have worked with all of you for a
 
02:47:07.750 --> 02:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
long time and I know that each one of us
 
02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
here takes that oath incredibly
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
seriously clear we don't interpret the
 
02:47:20.750 --> 02:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
constitution in the same way but what we
 
02:47:23.309 --> 02:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
have before us is
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
exactly what was just suggested it is
 
02:47:30.070 --> 02:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
Outreach it is information and it is
 
02:47:34.990 --> 02:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
informing parents who may then make a
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
decision about what they want to do
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill requires a parent
 
02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
to do anything so I think it's
 
02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:49.389 align:start position:0%
to do anything so I think it's
exactly

02:47:49.389 --> 02:47:49.399 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
02:47:52.110 --> 02:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
what my colleague was talking about in
 
02:47:53.230 --> 02:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
02:47:56.710 --> 02:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
information but um and I will not go
 
02:47:59.670 --> 02:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
into the Constitutional analysis of the
 
02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
underlying bill because it's not before
 
02:48:04.030 --> 02:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
us today and that would certainly be a
 
02:48:05.710 --> 02:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
non-gain Amendment which would need a
 
02:48:07.030 --> 02:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
whole other
 
02:48:10.670 --> 02:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr
 
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
chair bill is well intended but I think
 
02:48:19.469 --> 02:48:19.479 align:start position:0%
a couple of things the intent I believe
 
02:48:22.429 --> 02:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
the bill was to collect data to find out
 
02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
how successful we are with RSA 130
 
02:48:31.269 --> 02:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
A5 a b and c we do have testing and so
 
02:48:33.469 --> 02:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
forth but we don't have any data to help
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
us understand how successful we've been
 
02:48:38.150 --> 02:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
doing as far as collecting and getting
 
02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
levels done so I think I totally support
 
02:48:43.150 --> 02:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
collecting the data but I think there's
 
02:48:46.309 --> 02:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
a flaw in the bill fundamentally that I
 
02:48:48.910 --> 02:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
see and if you go back and look at it
 
02:48:51.349 --> 02:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
this is what I want to get clarification
 
02:48:55.750 --> 02:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
on if you go back and look at line
 
02:48:58.469 --> 02:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
seven and line
 
02:49:01.429 --> 02:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
eight the form shall include at least
 
02:49:04.750 --> 02:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
one result of a blood level test
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
required under the
 
02:49:11.309 --> 02:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
RSA what happens if that hasn't been
 
02:49:14.190 --> 02:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
done if it's not done can the child
 
02:49:18.590 --> 02:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
still go to school so I would ask for
 
02:49:20.429 --> 02:49:20.439 align:start position:0%
possibly amending it somehow or taking
 
02:49:23.309 --> 02:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
the time to amend it saying that we want
 
02:49:25.630 --> 02:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
to have the test done if it hasn't been
 
02:49:28.229 --> 02:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
done it doesn't mean the child can't go
 
02:49:31.229 --> 02:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
into school because the form doesn't
 
02:49:34.590 --> 02:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
have blood level test on it so I think
 
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a flaw in the way the bill
 
02:49:38.910 --> 02:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
was drafted and I think it needs to be
 
02:49:41.269 --> 02:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
corrected before we move forward so
 
02:49:43.670 --> 02:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
therefore I'd be open to amending the
 
02:49:45.670 --> 02:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
bill to get language in the bill to
 
02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:48.349 align:start position:0%
bill to get language in the bill to
clarify

02:49:48.349 --> 02:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:53.630 --> 02:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:56.910 --> 02:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
up representative Canon yeah go ahead
 
02:49:59.910 --> 02:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
I'll come back to him having been a
 
02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
facilitator of of um five Head Start
 
02:50:06.070 --> 02:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
locations uh and knowing that the Head
 
02:50:09.630 --> 02:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
Start program requires some sort of
 
02:50:12.950 --> 02:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh um check the box that there the child
 
02:50:14.269 --> 02:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
that's coming into the Head Start
 
02:50:16.990 --> 02:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
program has been tested for lead um
 
02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's one of their requirements um but
 
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's Head Start also caters to lowincome
 
02:50:26.550 --> 02:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
families so that's that's something that
 
02:50:30.670 --> 02:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
we need to consider is to H can we help
 
02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
those families by um providing some
 
02:50:34.950 --> 02:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
method of getting Leed testing so they
 
02:50:38.150 --> 02:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
can get their children into the program
 
02:50:41.389 --> 02:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
um would be important otherwise that
 
02:50:43.309 --> 02:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
that program which is helping families
 
02:50:45.870 --> 02:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
and kids um won't be able to service
 
02:50:48.349 --> 02:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
those those children and the other
 
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
challenge is that we ran into at least
 
02:50:53.269 --> 02:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
in one facility is when a child comes
 
02:50:55.670 --> 02:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
into the program and does test positive
 
02:50:58.229 --> 02:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
for lead poisoning is it shuts down a
 
02:50:59.870 --> 02:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
building for a while so they can
 
02:51:01.790 --> 02:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
determine whether the lead came from
 
02:51:06.070 --> 02:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
that building or not um so it's uh just
 
02:51:08.670 --> 02:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
just to flag it it's an issue not just
 
02:51:11.349 --> 02:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
for the the family that's has a child
 
02:51:15.190 --> 02:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
that needs some help um with with lead
 
02:51:17.070 --> 02:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
poisoning potentially but also could
 
02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
affect other families who are trying to
 
02:51:21.229 --> 02:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
get their children educated at the same
 
02:51:26.269 --> 02:51:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
Weber I've read the bill again it says
 
02:51:32.070 --> 02:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
that the forms shall include at least
 
02:51:34.229 --> 02:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
one result of blood level testing if
 
02:51:36.590 --> 02:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's happened if it doesn't hasn't
 
02:51:39.389 --> 02:51:39.399 align:start position:0%
happened all the school is going to do
 
02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
is give the parent information there's
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
nothing here that says that the child
 
02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
will be excluded excluded from the
 
02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
school or anything else so
 
02:51:52.990 --> 02:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
um without wanting to beat what seems to
 
02:51:55.910 --> 02:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
me a dead horse more than we have to we
 
02:51:59.469 --> 02:51:59.479 align:start position:0%
already passed it once it it came out
 
02:52:01.550 --> 02:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
with a positive recommendation for this
 
02:52:05.830 --> 02:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
committee once and um there was an
 
02:52:07.670 --> 02:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
amendment at that time that I think took
 
02:52:09.750 --> 02:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
care of most of what we were talking
 
02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
about um and so I see no harm in passing
 
02:52:17.229 --> 02:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:20.710 --> 02:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
other discussion representative kosman
 
02:52:23.910 --> 02:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have a a
 
02:52:27.870 --> 02:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
question it may be rhetorical um but can
 
02:52:31.349 --> 02:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
anyone in this room point to where in
 
02:52:33.070 --> 02:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
the second part of the Constitution of
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are granted the
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
authority to play Nanny and interfere
 
02:52:41.670 --> 02:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
with the private rights of raising
 
02:52:45.870 --> 02:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
children by our citizens
 
02:52:47.550 --> 02:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think anyone can point to that
 
02:52:49.389 --> 02:52:49.399 align:start position:0%
Grant and if it's not granted we don't
 
02:52:50.389 --> 02:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
have that
 
02:52:53.150 --> 02:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
Authority we can't take anyone's private
 
02:52:55.630 --> 02:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
rights without a trial by
 
02:52:58.389 --> 02:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
jury that's that's what our constitution
 
02:52:58.399 --> 02:53:00.710 align:start position:0%
jury that's that's what our constitution
says

02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
additionally this is a very slippery
 
02:53:04.790 --> 02:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
slope lead poisoning is not a
 
02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:06.349 align:start position:0%
slope lead poisoning is not a
communicable

02:53:06.349 --> 02:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
communicable
 
02:53:09.550 --> 02:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
disease um yes it's very concerning
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
health issue but the best way to get
 
02:53:14.429 --> 02:53:14.439 align:start position:0%
people to do things that are good for
 
02:53:15.790 --> 02:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
for them is to show them why it's good
 
02:53:15.800 --> 02:53:16.670 align:start position:0%
for them is to show them why it's good
for

02:53:16.670 --> 02:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
them um next will the schools be you
 
02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
know requiring that they have testing
 
02:53:26.990 --> 02:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
for HIV before kids come to school will
 
02:53:30.510 --> 02:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
we direct the schools to uh maintain
 
02:53:33.670 --> 02:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
arsenic levels of children's blood
 
02:53:36.190 --> 02:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
because arsenic in Wells is a very
 
02:53:39.870 --> 02:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
common issue in New Hampshire as well um
 
02:53:41.429 --> 02:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
cancer screenings you know there's a
 
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
whole Litany of things are returning
 
02:53:46.349 --> 02:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
schools into two Healthcare facilities
 
02:53:47.670 --> 02:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
because that's not appropriate and we
 
02:53:48.750 --> 02:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
don't have that Grant in the
 
02:53:50.950 --> 02:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution thank you representative
 
02:53:54.750 --> 02:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
Seth King thank you Mr chair um I have a
 
02:53:56.670 --> 02:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
different reason why I'm opposed to this
 
02:53:59.790 --> 02:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
bill um so I have a lot of different
 
02:54:01.790 --> 02:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
ideas for legislation that I would like
 
02:54:05.150 --> 02:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
to see you know enacted but I I didn't
 
02:54:07.710 --> 02:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
file a lot of ideas because quite
 
02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
frankly I know they have no chance of
 
02:54:11.110 --> 02:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
passing at least under this current
 
02:54:13.229 --> 02:54:13.239 align:start position:0%
current makeup we have in the house so I
 
02:54:14.830 --> 02:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
don't feel like wasting anybody's time
 
02:54:16.590 --> 02:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't know with all the respect to
 
02:54:18.670 --> 02:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors and sponsor of this
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislation I just feel like unless they
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
have new information that the governor
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
has changed his mind or that we've got a
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
lot more votes in the house and the
 
02:54:27.630 --> 02:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
Senate to override The veto it just
 
02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
feels like a waste of time to me we've
 
02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
got over a thousand bills that we're
 
02:54:33.950 --> 02:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with this year and we're we're
 
02:54:35.790 --> 02:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
going to be rehashing a bill that is
 
02:54:37.870 --> 02:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
already it's already said and done maybe
 
02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
next year bring it up when there's a new
 
02:54:41.429 --> 02:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
house a new Senate and a new governor
 
02:54:42.990 --> 02:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
and something will have but nothing has
 
02:54:44.269 --> 02:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
changed so I don't see why we're
 
02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
spending all this time when there's I
 
02:54:48.349 --> 02:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
mean look I understand it's an important
 
02:54:50.030 --> 02:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
issue but I've got important issues too
 
02:54:52.590 --> 02:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
that I just chose not to not to file a
 
02:54:54.030 --> 02:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
bill on because I knew there was no
 
02:54:55.710 --> 02:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
chance it was going to pass and this has
 
02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
no chance it's going to pass let's just
 
02:54:59.630 --> 02:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
move on that's that's my attitude
 
02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:03.469 align:start position:0%
move on that's that's my attitude
representative

02:55:03.469 --> 02:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:06.910 --> 02:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
Merchant I would ask the ranking member
 
02:55:09.710 --> 02:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
to call for a caucus so I can understand
 
02:55:11.429 --> 02:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
this because I really look at the bill
 
02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
the way it's written right now if
 
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's no blood let level test done the
 
02:55:18.190 --> 02:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
way I read it it doesn't say if it's
 
02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
been done it has to be recorded it says
 
02:55:21.349 --> 02:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
it shall be
 
02:55:23.630 --> 02:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
done and that's my concern is that when
 
02:55:25.110 --> 02:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
you start looking at this language I'm
 
02:55:26.469 --> 02:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
just concerned about where it's going to
 
02:55:28.229 --> 02:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
go and unintended consequences what we
 
02:55:31.429 --> 02:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
passing thank you it it it
 
02:55:38.670 --> 02:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:41.469 --> 02:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
result I'm glad to have a caucus if you
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:51.229 --> 02:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
or we could just take a vote and
 
02:55:52.429 --> 02:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
everybody could vote the way they want
 
02:55:54.910 --> 02:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
to vote on the bill
 
02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
right but would you like a
 
02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:01.870 align:start position:0%
right but would you like a
caucus

02:56:01.870 --> 02:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:03.630 --> 02:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
Sor I
 
02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:07.910 align:start position:0%
Sor I
think

02:56:07.910 --> 02:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:10.830 --> 02:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
I if if you want a caucus to go and
 
02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
discuss it we can do that or if you
 
02:56:14.469 --> 02:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
would like to just vote the way want to
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:22.349 --> 02:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
prefer I would I would like to talk to
 
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
the caucus about am I misunderstanding
 
02:56:27.070 --> 02:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
this because the way I'm reading it for
 
02:56:30.550 --> 02:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
btim I see it as being un unattended
 
02:56:32.269 --> 02:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
consequence and a flaw in it and if I
 
02:56:33.990 --> 02:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
can be convinced otherwise I'd be voting
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
for it could we have five minutes sure
 
02:56:39.190 --> 02:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and we'll just walk across the
 
02:56:42.309 --> 02:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
hall Mr chair can I ask for Republican
 
02:56:44.389 --> 02:56:44.399 align:start position:0%

02:56:53.389 --> 02:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
not okay I mean well we're gonna be

03:04:58.469 --> 03:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
1593 I guess yeah how does that work
 
03:05:00.030 --> 03:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
with everyone gives us a little more
 
03:05:01.309 --> 03:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
time I know
 
03:05:03.349 --> 03:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
so I think with a couple people
 
03:05:04.750 --> 03:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
testifying elsewhere I think that's a
 
03:05:04.760 --> 03:05:12.269 align:start position:0%
testifying elsewhere I think that's a
great

03:05:12.269 --> 03:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:12.279 --> 03:53:22.349 align:start position:0%
 
idea

03:53:22.349 --> 03:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:24.990 --> 03:53:25.000 align:start position:0%

1593 um establishes a developmental
 
03:54:00.070 --> 03:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
Services Community integration Fund in
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
the department of the health and human

services to support individuals with
 
03:54:05.920 --> 03:54:07.469 align:start position:0%
services to support individuals with
development

03:54:07.469 --> 03:54:07.479 align:start position:0%
development
 
03:54:10.710 --> 03:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh uh this is a disability
 
03:54:14.309 --> 03:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
Community uh requested Bill specifically
 
03:54:16.189 --> 03:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
it is needed because people with
 
03:54:18.510 --> 03:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities have been ex
 
03:54:20.790 --> 03:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
historically excluded from certain
 
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
social interactions employment
 
03:54:24.670 --> 03:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities and educational
 
03:54:26.910 --> 03:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
environments Community integration
 
03:54:30.269 --> 03:54:30.279 align:start position:0%
including Recreation is a way to ensure
 
03:54:32.229 --> 03:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
that all people have access to a full
 
03:54:34.469 --> 03:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
spectrum of social educational and
 
03:54:34.479 --> 03:54:35.630 align:start position:0%
spectrum of social educational and
professional

03:54:35.630 --> 03:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
professional
 
03:54:37.670 --> 03:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities these opportunities are
 
03:54:40.229 --> 03:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
embedded within the existing Community
 
03:54:42.950 --> 03:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
rather than segregated uh this not only
 
03:54:44.269 --> 03:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
promotes the well-being of the
 
03:54:46.389 --> 03:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
individual but also increases the
 
03:54:48.830 --> 03:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
overall health of the entire
 
03:54:51.710 --> 03:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
Community uh as written this bill uh
 
03:54:53.910 --> 03:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
provides for services that are currently
 
03:54:56.910 --> 03:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
outside of the existing developmental
 
03:54:56.920 --> 03:54:58.030 align:start position:0%
outside of the existing developmental
disability

03:54:58.030 --> 03:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
disability
 
03:55:01.790 --> 03:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
waivers uh so uh regarding uh so
 
03:55:04.870 --> 03:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
therefore um would need the need for the
 
03:55:08.349 --> 03:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
separate fund uh to provide uh access to
 
03:55:11.790 --> 03:55:11.800 align:start position:0%
these service Services uh does include a
 
03:55:13.710 --> 03:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh an appropriation from the general
 
03:55:16.750 --> 03:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
fund uh as written I think that you know
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
the key issues are are uh for this
 
03:55:23.349 --> 03:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
committee to address uh include uh the
 
03:55:24.990 --> 03:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
definition of the activities that are
 
03:55:26.910 --> 03:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
included and whether Community
 
03:55:31.070 --> 03:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
integration uh is is complete uh enough
 
03:55:35.110 --> 03:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
for for uh implementation by uh
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
HHS um rather than discuss uh how
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
important these Services can be and how
 
03:55:43.710 --> 03:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
much uh reduction in other services may
 
03:55:46.349 --> 03:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
come from access to this uh I'm going to
 
03:55:49.349 --> 03:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
leave it to those members uh many of
 
03:55:53.990 --> 03:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
whom will testify uh to you uh today uh
 
03:55:55.990 --> 03:55:56.000 align:start position:0%

03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill it is a bipartisan bill I thank you

is Melissa nth I'm an attorney with the
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:56:46.750 --> 03:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
um and the department supports the
 
03:56:50.429 --> 03:56:50.439 align:start position:0%
concept of of this bill um for the
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
services that is looking to provide but
 
03:56:56.189 --> 03:56:56.199 align:start position:0%
um does have would like to work with the
 
03:56:59.910 --> 03:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor um to provide some additional
 
03:57:03.790 --> 03:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
language for some areas um we you know
 
03:57:05.429 --> 03:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity that this
 
03:57:05.439 --> 03:57:06.910 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity that this
legislation

03:57:06.910 --> 03:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:57:09.710 --> 03:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
provides what uh I will highlight just a
 
03:57:11.389 --> 03:57:11.399 align:start position:0%
couple of the concerns and areas that
 
03:57:13.349 --> 03:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
the department would like to work on um
 
03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
for example in this legislation there is
 
03:57:18.189 --> 03:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
reference to community integration
 
03:57:21.670 --> 03:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
Services however this could be confusing
 
03:57:24.309 --> 03:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
because there are Community integration
 
03:57:26.590 --> 03:57:26.600 align:start position:0%
Services is a category of services
 
03:57:29.550 --> 03:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
provided for on a couple of the Home and
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services waivers um so
 
03:57:33.389 --> 03:57:33.399 align:start position:0%
in working with the sponsor the
 
03:57:35.469 --> 03:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
department would hope to perhaps uh
 
03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
retitle the the name of these services
 
03:57:39.229 --> 03:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
so that there is no conf Fusion for
 
03:57:41.229 --> 03:57:41.239 align:start position:0%
services that are covered under a
 
03:57:44.670 --> 03:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid waiver and those that are
 
03:57:47.349 --> 03:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
not the the department because this
 
03:57:50.510 --> 03:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be something uh additional and the
 
03:57:52.149 --> 03:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
way that this would be funded would be
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
outside of the way that funding requests
 
03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
are handled currently because it is not
 
03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
through a waiver um the department would
 
03:58:03.070 --> 03:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
need a position to be able to administer
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
this fund um and so that is something
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
we'd like to work on the department did
 
03:58:09.790 --> 03:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
provide a f note worksheet uh but it's
 
03:58:11.070 --> 03:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
our understanding in working with the
 
03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
LBA that they have had uh a lot of
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note worksheets that they are
 
03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
working on and some have not yet caught
 
03:58:20.229 --> 03:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
up to the bills but you will see uh the
 
03:58:22.469 --> 03:58:22.479 align:start position:0%
Department's request in that regard
 
03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
reflected in the fiscal note
 
03:58:27.229 --> 03:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
worksheet Additionally the department
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
appreciates that this bill includes rul
 
03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
making Authority uh however the
 
03:58:34.990 --> 03:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
department would hope to work with the
 
03:58:38.149 --> 03:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
sponsors to or the the sponsors in order
 
03:58:40.670 --> 03:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
to have more clarity in this bill about
 
03:58:43.550 --> 03:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
what the legislative intent is um the
 
03:58:45.269 --> 03:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
department does not want to get to the
 
03:58:48.550 --> 03:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
rulle making stage and uh you work with
 
03:58:50.670 --> 03:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
those in the advocacy community and
 
03:58:52.830 --> 03:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
other interested parties um and have
 
03:58:55.469 --> 03:58:55.479 align:start position:0%
there be perhaps some misunderstandings
 
03:58:58.030 --> 03:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
about what the legislative intent was
 
03:58:59.870 --> 03:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
for example the types of services that
 
03:59:03.670 --> 03:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
should be included um it how requests
 
03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
are prioritized questions of that nature
 
03:59:09.070 --> 03:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
so the department would like to see some
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
additional language put in to the bill
 
03:59:13.790 --> 03:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
itself so that it can help expedite
 
03:59:16.910 --> 03:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
rulle making when that stage comes um
 
03:59:19.469 --> 03:59:19.479 align:start position:0%
and so and given these open questions
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
the department can't take a bill a
 
03:59:23.510 --> 03:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
position on the bill as it's written um
 
03:59:25.870 --> 03:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
but Wants To Be A continuing resource to
 
03:59:27.630 --> 03:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
this committee to the bill sponsors and
 
03:59:30.429 --> 03:59:30.439 align:start position:0%
others involved um in working on it and
 
03:59:32.830 --> 03:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to take any
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:52.229 align:start position:0%
 
Nel

03:59:52.229 --> 03:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:55.469 --> 03:59:55.479 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how that dollar figure
 
03:59:56.990 --> 03:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
was reached in putting in this
 
03:59:58.910 --> 03:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
legislation um I I'm not sure if the
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor might be someone that could be a
 
04:00:02.389 --> 04:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
better resource for that and my
 
04:00:03.790 --> 04:00:03.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is that where the money
 
04:00:07.349 --> 04:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
will come from uh is in this legislation
 
04:00:11.550 --> 04:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation so that it would be new
 
04:00:15.950 --> 04:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
new general fund dollars that are not
 
04:00:18.910 --> 04:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:26.429 --> 04:00:26.439 align:start position:0%
discussion any other questions seeing
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%

me to speak today I'm usually not used
 
04:00:52.790 --> 04:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
to going so early in the uh in the
 
04:00:55.070 --> 04:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
testimony uh my name is Will Walker I
 
04:00:57.309 --> 04:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
live in Hollis uh with my son and my
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
wife my son is 24 years old has autism
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
um but here today I'm representing both
 
04:01:06.229 --> 04:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
myself as well as a group of people that
 
04:01:08.670 --> 04:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
I lead uh in the gateways Community Serv
 
04:01:12.469 --> 04:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
area I have a group of about 275 people
 
04:01:14.429 --> 04:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
that represent families participants and
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
other people that are interested in our
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
space uh in my I'm sorry I'm asking you
 
04:01:21.990 --> 04:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
to support HB 1593 please uh I first
 
04:01:25.510 --> 04:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to start today uh why are we here
 
04:01:29.189 --> 04:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
our law our New Hampshire law RSA 171a
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
calls calls for this and I quote I have
 
04:01:33.229 --> 04:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
to read it directly individual and
 
04:01:35.070 --> 04:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
Family Services based upon full
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
participation in the community sharing
 
04:01:38.790 --> 04:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
ordinary places
 
04:01:40.950 --> 04:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
developing meaningful relationships and
 
04:01:43.110 --> 04:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
learning things that are useful as well
 
04:01:45.429 --> 04:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
as enhancing the social and economic
 
04:01:48.189 --> 04:01:48.199 align:start position:0%
status of persons served all right so we
 
04:01:49.990 --> 04:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
can call this
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
inclusion and what we can call not
 
04:01:54.550 --> 04:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
inclusion inclusion is not clustering
 
04:01:56.830 --> 04:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities into one home
 
04:01:59.710 --> 04:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
classroom workspace or social Center
 
04:02:01.710 --> 04:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
okay so we're here because the recent
 
04:02:03.950 --> 04:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rulings have determined that
 
04:02:05.550 --> 04:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
certain items and services that have
 
04:02:07.389 --> 04:02:07.399 align:start position:0%
been historically funded by Medicaid in
 
04:02:09.990 --> 04:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are no longer uh supposed
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
to be covered and will not be covered in
 
04:02:14.550 --> 04:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
the future okay so we have families that
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
were depending upon funding for these
 
04:02:17.630 --> 04:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
services for inclusion into the
 
04:02:20.510 --> 04:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
community that have been now um uh have
 
04:02:22.110 --> 04:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
that money taken away all right so so
 
04:02:24.229 --> 04:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
their family members are not uh being
 
04:02:26.990 --> 04:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
included in the community um and so in
 
04:02:29.389 --> 04:02:29.399 align:start position:0%
general this this is a gap between what
 
04:02:32.950 --> 04:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid provides and what RSA 178 calls
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
for okay so um what I I want to talk
 
04:02:38.830 --> 04:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
about the impact of this so this impact
 
04:02:40.469 --> 04:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
impacts the individuals themselves it
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
hurts them both in their mental health
 
04:02:44.349 --> 04:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
because they are now isolated some of
 
04:02:46.149 --> 04:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
these activities are physical activities
 
04:02:47.950 --> 04:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
so it can impact the the person's
 
04:02:49.710 --> 04:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
physical well-being because it's no
 
04:02:52.429 --> 04:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
longer exercise that they may get but
 
04:02:54.269 --> 04:02:54.279 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I see here is that
 
04:02:57.630 --> 04:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
you know without inclusion we segregate
 
04:02:59.830 --> 04:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay and with the segregation whe
 
04:03:01.110 --> 04:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
whether we do it on purpose or not we
 
04:03:02.750 --> 04:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
are segregating people by not including
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
them in society and once we start
 
04:03:06.229 --> 04:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
segregating people we see all the
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
negative impact of SE of segregation not
 
04:03:10.389 --> 04:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
only on the individual but on society
 
04:03:12.870 --> 04:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
itself and so let's talk about the
 
04:03:14.990 --> 04:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
growth of our society right if if we
 
04:03:16.750 --> 04:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
don't include people with disabilities
 
04:03:20.670 --> 04:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
in our society we segregate them and we
 
04:03:22.510 --> 04:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
start treating them differently and we
 
04:03:25.750 --> 04:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
don't appreciate diversity and with
 
04:03:27.710 --> 04:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
inclusion we start appreciating
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
diversity we we appreciate that people
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
are different we help people build
 
04:03:33.670 --> 04:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
friendships lasting
 
04:03:36.030 --> 04:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
relationships okay we grow the community
 
04:03:38.269 --> 04:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
where we support each other we provide a
 
04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
network of support to help each other
 
04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay with segregation you don't have
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
that network of support these people
 
04:03:45.590 --> 04:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
don't exist you don't realize that they
 
04:03:48.070 --> 04:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
they they are just like you and me uh
 
04:03:49.750 --> 04:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
they just have different abilities okay
 
04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
so by um by uh supporting inclusion you
 
04:03:55.309 --> 04:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
don't just support the person themselves
 
04:03:57.950 --> 04:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
you actually help Society grow okay so
 
04:04:00.790 --> 04:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to please support HB 1593
 
04:04:02.269 --> 04:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
to help fill the gap between what
 
04:04:06.469 --> 04:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid supports and what law RSA 17A
 
04:04:08.670 --> 04:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
requires thank you thank you
 
04:04:08.680 --> 04:04:35.389 align:start position:0%
requires thank you thank you
representative

04:04:35.389 --> 04:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.229 --> 04:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
not sure representative not and we're
 
04:04:39.389 --> 04:04:39.399 align:start position:0%
having a little trouble hearing you if
 
04:04:54.670 --> 04:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:57.309 --> 04:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
closer yeah
 
04:04:59.469 --> 04:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
so and I'll give you because some of
 
04:05:01.349 --> 04:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
this is is is interesting right because
 
04:05:03.269 --> 04:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
you may see this is just recreational
 
04:05:08.349 --> 04:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
fun activity okay and um in some cases
 
04:05:10.149 --> 04:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's the only way the person can get out
 
04:05:11.990 --> 04:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
of their house it's the only way for
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
them to leave these might include things
 
04:05:16.030 --> 04:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
like karate okay it might include
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
bowling okay and just Lane rental and
 
04:05:22.149 --> 04:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
shoe rental okay so things like that but
 
04:05:23.910 --> 04:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
and so to the to the lay person that
 
04:05:25.870 --> 04:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand the space and doesn't
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
understand what it means to be isolated
 
04:05:29.590 --> 04:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
in your home these things seem like oh
 
04:05:31.309 --> 04:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
just a night out you know just some fun
 
04:05:32.950 --> 04:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
activity but these are really really
 
04:05:32.960 --> 04:05:36.110 align:start position:0%
activity but these are really really
important

04:05:36.110 --> 04:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:06.429 --> 04:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know okay I I don't I don't know
 
04:06:10.830 --> 04:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
the answer okay um I my understanding is
 
04:06:13.510 --> 04:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
the million dollars is the ask but uh I
 
04:06:15.429 --> 04:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
think less than that might be
 
04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate but I don't know okay I I'm
 
04:06:20.189 --> 04:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
GNA let somebody else uh speak to those
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:26.429 --> 04:06:26.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
04:06:27.510 --> 04:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for the
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%

04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
speak directly in mic into the
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%

name is Lisa Bodwin I am a resident of
 
04:07:17.149 --> 04:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
conquered a parent of an adult on the
 
04:07:19.189 --> 04:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
developmental disability waiver and a
 
04:07:21.750 --> 04:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
Disability Policy professional I
 
04:07:23.950 --> 04:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate this opportunity to share my
 
04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
perspective on why Community integration
 
04:07:30.149 --> 04:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
funds are important and consistent with
 
04:07:31.870 --> 04:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
the granite State's long history of
 
04:07:33.550 --> 04:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
supporting people with disabilities to
 
04:07:36.149 --> 04:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
live alongside people without
 
04:07:38.149 --> 04:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities as you know know New
 
04:07:40.309 --> 04:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the first state in the
 
04:07:43.590 --> 04:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
nation to close our institution Laconia
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
State School the passage of RSA 171a
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
which this bill is seeking to augment
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
was one of America's earliest state
 
04:07:57.269 --> 04:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
level legislative efforts to create a
 
04:07:59.630 --> 04:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
community-based system of supports and
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
services for people with disabilities it
 
04:08:06.790 --> 04:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
is how we got uh people out of Laconia
 
04:08:08.149 --> 04:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
it is the found
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
which which made closing lonia State
 
04:08:13.030 --> 04:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
School possible RSA
 
04:08:16.030 --> 04:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
171a as you've heard
 
04:08:20.550 --> 04:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
CMS um uh is has sent New Hampshire this
 
04:08:22.590 --> 04:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
this directive no longer to use funds
 
04:08:27.510 --> 04:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
this way um CMS is acting in congruently
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
by denying the direct costs of
 
04:08:31.710 --> 04:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
community- based activities given that
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
CMS has strict housing standards which
 
04:08:38.429 --> 04:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
deny CMS funds to pay for congregate
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
housing settings the driving force
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
behind the Medicaid waivers is to
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
provide alternatives to congregate or
 
04:08:47.590 --> 04:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
segregated settings toward the goal of
 
04:08:49.830 --> 04:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities having lives
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
that look like their peers not yet
 
04:08:54.750 --> 04:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
impacted by life with a
 
04:08:57.469 --> 04:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
disability they want people on the DD
 
04:08:59.229 --> 04:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
waiver to be housed in the middle of
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
their communities that yet then have
 
04:09:07.229 --> 04:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
said to us um uh CMS funds can only pay
 
04:09:10.349 --> 04:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic art classes where only
 
04:09:13.469 --> 04:09:13.479 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities are doing art
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
or therapeutic music or therapeutic
 
04:09:19.030 --> 04:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
horseback riding or therapeutic gyms
 
04:09:21.870 --> 04:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
this is a segregated setting and it
 
04:09:25.469 --> 04:09:25.479 align:start position:0%
defies the underlying logic of
 
04:09:28.750 --> 04:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
cms's vision and goals for life with a
 
04:09:31.830 --> 04:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
disability uh New Hampshire's RSA 171a
 
04:09:34.830 --> 04:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
colon 13 was very cleverly
 
04:09:37.590 --> 04:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
written to contain words like have
 
04:09:40.870 --> 04:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
abilitation which is about habil like
 
04:09:44.189 --> 04:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
life social interactions not
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and social treatments not
 
04:09:50.429 --> 04:09:50.439 align:start position:0%
simply Rehabilitation or medical
 
04:09:52.469 --> 04:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
services and I have that quote in my
 
04:09:54.670 --> 04:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
testimony which you will see I won't I
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
won't read that quote from the tech from
 
04:10:01.630 --> 04:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
the from the from the law let me add the
 
04:10:04.349 --> 04:10:04.359 align:start position:0%
intersection of disability and poverty
 
04:10:08.189 --> 04:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
poverty is too rarely discussed
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
due to the severity of the workforce
 
04:10:12.830 --> 04:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
shortage and housing crisis adults on
 
04:10:15.750 --> 04:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
the DD waiver overwhelmingly live with
 
04:10:18.269 --> 04:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
their parents which is technically not
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of these parents on
 
04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
their careers families with children
 
04:10:24.670 --> 04:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
with disabilities fall into poverty at
 
04:10:26.950 --> 04:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
the highest rates of any identified
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
population due to caring for their
 
04:10:30.910 --> 04:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
children mothers reduce the number of
 
04:10:33.070 --> 04:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
hours they work or quit altogether to
 
04:10:34.670 --> 04:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
stay at home and provide care for their
 
04:10:36.910 --> 04:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities adults with
 
04:10:39.870 --> 04:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities make up approximately 12%
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
of the United States working age
 
04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
population however people with
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities account for more than half
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:50.800 --> 04:10:52.990 align:start position:0%
 
poverty

04:10:52.990 --> 04:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
poverty
 
04:10:55.550 --> 04:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
and I have two other bullet points on
 
04:10:57.630 --> 04:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
poverty and disability but the data is
 
04:11:00.109 --> 04:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
clear you'll see it in my testimony New
 
04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire obtains a great deal of free
 
04:11:05.950 --> 04:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
care for adults with disabilities their
 
04:11:07.870 --> 04:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
family members literally pay the price
 
04:11:09.710 --> 04:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
and find themselves often times
 
04:11:12.349 --> 04:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
financially more insecure during
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
retirement when compared to families not
 
04:11:18.149 --> 04:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
yet impacted by disability the data
 
04:11:22.269 --> 04:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't lie it makes sense to ensure
 
04:11:24.710 --> 04:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
that the loved ones of parents who are
 
04:11:28.670 --> 04:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
continuing to care for their adults with
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities can take an art or music
 
04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
class alongside their neighbors without
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities if people with disabilities
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
are to have robust community-based lives
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
wherein they have Equitable access to
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
activities alongside citizens who do not
 
04:11:48.550 --> 04:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
experience disabilities we have to
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
provide funds for these social
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
interactions and relationship building
 
04:11:54.910 --> 04:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
to do otherwise is to tell people with
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities you can only have friends
 
04:11:58.910 --> 04:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
with people who have disabilities please
 
04:12:01.630 --> 04:12:01.640 align:start position:0%
stop wrapping up please start wrapping
 
04:12:03.109 --> 04:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
up your tesy yes people with
 
04:12:05.309 --> 04:12:05.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities may not be in the prison of

Institutions but they remain inal
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%

04:12:12.510 --> 04:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
unlocking the door and it will make New

for my membership at the

YMCA this year it did not pay for the
 
04:14:44.670 --> 04:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
YMCA because of the federal

waiver fuz can only pay for therapeutic

thank you very
 
04:19:54.389 --> 04:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
04:19:57.510 --> 04:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
Weber you Mr chairman because I'm
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
noticing that u i I used to be a
 
04:20:04.149 --> 04:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
playground teacher so I can project but
 
04:20:06.950 --> 04:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh I'm here having trouble hearing the
 
04:20:08.710 --> 04:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm seeing people nodding
 
04:20:10.510 --> 04:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
their heads so it's not just me losing
 
04:20:13.389 --> 04:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
my hearing um I know that the
 
04:20:15.630 --> 04:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
microphones in this room are are more
 
04:20:15.640 --> 04:20:16.790 align:start position:0%
microphones in this room are are more
geared

04:20:16.790 --> 04:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
geared
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
to transmitting our voices to the public
 
04:20:24.269 --> 04:20:24.279 align:start position:0%
but I don't normally they also amplify a
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
bit and I'm wondering if there's a
 
04:20:28.389 --> 04:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
technical issue I can go and check next
 
04:20:33.469 --> 04:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
door and see if she she's okay
 
04:20:36.830 --> 04:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
yeah again she had meent Christina had
 
04:20:38.269 --> 04:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that you do need to
 
04:20:39.910 --> 04:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
speak directly into the microphone but
 
04:20:41.910 --> 04:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
that being said they're usually more
 
04:20:43.990 --> 04:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
sensitive than than they seem to be
 
04:20:45.870 --> 04:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
right now so by the way everybody can
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
hear me I hope okay probably don't want
 
04:20:50.309 --> 04:20:50.319 align:start position:0%

out into the community and not be
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%

the adult system and they're not quite

Crossroads I actually live in Northern
 
04:23:07.750 --> 04:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
Human Services area
 
04:23:11.550 --> 04:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
um our situation is um is going to be
 
04:23:13.990 --> 04:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
very similar U my loved one is going to
 
04:23:18.750 --> 04:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
graduate on time at 18 however we're
 
04:23:21.269 --> 04:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
looking at what's going to happen and
 
04:23:23.590 --> 04:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
where is socialization going to happen
 
04:23:27.309 --> 04:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
in the community once he turns
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
18 we're not 100% sure um and these
 
04:23:34.429 --> 04:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
activities where he can be out in the
 
04:23:58.149 --> 04:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:02.950 --> 04:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
um oh there it is great thank you um so
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that um that was made
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
clear in April was that um CMS the
 
04:24:11.309 --> 04:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
centers for uh Medicare and Medicaid
 
04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
were no longer going to um to fund these
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
non-therapeutic Community um activities
 
04:24:21.630 --> 04:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
however the um New Hampshire um in New
 
04:24:23.670 --> 04:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they did say that they would
 
04:24:26.590 --> 04:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
fund someone to go with someone to these
 
04:24:28.670 --> 04:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
activities and that they would fund you
 
04:24:31.830 --> 04:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
know Transportation which is wonderful
 
04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
however if you can go to these things
 
04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
but you can't get in ins side then
 
04:24:40.990 --> 04:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
you're just a person looking through the
 
04:24:43.710 --> 04:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
window and that's not something that we
 
04:24:45.710 --> 04:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
want to to have happen here in New
 
04:24:48.510 --> 04:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh just a little bit um a
 
04:24:51.950 --> 04:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more um you know uh my loved
 
04:24:55.389 --> 04:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
one is currently um with inhome support
 
04:24:57.429 --> 04:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
um this bill may or may not have an
 
04:24:59.149 --> 04:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
effect on that but I'm looking I'm
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
looking down the road to 18 um and you
 
04:25:06.429 --> 04:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
know for us in our situation personally
 
04:25:07.870 --> 04:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
our circumstances have changed
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
dramatically with the passing of my
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
husband so things that were things that
 
04:25:16.990 --> 04:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
we could pay for now we cannot and you
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
know we're not looking
 
04:25:22.189 --> 04:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
for a a a huge amount of money we're
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
looking for some things and some
 
04:25:26.510 --> 04:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
activities like you know um the previous
 
04:25:28.830 --> 04:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
speaker was talking about the YMCA where
 
04:25:31.510 --> 04:25:31.520 align:start position:0%

time with your community it's really
 
04:25:36.670 --> 04:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
important for everyone and that's that's
 
04:25:39.469 --> 04:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh I know you were going to say yeah
 
04:25:41.710 --> 04:25:41.720 align:start position:0%

04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
Merchant this may be actually for the
 
04:25:54.630 --> 04:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor but I want to be help me
 
04:25:57.109 --> 04:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
understand we're looking for access to
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
the activity not for modification of the
 
04:26:03.149 --> 04:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
equipment within the activity is that
 
04:26:05.389 --> 04:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
what I'm understanding so we're just
 
04:26:06.990 --> 04:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
trying to be sure the person can get to
 
04:26:10.229 --> 04:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
the YMCA not asking the YMCA to modify
 
04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
what they have within their building to
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
accommodate the disability or I wrong so
 
04:26:18.510 --> 04:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
I know that there there are going to be
 
04:26:20.070 --> 04:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
yes there um there are going to be
 
04:26:21.469 --> 04:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
people who are going to speak after me
 
04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
who can speak uh a little more
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
um uh with a little more knowledge about
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
that but my understanding is it's it's
 
04:26:32.590 --> 04:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
to pay for the Activity thank you and
 
04:26:35.349 --> 04:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
yeah okay other questions representative
 
04:26:37.750 --> 04:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm I'm kind of
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
intrigued by this CMS
 
04:26:45.229 --> 04:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
year um so my son is developmentally
 
04:26:48.070 --> 04:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
disabled um we went to Lakes Region
 
04:26:50.189 --> 04:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
community service to talk about Services
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
there we informed that they can no
 
04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
longer case do case management for him
 
04:26:54.790 --> 04:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
which was probably the most important
 
04:26:57.630 --> 04:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
thing that they were doing for him so it
 
04:26:59.309 --> 04:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
seems to me that what we're talking
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
about is yet another thing on top of
 
04:27:03.510 --> 04:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
another thing on top of another thing
 
04:27:04.790 --> 04:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
and so you're dealing with a lot of
 
04:27:06.990 --> 04:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
stressors not just one one am I am I
 
04:27:09.790 --> 04:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
wrong about that um I can't speak to
 
04:27:13.990 --> 04:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
case management but it's it there are uh
 
04:27:15.630 --> 04:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that have been made
 
04:27:18.109 --> 04:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
clear in the last year from CMS what
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
they will and will not
 
04:27:25.269 --> 04:27:25.279 align:start position:0%

um okay
 
04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh we the families are asking to fund
 
04:28:24.590 --> 04:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
this fiscal note HB 1593 for Community
 
04:28:26.790 --> 04:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
integration Services I believe the
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
funding is so important to keep
 
04:28:31.790 --> 04:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
individuals in the
 
04:28:35.070 --> 04:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
community doing activities to help
 
04:28:40.109 --> 04:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
integrate Collective belonging and also
 
04:28:41.830 --> 04:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
self-confidence let's look at the
 
04:28:45.469 --> 04:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
meaning of community which translates to
 
04:28:49.870 --> 04:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
being in local community town or city to
 
04:28:52.670 --> 04:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
be part of a community is to partake of
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
an activity outside or inside with other
 
04:29:00.309 --> 04:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
members outside the family this is the
 
04:29:02.990 --> 04:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
reason that Laconia state school was
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
closed due to the separation of of a
 
04:29:08.910 --> 04:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
population not included in their
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
Community or
 
04:29:14.189 --> 04:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
schools let's look at the word
 
04:29:18.550 --> 04:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
integrative its dictionary meaning not
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
segregated designated as available to
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
all Races or
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
groups in New Hampshire we have fought
 
04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
for integrated schools in classrooms and
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
now we are fighting to support
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
integrated opportunities in our
 
04:29:34.720 --> 04:29:36.550 align:start position:0%
integrated opportunities in our
communities

04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
being in our community and having the
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity of doing activities with or
 
04:29:46.109 --> 04:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
without certified instruction or
 
04:29:48.750 --> 04:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic for all individuals is
 
04:29:52.229 --> 04:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
essential for an individual's well-being
 
04:29:54.870 --> 04:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
and to keep costs
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable on a personal experience uh
 
04:30:00.429 --> 04:30:00.439 align:start position:0%

pausy uh doing an activity like
 
04:30:10.149 --> 04:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
bowling candle pin
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
bowling uh provides a combination of Co
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
strength balance coordination in
 
04:30:19.070 --> 04:30:19.080 align:start position:0%

others around her at the bowling alley
 
04:30:24.429 --> 04:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
she thrives on getting all those pins

down and she welcomes the Applause on
 
04:30:28.479 --> 04:30:29.790 align:start position:0%
down and she welcomes the Applause on
her

04:30:29.790 --> 04:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
accomplishments this may not seem
 
04:30:34.670 --> 04:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic to many but it challenges
 
04:30:37.710 --> 04:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
her to do a t task outside of
 
04:30:40.950 --> 04:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
traditionally medically based
 
04:30:43.750 --> 04:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
therapies the bonuses being out in her
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
community supporting local businesses
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
and connecting with people outside her
 
04:30:52.630 --> 04:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
family or her medical
 
04:30:55.349 --> 04:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
team does she really need a certified
 
04:30:57.950 --> 04:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
bowling or a med uh teacher or
 
04:31:02.229 --> 04:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
instructor no she is uh at her best
 
04:31:05.229 --> 04:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
doing bowling and why would we want to
 
04:31:08.710 --> 04:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
is ol at them that they have to have a
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
specialization in um in in an activity
 
04:31:15.429 --> 04:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
so we ask the committee to fund this
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and set aside funds in this
 
04:31:21.950 --> 04:31:21.960 align:start position:0%

04:33:43.029 --> 04:33:43.039 align:start position:0%

Community Michaela began receiving what
 
04:34:11.310 --> 04:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
is now being referred to as Community
 
04:34:13.949 --> 04:34:13.959 align:start position:0%
integration Services when she accessed
 
04:34:16.269 --> 04:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
the inhome support
 
04:34:18.869 --> 04:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
waiver um during that time these
 
04:34:21.629 --> 04:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
community activities were instrumental
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
in maintaining her ability to
 
04:34:25.789 --> 04:34:25.799 align:start position:0%
participate in community activities that
 
04:34:27.910 --> 04:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
she would not otherwise be able to

participate in due to the nature of her
 
04:34:32.789 --> 04:34:32.799 align:start position:0%
disabilities initially the activities
 
04:34:36.150 --> 04:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
were reimbursed under the waiver BDS
 
04:34:38.109 --> 04:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
recently alerted families that
 
04:34:39.990 --> 04:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
activities in the community were now
 
04:34:42.390 --> 04:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
being interpreted as recreational and
 
04:34:45.551 --> 04:34:45.561 align:start position:0%
diversional and that CMS would no longer
 
04:34:47.709 --> 04:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
fund the cost of these activities under
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
the waivers it's important to note that
 
04:34:53.709 --> 04:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
um the federal government provides a 50%
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
match to the state funding that's um
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
applied to the to wavered Services BDS
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
indicated that these activities could be
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
funded via the area agency Family
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
Support councils however no additional
 
04:35:11.551 --> 04:35:11.561 align:start position:0%
funds were allocated to the area
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
agencies or the councils by BDS to
 
04:35:17.949 --> 04:35:17.959 align:start position:0%
address this long-term need DHHS the
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
bureau H uh the the um department has
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
indicated that no money was appropriated
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
for this urgent need in the 2024 2025

04:36:08.709 --> 04:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
are little to no day programs available
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
um so I as a parent had to build and
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
develop her Day program which
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
Incorporated Community integration
 
04:36:18.670 --> 04:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
activities into her day however because
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
of this new ruling they are uh not
 
04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
funded under the waivers and so um it if
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
uh they are not funded it's going to
 
04:36:32.109 --> 04:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
result in um not families not being able
 
04:36:34.230 --> 04:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
to partner with the state to continue to
 
04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
do this for Lifetime it's not it's not
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%

name is Margaretta buala from Dunbarton
 
04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
and I have a daughter
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
with I am here in support of hb1 1593
 
04:38:28.150 --> 04:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
which as I understand uh would establish
 
04:38:30.029 --> 04:38:30.039 align:start position:0%
a fund to help individuals with special
 
04:38:32.910 --> 04:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
needs integrate into the community at
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
large recently the Medicaid program
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
which distributes The Adult Services
 
04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
budgets has stopped reimbursing
 
04:38:42.029 --> 04:38:42.039 align:start position:0%
individuals for some recreational
 
04:38:44.910 --> 04:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
activities uh including gym membership
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm probably not saying anything
 
04:38:47.551 --> 04:38:47.561 align:start position:0%
that you don't know
 
04:38:50.269 --> 04:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
already um my daughter has a gym
 
04:38:52.150 --> 04:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
membership which she takes advantage of
 
04:38:54.189 --> 04:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
two to three time two to at least two
 
04:38:57.189 --> 04:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
times a week it is a typical gym where
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
the general public can go she is
 
04:39:01.629 --> 04:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
integrated in the community and is a
 
04:39:04.029 --> 04:39:04.039 align:start position:0%
regular attendee at a regular Zumba
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
class and she loves this
 
04:39:09.150 --> 04:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
immensely she is also part of a unified
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
cheer team which is very important to
 
04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
her last year her Medicaid budget helped
 
04:39:16.949 --> 04:39:16.959 align:start position:0%
to pay for that and this year it did
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
not um interestingly a couple of years
 
04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
ago the medic Medicaid increased the
 
04:39:24.551 --> 04:39:24.561 align:start position:0%
allowable budget for recreational
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
purposes only to eliminate the many of
 
04:39:29.670 --> 04:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
those allowable
 
04:39:31.869 --> 04:39:31.879 align:start position:0%
activities my understanding is that
 
04:39:33.629 --> 04:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
Community involvement is part of the
 
04:39:35.949 --> 04:39:35.959 align:start position:0%
requirement by Medicaid for individuals
 
04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
with developmental
 
04:39:39.708 --> 04:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
disabilities one great way to make this
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
happen is to allow for recreational
 
04:39:44.190 --> 04:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
activities such as me gym
 
04:39:46.270 --> 04:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
memberships many people in the special
 
04:39:48.750 --> 04:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
needs commun Community benefit greatly
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
from physical activity and people in the
 
04:39:54.150 --> 04:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
commun community benefit greatly from
 
04:39:56.670 --> 04:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
getting to know people with special
 
04:40:00.030 --> 04:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
needs as a result of the funding being
 
04:40:02.150 --> 04:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
dropped for these two activities that
 
04:40:04.310 --> 04:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
she does the burden now falls on the
 
04:40:04.320 --> 04:40:05.270 align:start position:0%
she does the burden now falls on the
families

04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
or it doesn't happen at
 
04:40:10.350 --> 04:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
all and that's the end of my testimony I
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
will take questions if you have any okay

04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh I wanted to share with you our
 
04:41:58.230 --> 04:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
personal story with um the challenges
 
04:42:00.590 --> 04:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
with no longer having the funds to pay
 
04:42:03.150 --> 04:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
for the recreational activities Katie is
 
04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
on the inhome support waiver
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
and last year I signed her up to do
 
04:42:11.470 --> 04:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
dance an Adaptive dance class in
 
04:42:15.150 --> 04:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
Rochester and along with that a drama
 
04:42:17.830 --> 04:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
class with her typical developing peers
 
04:42:20.030 --> 04:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
I live in wolfboro you might ask why are
 
04:42:22.150 --> 04:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
you traveling to Rochester well it's a
 
04:42:24.510 --> 04:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
very rural area and there's just not a
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
lot of activities available um so right
 
04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
before the uh big recital I got word
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
from my area agency well we can't can't
 
04:42:38.910 --> 04:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
pay your bill anymore uh for Studio for
 
04:42:41.470 --> 04:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
Katie's dance lessons because that's no
 
04:42:44.190 --> 04:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
longer covered and actually correction
 
04:42:45.990 --> 04:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
they were able to pay for the dance
 
04:42:49.310 --> 04:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
because it was uh signified as adaptive
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
but her drama program they would no
 
04:42:54.990 --> 04:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
longer pay for so being a single mom
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
being a lowincome single mom who works
 
04:42:59.628 --> 04:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
part-time and is the primary carer of my
 
04:43:01.788 --> 04:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
daughter I had to scramble to try to
 
04:43:03.390 --> 04:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
find those funds so Katie could
 
04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
participate in the play
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
because she wasn't going to be allowed
 
04:43:09.030 --> 04:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
to participate if I didn't pay the bill
 
04:43:11.708 --> 04:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
so I had to come up with those means and
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
now this year I didn't sign Katie up for
 
04:43:17.030 --> 04:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
and those classes that she wanted to
 
04:43:19.390 --> 04:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
take the drama class because I'm not
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
able to afford to pay for them and I'm
 
04:43:24.310 --> 04:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
really concerned going forward she's
 
04:43:28.430 --> 04:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
going to be 13 um actually going on 30
 
04:43:30.750 --> 04:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
um in her mind she's getting her first
 
04:43:33.990 --> 04:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
phone she's very excited mom not so much
 
04:43:36.910 --> 04:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
um but I'm trying to think ahead what's
 
04:43:39.708 --> 04:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
going to happen for her uh going forward
 
04:43:41.470 --> 04:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
with Recreation and being in the
 
04:43:45.070 --> 04:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
community she's so outgoing and yes
 
04:43:47.230 --> 04:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
being in an Adaptive program can be
 
04:43:49.270 --> 04:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
helpful for her to have that extra bit
 
04:43:51.750 --> 04:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
of support but she needs to be with her
 
04:43:55.510 --> 04:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
peers and I'm really sad that um we were
 
04:43:58.030 --> 04:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
not able to do that this year and the
 
04:44:00.390 --> 04:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
challenge at her middle school is they
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
don't have enough support staff for
 
04:44:05.430 --> 04:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
Katie to participate in after school
 
04:44:07.750 --> 04:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
programs so that's why she's not
 
04:44:10.110 --> 04:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
involved um I know my time I heard the
 
04:44:12.670 --> 04:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
buzzer and I just wanted to say thank
 
04:44:14.350 --> 04:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
you so much for the opportunity today
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
and I really hope that you will consider
 
04:44:20.590 --> 04:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
uh a yes on 1593 and I'm open to any
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
questions you might have okay right
 
04:44:25.150 --> 04:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
thank you our representative
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just have a
 
04:44:30.708 --> 04:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
question about need-based scholarships
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
to these programs things like that um do
 
04:44:34.910 --> 04:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
they have anything like that that they
 
04:44:37.470 --> 04:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
offer that are separate from CMS funding
 
04:44:39.910 --> 04:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
and things like that so are you meaning
 
04:44:42.510 --> 04:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
from the area agency I'm talking about
 
04:44:44.310 --> 04:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
from the program she was involved
 
04:44:46.990 --> 04:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
directly so the dance studio that she
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
was involved it's it's not a a it's just
 
04:44:51.628 --> 04:44:51.638 align:start position:0%
a private dance studio so they did not
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
have scholarships available thank you
 
04:44:54.120 --> 04:44:54.910 align:start position:0%
have scholarships available thank you
you're

04:44:54.910 --> 04:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:44:57.948 --> 04:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
welcome other
 
04:45:01.628 --> 04:45:01.638 align:start position:0%
questions great no okay I'm saying thank
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
you so much thank you very
 
04:45:03.280 --> 04:45:04.990 align:start position:0%
you so much thank you very
much

04:45:04.990 --> 04:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
was that the last uh uh if you fill out
 
04:45:11.150 --> 04:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
a pink card for us I can yes I can
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
answer uh representative Nagel's
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
question about the million dollars I
 
04:45:15.708 --> 04:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
don't think I don't think that's been
 
04:45:18.430 --> 04:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
addressed uh just real quick Alex kbis
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing the area agencies
 
04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
the million dollars in the bill was just
 
04:45:22.000 --> 04:45:22.910 align:start position:0%
the million dollars in the bill was just
a

04:45:22.910 --> 04:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:45:25.070 --> 04:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
placeholder um because of the deadlines
 
04:45:28.708 --> 04:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
with uh OS since that time the area
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
agencies did a survey five of the 10
 
04:45:35.390 --> 04:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
responded and prior to the new
 
04:45:37.510 --> 04:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation from
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
CMS those five area agencies were
 
04:45:42.830 --> 04:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
spending between $40,000 and $50,000 a
 
04:45:44.230 --> 04:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
year on these services so if you
 
04:45:45.868 --> 04:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
extrapolate that out to the
 
04:45:48.670 --> 04:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
10 probably a half a million dollars
 
04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
would would do it U the other point is
 
04:45:54.628 --> 04:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
uh as HHS had presented we have to we
 
04:45:56.590 --> 04:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
have to write rules for the eligibility
 
04:45:57.788 --> 04:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
to make sure that these funds are
 
04:46:00.030 --> 04:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
responsibly used and that's probably
 
04:46:01.470 --> 04:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
going to take at least six months so if
 
04:46:02.948 --> 04:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
you look at this
 
04:46:05.150 --> 04:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
bium I would be surprised if even a
 
04:46:07.708 --> 04:46:07.718 align:start position:0%
quarter million dollars is expended U by
 
04:46:10.230 --> 04:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
the end of this bium so I I think the
 
04:46:11.788 --> 04:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
appropriation can be probably
 
04:46:14.590 --> 04:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced uh from the
 
04:46:15.990 --> 04:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's currently in the
 
04:46:17.430 --> 04:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
bill but that's obviously something that
 
04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
I assume the finance committee would
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
would look at as this bill will go to
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
finance but that that the million
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
dollars was just a placeholder and as I
 
04:46:27.070 --> 04:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
said if I don't I was not able I made a
 
04:46:29.548 --> 04:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
phone call um to tr and try to get a
 
04:46:31.350 --> 04:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
number of folks I think you would also
 
04:46:33.948 --> 04:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
ask what was the census I did not ask
 
04:46:35.670 --> 04:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
that question I think I can get that
 
04:46:37.230 --> 04:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
information far you but I might need a
 
04:46:39.070 --> 04:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
week or so so I I don't know how many
 
04:46:41.470 --> 04:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
people had recreation in their budgets
 
04:46:46.948 --> 04:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
prior to um the CMS the new CMS uh
 
04:46:50.830 --> 04:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
decree okay did you have a where it was
 
04:46:52.270 --> 04:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
directed to representative Nagel and
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
then representative Weber my
 
04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
understanding based on the earlier
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
testimonies this bill is going to be
 
04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
amended anyways would they amend the
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
dollar amount as well that would be up
 
04:47:04.868 --> 04:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
to you I would think Mr chairman
 
04:47:07.470 --> 04:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh we would we would not oppose reducing
 
04:47:09.310 --> 04:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
the appropriation because I I I don't
 
04:47:10.910 --> 04:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
think a million would would be required
 
04:47:14.030 --> 04:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
at this point thanks representative
 
04:47:17.190 --> 04:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
Weber was I understanding correctly that
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
the 40 to 50,000 was each or in the
 
04:47:23.670 --> 04:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
aggregate each so that those were from
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
five area agen okay so we would double
 
04:47:29.310 --> 04:47:29.320 align:start position:0%
we would multiply by 10 for that that
 
04:47:34.230 --> 04:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
was that was for absolutely and and am I
 
04:47:35.788 --> 04:47:35.798 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I'm really
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
relieved that we deal more with the
 
04:47:42.070 --> 04:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
health policy involved in this and then
 
04:47:44.670 --> 04:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
leave this to the cheerful mercies of
 
04:47:47.830 --> 04:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
the finance committee and I note that it
 
04:47:49.830 --> 04:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
was the bill was submitted on a
 
04:47:52.670 --> 04:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis by members of the
 
04:47:54.990 --> 04:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
finance committee so I I would believe
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
Weber representative
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair um this is
 
04:48:03.868 --> 04:48:03.878 align:start position:0%
more towards the policy than the finance
 
04:48:05.628 --> 04:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
but once it does get through Finance
 
04:48:07.788 --> 04:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
hopefully with some money attached to it
 
04:48:09.150 --> 04:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
any thoughts on how the money should be
 
04:48:10.868 --> 04:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
allocated should be done on a per capita
 
04:48:12.990 --> 04:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
basis done by individual Grant process I
 
04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
mean that's more of a poliy decision
 
04:48:16.948 --> 04:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
than really a finance one but give me
 
04:48:18.868 --> 04:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
thoughts we're certainly open to any
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
guard rails that are appropriate uh for
 
04:48:23.470 --> 04:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
example one of the things that's been um
 
04:48:25.548 --> 04:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
discussed is should should a licensed
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
therapist or physician have to uh back
 
04:48:31.628 --> 04:48:31.638 align:start position:0%
up these type of requests you know that
 
04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
could be something we could look at we
 
04:48:35.110 --> 04:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
could look because it's state doar we we
 
04:48:37.548 --> 04:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about any Medicaid
 
04:48:40.430 --> 04:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
rues so we can create the program
 
04:48:42.670 --> 04:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
basically any way that we we so Des
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
desire as a state so we're absolutely
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
open to more guard rules the bill as
 
04:48:49.990 --> 04:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
written I do agree with Melissa from HHS
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's very broad right now and it
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
leaves a lot of the decision making to
 
04:48:55.948 --> 04:48:55.958 align:start position:0%
the um to the department through Ru
 
04:48:57.470 --> 04:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
making but certainly we can bring
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
forward some ideas to to put some guard
 
04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
rails on the funds if that would be
 
04:49:04.150 --> 04:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
helpful follow up thank you Mr chair
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
today with CMS what is the process do
 
04:49:09.270 --> 04:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
they require a licensed provider to sign
 
04:49:10.750 --> 04:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
up on something is this basically
 
04:49:13.708 --> 04:49:13.718 align:start position:0%
something that I don't want to re create
 
04:49:15.670 --> 04:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
more bureaucracy here but right well and
 
04:49:16.948 --> 04:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
and right and when we were writing the
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
Bill that was I I think for most things
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
you probably would need a licensed uh
 
04:49:23.390 --> 04:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation to be covered Medicaid
 
04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
has a lot of different rules and and I
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
definitely agree with uh representative
 
04:49:30.750 --> 04:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
Nagel that CMS has caused a lot of
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
disruption in in the DD Community as as
 
04:49:34.868 --> 04:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
many of you know in the past couple of
 
04:49:37.230 --> 04:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
years and this is just another another
 
04:49:38.548 --> 04:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
situation where we're having to deal
 
04:49:40.990 --> 04:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
with that um so yeah it was a balance
 
04:49:43.110 --> 04:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know we we wanted to get the bill uh
 
04:49:45.628 --> 04:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
submitted and certainly um I'm not
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily advocating that that a
 
04:49:49.628 --> 04:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
licensed professional has to recommend a
 
04:49:51.310 --> 04:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
service or an item but but it is
 
04:49:53.070 --> 04:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
something that we have discussed and you
 
04:49:54.750 --> 04:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
know it may or may not be reasonable for
 
04:49:55.990 --> 04:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
some for some
 
04:49:58.628 --> 04:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
individuals representative Nel I'm
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
really struggling oh thank you Mr
 
04:50:02.910 --> 04:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you for taking my
 
04:50:04.830 --> 04:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
question I I'm really struggling with
 
04:50:06.390 --> 04:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
the whole licensed professional thing
 
04:50:08.670 --> 04:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
because I I really do understand in
 
04:50:10.750 --> 04:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances it makes sense I'm
 
04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
not sure that in this circumstance it
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
does we have all sorts of precedents in
 
04:50:17.230 --> 04:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
health care for Health Care memberships
 
04:50:18.910 --> 04:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
and things like that which this seems
 
04:50:21.150 --> 04:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
this to me to be analogus but my
 
04:50:23.270 --> 04:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
question is like what percentage of
 
04:50:26.590 --> 04:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
activities of these PE that adults and
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
children involved in that actually
 
04:50:30.510 --> 04:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
require they're using a licensed person
 
04:50:31.948 --> 04:50:31.958 align:start position:0%
now it sounds like a lot of them they're
 
04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
not I I I would agree the probably a lot
 
04:50:36.350 --> 04:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
of them are not it it it would be
 
04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
another hoop for folks to jump through
 
04:50:40.150 --> 04:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
but at the same time I think we want to
 
04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that the funds are used
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
responsibly and um we right now I feel
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly modest investment you
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
know 40 to 50,000 per area agency each
 
04:50:54.590 --> 04:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
Area Agency serves you know maybe a, to
 
04:50:57.788 --> 04:50:57.798 align:start position:0%
1500 people so again I will try to find
 
04:50:59.510 --> 04:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
out exactly in terms of folks on the
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
waiver and then if you add you know the
 
04:51:02.910 --> 04:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
children it's it's even more than that
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
so systemwide it's probably close to
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
13,000 individuals but not not all of
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
those folks are are on Medicaid so
 
04:51:13.150 --> 04:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
um I I think we need to have a
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
discussion in terms of the guard rails
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
that was just a suggestion that was that
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
was floated out there there there could
 
04:51:20.270 --> 04:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
be other other ideas that we could look
 
04:51:22.430 --> 04:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
at in terms of um making sure that the
 
04:51:26.948 --> 04:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
funds are used responsibly okay other
 
04:51:29.708 --> 04:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any all set don't
 
04:51:31.350 --> 04:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
forget the pink card please absolutely I
 
04:51:34.190 --> 04:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
won't thank you no no one else has
 
04:51:37.708 --> 04:51:37.718 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify on House Bill 1593
 
04:51:40.030 --> 04:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
FN does anyone else wish to
 
04:51:42.350 --> 04:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
testify seeing no one I'm going to close
 
04:51:45.510 --> 04:51:45.520 align:start position:0%

04:53:22.430 --> 04:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
hey good afternoon representative
 
04:53:24.628 --> 04:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
Shapiro although we've been talking to
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
you all day we we seeing you from a
 
04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:33.190 --> 04:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:53:35.390 --> 04:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
04:53:38.590 --> 04:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
um that will be this will be a hard act
 
04:53:41.110 --> 04:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
to follow um this an
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
impressive um display of advocacy
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
happening so I'm here today to introduce
 
04:53:51.910 --> 04:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1520
 
04:53:56.070 --> 04:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
1520 to you um a bill that will
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
establish a family assistance car
 
04:54:00.070 --> 04:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
ownership pilot program in the
 
04:54:02.430 --> 04:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to walk through a little
 
04:54:06.750 --> 04:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
bit about how I came to have this idea
 
04:54:07.990 --> 04:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
for this
 
04:54:08.000 --> 04:54:10.788 align:start position:0%
for this
bill

04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:54:14.310 --> 04:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
um in our committee it seems to me that
 
04:54:18.910 --> 04:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
we are frequently having um discussions
 
04:54:22.670 --> 04:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
about public benefits mostly Medicaid in
 
04:54:25.310 --> 04:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
this in this committee but about public
 
04:54:28.270 --> 04:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
benefits and to what degree public
 
04:54:31.190 --> 04:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
benefits create
 
04:54:34.708 --> 04:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
Health resiliency selfs efficiency and
 
04:54:36.470 --> 04:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
to what degree they
 
04:54:39.750 --> 04:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
create dependence and de incentivize
 
04:54:42.670 --> 04:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
people to go on with their lives and um
 
04:54:44.430 --> 04:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
so this is an issue that I've thought
 
04:54:46.470 --> 04:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
about a lot since I've been on this
 
04:54:49.350 --> 04:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
04:54:53.190 --> 04:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
and this is the this is my journey to
 
04:54:55.788 --> 04:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
try to solve a small part of that
 
04:54:59.430 --> 04:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
problem because I think both are true um
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
for some of us we probably think it's um
 
04:55:07.910 --> 04:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for ex existent for example um
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
mostly creates health and resiliency for
 
04:55:13.868 --> 04:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
some of us are more concerned about the
 
04:55:16.230 --> 04:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
fact that it might keep people from
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
moving on getting a full-time job Etc
 
04:55:21.788 --> 04:55:21.798 align:start position:0%
because they would lose their benefits
 
04:55:25.628 --> 04:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
so um respecting that both are true to
 
04:55:27.548 --> 04:55:27.558 align:start position:0%
some extent
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I started off looking about looking
 
04:55:34.990 --> 04:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
for what are the systemic obstacles that
 
04:55:38.030 --> 04:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
keep people stuck with public benefits
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
and that for people who haven't
 
04:55:44.510 --> 04:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
um explored this that is referred to as
 
04:55:50.670 --> 04:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
the um benefits Cliff effects and um the
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
probably the most obvious example is a
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
family is on Medicaid a parent is
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
working they're offered a higher paying
 
04:56:00.628 --> 04:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
job or they work offered more hours at
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
their job but they know that if they
 
04:56:06.270 --> 04:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
accept those hours and make more money
 
04:56:08.750 --> 04:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
that they will lose their Medicaid and
 
04:56:10.868 --> 04:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
they will have taken one step forward
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
and 10 steps backwards so there are
 
04:56:18.110 --> 04:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
systemic problems that keep people stuck
 
04:56:21.670 --> 04:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
on benefits so I was looking for um what
 
04:56:24.430 --> 04:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
can we do to solve those problems and
 
04:56:26.548 --> 04:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
much to my surprise I found out as a
 
04:56:29.590 --> 04:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
benefits Cliff effect group working
 
04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
group within DHHS that has been um was
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
was put into statue by hb4 in
 
04:56:39.310 --> 04:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
2019 and meet regularly and you can go
 
04:56:42.910 --> 04:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
on the DHHS website and look at the work
 
04:56:45.030 --> 04:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
that they've been doing and look at
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
various pilot projects that they've
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
created to try to mitigate these effects
 
04:56:53.230 --> 04:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
and help people move forward with their
 
04:56:55.350 --> 04:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
lives and i' recommend that everyone do
 
04:56:58.788 --> 04:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
that it's really kind of so Central to
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
what this committee is about um and I
 
04:57:04.470 --> 04:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
can give people myself somebody from D
 
04:57:07.310 --> 04:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
DHHS can give somebody the give people
 
04:57:10.548 --> 04:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
the link to go and and read about
 
04:57:10.558 --> 04:57:12.830 align:start position:0%
the link to go and and read about
that

04:57:12.830 --> 04:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:57:16.590 --> 04:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
um one of the obstacles that was defined
 
04:57:18.590 --> 04:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
but there's not currently a pilot
 
04:57:23.030 --> 04:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
project happening with is a problem with
 
04:57:23.040 --> 04:57:24.708 align:start position:0%
project happening with is a problem with
Transportation

04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
so um it was identified that especially
 
04:57:30.310 --> 04:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
people on
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
tanif temporary assistance for needy
 
04:57:39.310 --> 04:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.510 --> 04:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
that in order to work in order to work
 
04:57:45.310 --> 04:57:45.320 align:start position:0%
at a decent job in order to also like
 
04:57:47.868 --> 04:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
take care of your family um
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
transportation is a real problem um
 
04:57:52.350 --> 04:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
public transportation in New Hampshire
 
04:57:55.230 --> 04:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
is not sufficient and being a rural
 
04:57:59.190 --> 04:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
State um pretty much need a car to to do
 
04:58:02.030 --> 04:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
this so I was trying to help someone in
 
04:58:04.628 --> 04:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
my neighborhood Who who
 
04:58:07.110 --> 04:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
um for the last two years has been
 
04:58:10.750 --> 04:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
working as a
 
04:58:13.628 --> 04:58:13.638 align:start position:0%
um a maintenance person at chesher
 
04:58:17.030 --> 04:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
Medical Center so he works the night
 
04:58:21.670 --> 04:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
shift um doing custodial work
 
04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
and he has been riding his bike to
 
04:58:27.788 --> 04:58:27.798 align:start position:0%
chesher Medical Center about 2 miles
 
04:58:31.390 --> 04:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
from his home um every night at 10:00 to
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
get to work and every morning at 6: a.m.
 
04:58:38.270 --> 04:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
to get home and um that's summer fall
 
04:58:42.310 --> 04:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
spring and winter um so a bunch of us in
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
our neighborhood were trying to help um
 
04:58:46.708 --> 04:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
this fellow figure out how he could get
 
04:58:49.788 --> 04:58:49.798 align:start position:0%
a car drives he has a license I'm very
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
capable driver but he just didn't he you
 
04:58:55.110 --> 04:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
know supporting his family he's got
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
children he wasn't able to save enough
 
04:59:01.510 --> 04:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
money to buy a decent
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
car so um in the process of trying to
 
04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
help him someone came to me and said
 
04:59:10.910 --> 04:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
well have you tried good news garage
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
there are an organization that helps
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
people get cars and what I found out
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
when I looked into it is that the state
 
04:59:19.470 --> 04:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Department of Health
 
04:59:21.628 --> 04:59:21.638 align:start position:0%
and Human Services the vision of
 
04:59:25.590 --> 04:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
economic stability in DHHS used to have
 
04:59:28.830 --> 04:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
a contract with good news garage where
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
they got car donations they um fixed
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
cars up and they either um gave them to
 
04:59:39.150 --> 04:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
people or gave them to people there's
 
04:59:41.270 --> 04:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
somebody here from that organization who
 
04:59:43.310 --> 04:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
could talk about the specifics but they
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
help people acquire cars either with a
 
04:59:49.750 --> 04:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
contribution or not I'm not sure um
 
04:59:51.310 --> 04:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
however that in
 
04:59:55.430 --> 04:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
2017 that program which um DHHS had had
 
04:59:59.110 --> 04:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
a contract with for 15 years um was
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
discontinued um I'm not really sure why
 
05:00:06.310 --> 05:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
um and since that time good news garage
 
05:00:09.548 --> 05:00:09.558 align:start position:0%
takes donations of cars in Massachusetts
 
05:00:12.948 --> 05:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
Vermont and New Hampshire but only gives
 
05:00:15.670 --> 05:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
cars away in Vermont and
 
05:00:19.868 --> 05:00:19.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so this bill House Bill
 
05:00:23.910 --> 05:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
1520 is really an attempt to bring back
 
05:00:26.548 --> 05:00:26.558 align:start position:0%
that program for people on
 
05:00:31.350 --> 05:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
tanif um and to bring it back as a small
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
pilot project at first
 
05:00:36.070 --> 05:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
because after doing research and talking
 
05:00:37.750 --> 05:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
to people who are doing this kind of
 
05:00:41.510 --> 05:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
work um and and probably all of you know
 
05:00:45.390 --> 05:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
that the prices of cars have really
 
05:00:49.590 --> 05:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
um have been terribly inflated and
 
05:00:52.070 --> 05:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
also things being what they are people
 
05:00:55.150 --> 05:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
are less likely to get you get rid of a
 
05:00:58.910 --> 05:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
a quality used car so what used to be
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
the situation in terms of people
 
05:01:02.110 --> 05:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
donating the cars is much more
 
05:01:03.750 --> 05:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
challenging now and I'll let somebody
 
05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
else talk about that who knows more
 
05:01:09.030 --> 05:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
about that so we decided not to bring
 
05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
this back as a full-fledged program but
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
we decided to bring it back as a pil a
 
05:01:17.590 --> 05:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
small pilot program um to see if we
 
05:01:20.150 --> 05:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
could get this going and to
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
um to show success before we try to make
 
05:01:26.030 --> 05:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
it a more full-fledged larger program I
 
05:01:28.670 --> 05:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
think in the in the last fiscal year
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
that good news garage the F fiscal year
 
05:01:31.840 --> 05:01:33.830 align:start position:0%
that good news garage the F fiscal year
2016

05:01:33.830 --> 05:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
2016
 
05:01:36.670 --> 05:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
um when that contract between good news
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
garage and DHHS was in place there were
 
05:01:44.030 --> 05:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
100 cars given to people on
 
05:01:46.390 --> 05:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
TANF and we're not we're not looking to
 
05:01:48.390 --> 05:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
do that at all we're looking for a much
 
05:01:52.470 --> 05:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
smaller program and I was encouraged by
 
05:01:55.110 --> 05:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
um the people in division of economic
 
05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
stability to um make it a small program
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
but also in terms of writing the bill to
 
05:02:05.990 --> 05:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
make it purposefully vague so that they
 
05:02:08.190 --> 05:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
could work with a certain amount of
 
05:02:12.190 --> 05:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
money to get cars based on the current
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
cost of cars and ensure that those were
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
quality cars that were not going to like
 
05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
break down the moment that people got
 
05:02:21.070 --> 05:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
them um and also to ensure that the
 
05:02:23.070 --> 05:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
people who got them were able to keep
 
05:02:25.390 --> 05:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
them up and the people who got them were
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:33.788 --> 05:02:33.798 align:start position:0%
um you know to to to to meet some of the
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
criteria for um future success in terms
 
05:02:37.760 --> 05:02:43.070 align:start position:0%
criteria for um future success in terms
of

05:02:43.070 --> 05:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:46.670 --> 05:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
employability so I did pass out the
 
05:02:48.190 --> 05:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire Department of
 
05:02:50.310 --> 05:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services Bureau of
 
05:02:52.868 --> 05:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
improvement and Integrity Financial
 
05:02:56.110 --> 05:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
Compliance Unit review um I don't really
 
05:02:58.750 --> 05:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
know what that is but somebody in DHHS
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
did a review and I've passed that out to
 
05:03:03.628 --> 05:03:03.638 align:start position:0%
people and it really talks about the
 
05:03:06.150 --> 05:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
program that existed for 15 years within
 
05:03:11.190 --> 05:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
the department um and good news garage
 
05:03:14.948 --> 05:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
um and talks about some of the
 
05:03:18.670 --> 05:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
statistics about the effectiveness and
 
05:03:22.230 --> 05:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
um you can read it yourself really but
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
um it it does talk about the fact that
 
05:03:27.470 --> 05:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
in the last year 100 car 100 clients
 
05:03:27.480 --> 05:03:28.430 align:start position:0%
in the last year 100 car 100 clients
received

05:03:28.430 --> 05:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
received
 
05:03:31.590 --> 05:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
automobiles um that over the 15 years of
 
05:03:33.868 --> 05:03:33.878 align:start position:0%
the program it was estimated that you
 
05:03:36.628 --> 05:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
know approximately $1.3 million would
 
05:03:39.910 --> 05:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
have been saved in cash assistance and
 
05:03:42.788 --> 05:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
in um snap
 
05:03:45.230 --> 05:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
payments it also talked about that in
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
one of the particular years um 63% of
 
05:03:51.430 --> 05:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
the car recipients closed their tanif
 
05:03:53.910 --> 05:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
case within five months and there was a
 
05:03:57.670 --> 05:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
particularly low comparatively low level
 
05:03:59.948 --> 05:03:59.958 align:start position:0%
of recidivism with people going back on
 
05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
TANF for people who had received these
 
05:04:02.000 --> 05:04:03.670 align:start position:0%
TANF for people who had received these
cars

05:04:03.670 --> 05:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
cars
 
05:04:06.910 --> 05:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
um so you have that and you can look at
 
05:04:06.920 --> 05:04:11.230 align:start position:0%
um so you have that and you can look at
that

05:04:11.230 --> 05:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:13.868 --> 05:04:13.878 align:start position:0%
um one one thing that I didn't say when
 
05:04:17.030 --> 05:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
I talked about the actual bill which
 
05:04:19.948 --> 05:04:19.958 align:start position:0%
asks for appropriation of um
 
05:04:23.190 --> 05:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
$220,000 to start this program is that
 
05:04:26.470 --> 05:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
while good news garage um is here and is
 
05:04:28.390 --> 05:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
going to testify about their experience
 
05:04:32.150 --> 05:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the past um this kind of program is
 
05:04:34.350 --> 05:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
not this kind of Bill is not written for
 
05:04:36.708 --> 05:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
good news garage this bill is written so
 
05:04:40.548 --> 05:04:40.558 align:start position:0%
that um people within the Department of
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services would create
 
05:04:45.070 --> 05:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
the program and this would be put out to
 
05:04:49.070 --> 05:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
bid for people to provide um the
 
05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
Automobiles and the
 
05:04:54.788 --> 05:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
um the servicing of those Automobiles
 
05:04:54.798 --> 05:04:56.868 align:start position:0%
um the servicing of those Automobiles
and

05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
um the the whole program essentially
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
would be put out to bid with DHHS um
 
05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
setting the criteria for who got these
 
05:05:07.360 --> 05:05:10.708 align:start position:0%
setting the criteria for who got these
automobiles

05:05:10.708 --> 05:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:13.230 --> 05:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
so if you're interested in resilience
 
05:05:14.910 --> 05:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
and self-sufficiency and if you're
 
05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
interested in people going off um
 
05:05:21.510 --> 05:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
Federal benefits and state benefits I
 
05:05:23.190 --> 05:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
hope you will agree with me that this is
 
05:05:26.830 --> 05:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
a good idea and um vote to support this
 
05:05:29.070 --> 05:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm very willing to take
 
05:05:32.270 --> 05:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative Murphy
 
05:05:33.628 --> 05:05:33.638 align:start position:0%
thank Mr chairman and thank you taking
 
05:05:35.230 --> 05:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
my question so I just want to be clear
 
05:05:37.788 --> 05:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
so this is an ownership program they own
 
05:05:40.868 --> 05:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
the car they are responsible for service
 
05:05:42.750 --> 05:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
of the car maintenance of the car they
 
05:05:44.350 --> 05:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
could even potentially then sell the car
 
05:05:46.830 --> 05:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
down the road when it get to be you know
 
05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
a bit more of a vintage age is that
 
05:05:53.270 --> 05:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
correct yes that is correct I I think
 
05:05:55.910 --> 05:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
you should ask that question also to the
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
um people from the um from DHS DHHS who
 
05:06:05.310 --> 05:06:05.320 align:start position:0%
would actually run the program and um
 
05:06:06.830 --> 05:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
and you could also ask that question of
 
05:06:09.150 --> 05:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
people from Good News garage who who ran
 
05:06:10.628 --> 05:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
a similar program with the state
 
05:06:12.270 --> 05:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
obviously there would be a problem if
 
05:06:14.510 --> 05:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
people just turned around and sold the
 
05:06:17.350 --> 05:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
car for a profit and um we certainly
 
05:06:18.948 --> 05:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want that that would be counter
 
05:06:24.110 --> 05:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
to the I whole idea um and um I imagine
 
05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
that that would be built into the
 
05:06:31.390 --> 05:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
program other questions representative
 
05:06:34.470 --> 05:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
Nel thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm involved in a
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
lot of committees where transportation
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
is a huge issue and I'm just wanted to
 
05:06:43.230 --> 05:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
make sure I understood this is for
 
05:06:46.350 --> 05:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
employment only right or because for
 
05:06:48.788 --> 05:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
example um on the opio abatement
 
05:06:50.510 --> 05:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
commission one of our big issues is how
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
to people get to inform Services
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
especially in the North country and we
 
05:06:57.070 --> 05:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
were working on Transportation solutions
 
05:06:59.390 --> 05:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
for that could this be used for that or
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
is it just
 
05:07:01.320 --> 05:07:05.150 align:start position:0%
is it just
employment

05:07:05.150 --> 05:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:08.390 --> 05:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
two things one is that
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
um people within
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
the division of economic stability would
 
05:07:17.548 --> 05:07:17.558 align:start position:0%
actually create the rules for the
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
program um and develop the criteria for
 
05:07:22.470 --> 05:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
who was going to get cars this is
 
05:07:23.830 --> 05:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
obviously not a thing where everyone
 
05:07:26.510 --> 05:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
gets a car um you just have to be on
 
05:07:30.150 --> 05:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
tanif and you get a car um so um people
 
05:07:33.948 --> 05:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
within DHHS would set the criteria and
 
05:07:38.628 --> 05:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
write those rules um in my mind this is
 
05:07:41.310 --> 05:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
a major element is
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
employability and that this should be
 
05:07:45.910 --> 05:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
aimed at
 
05:07:45.920 --> 05:07:48.310 align:start position:0%
aimed at
people

05:07:48.310 --> 05:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:07:51.030 --> 05:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
achieving employment or improved
 
05:07:53.310 --> 05:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
employment so they can actually go off
 
05:07:57.350 --> 05:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
of these benefits but clearly um it
 
05:08:00.190 --> 05:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
would also it is also necessary and very
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
useful for people to be able to get to
 
05:08:03.990 --> 05:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
Medical appointments for people to take
 
05:08:05.948 --> 05:08:05.958 align:start position:0%
care of their kids for people to get to
 
05:08:08.270 --> 05:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
school meetings and these are all the
 
05:08:09.390 --> 05:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that are really
 
05:08:11.230 --> 05:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
challenging for people who don't have
 
05:08:14.030 --> 05:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
transportation and don't have money to
 
05:08:16.390 --> 05:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
um obtain
 
05:08:19.150 --> 05:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation so it's not a it's not a
 
05:08:22.390 --> 05:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
one or the other um but it's mainly in
 
05:08:25.510 --> 05:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
my mind directed at um
 
05:08:30.110 --> 05:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also so
 
05:08:33.310 --> 05:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
05:08:33.320 --> 05:08:34.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
representative

05:08:34.350 --> 05:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:08:36.190 --> 05:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
Sparrow first of all I want to commend
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
you because in our neck of the woods up
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
here in Sullivan County where I reside
 
05:08:42.070 --> 05:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh transportation in the rural part of
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is extremely challenging
 
05:08:46.150 --> 05:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
um it's one of the major reasons why
 
05:08:48.430 --> 05:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
people can't get to medical appointments
 
05:08:49.948 --> 05:08:49.958 align:start position:0%
are work as well so I want to say thank
 
05:08:52.110 --> 05:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
you for introducing the bill a couple of
 
05:08:55.750 --> 05:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
questions on the bill on the fiscal note
 
05:08:58.670 --> 05:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
on line on page I know it's page three
 
05:09:00.948 --> 05:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
whatever the fiscal note is it talks
 
05:09:03.070 --> 05:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
about having a pilot program
 
05:09:06.670 --> 05:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
report submitted by November 1st
 
05:09:08.868 --> 05:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
2024 given the fact that the bill is
 
05:09:13.110 --> 05:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
going to become active on July 1 2024
 
05:09:14.910 --> 05:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
that believe allows about 3 months to
 
05:09:17.708 --> 05:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
collect data is three months sufficient
 
05:09:19.948 --> 05:09:19.958 align:start position:0%
to collect data in order to give a full
 
05:09:22.390 --> 05:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
report about the benefits of it it's not
 
05:09:23.868 --> 05:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
just a question about the car but also
 
05:09:25.868 --> 05:09:25.878 align:start position:0%
the benefits of the recipient what they
 
05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
can do what they have done back before
 
05:09:30.548 --> 05:09:30.558 align:start position:0%
that's the question to you do you think
 
05:09:34.190 --> 05:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
that should go to 20 2025 versus 2024
 
05:09:35.868 --> 05:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
it's on the fiscal note which is next
 
05:09:39.150 --> 05:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
right well I would say that it would be
 
05:09:46.270 --> 05:09:46.280 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point um but I would
 
05:09:48.628 --> 05:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
say that it would be appropriate to be
 
05:09:50.230 --> 05:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
able to
 
05:09:52.590 --> 05:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
report what progress they have in
 
05:09:54.270 --> 05:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
determining what the program is going to
 
05:09:57.788 --> 05:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
be by then um you know in how you know
 
05:09:59.548 --> 05:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
and how far they've gotten to setting
 
05:10:04.150 --> 05:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
criteria and um how far they got in um
 
05:10:06.910 --> 05:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
Contracting this program with somebody
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
um but clearly they're not going to have
 
05:10:11.470 --> 05:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
data on
 
05:10:14.390 --> 05:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
um the actual program and how successful
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
it is by
 
05:10:19.910 --> 05:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.270 --> 05:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
up thank
 
05:10:24.670 --> 05:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
you and then the other question I have
 
05:10:29.270 --> 05:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
is where M with the Department back in
 
05:10:31.708 --> 05:10:31.718 align:start position:0%
2017 how much state was spending on the
 
05:10:33.670 --> 05:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
program and why it was discontinued do
 
05:10:34.910 --> 05:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
you have any information about that I
 
05:10:36.230 --> 05:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
should leave that for Department of
 
05:10:37.510 --> 05:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
Health Human
 
05:10:37.520 --> 05:10:39.190 align:start position:0%
Health Human
Services

05:10:39.190 --> 05:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
Services
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
um I do not know why it was discontinued
 
05:10:44.830 --> 05:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
although obviously you know in a budget
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
year people go over the budget with a
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
fine tooth comb and some years are
 
05:10:52.270 --> 05:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
were're more flush than other years and
 
05:10:52.280 --> 05:10:55.350 align:start position:0%
were're more flush than other years and
sometimes

05:10:55.350 --> 05:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:58.030 --> 05:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
um you know somebody doesn't like what
 
05:10:59.628 --> 05:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
they see in the budget or somebody has
 
05:11:01.548 --> 05:11:01.558 align:start position:0%
another idea for how the budget money in
 
05:11:03.948 --> 05:11:03.958 align:start position:0%
the budget should be used that um they
 
05:11:05.670 --> 05:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
think is more important so I don't know
 
05:11:07.750 --> 05:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
the details on that I will say that in
 
05:11:12.350 --> 05:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
this review of the program they do say
 
05:11:14.590 --> 05:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
that there were never any compliance
 
05:11:17.708 --> 05:11:17.718 align:start position:0%
issues with the program or disputes
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
within the program and um the department
 
05:11:23.948 --> 05:11:23.958 align:start position:0%
so I I I don't I don't really know the
 
05:11:26.548 --> 05:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
answer to that question I do know that
 
05:11:30.150 --> 05:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
at one point
 
05:11:34.030 --> 05:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
um the vendor good news garage who was
 
05:11:36.590 --> 05:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
handling this um and they can talk more
 
05:11:41.590 --> 05:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
to this um was the amount of money it
 
05:11:47.708 --> 05:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
took per car per client was um
 
05:11:49.910 --> 05:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
something lower than
 
05:11:52.430 --> 05:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
$6,000 and I think when we would when I
 
05:11:56.390 --> 05:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
was discussing this with Karen Hebert of
 
05:12:00.110 --> 05:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
um the division of economic stability um
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
one reason she wanted it WR without too
 
05:12:06.150 --> 05:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
many specifics is that the cost of cars
 
05:12:07.948 --> 05:12:07.958 align:start position:0%
has gone up tremendously and the
 
05:12:10.230 --> 05:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
availability of donated cars has gone
 
05:12:13.788 --> 05:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
down so they wanted more flexibility to
 
05:12:16.390 --> 05:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
create a program that would really work
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
I mean just like we don't want people
 
05:12:20.350 --> 05:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
selling cars after we give them we also
 
05:12:22.150 --> 05:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
don't want them to like break down
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
immediately after after they get cars
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh point of
 
05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
correction uh represent Weber pointed
 
05:12:33.868 --> 05:12:33.878 align:start position:0%
out to me on page two of the bill it
 
05:12:35.708 --> 05:12:35.718 align:start position:0%
does say the report will be done by
 
05:12:38.070 --> 05:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
November 1st of 2024 but then annually
 
05:12:42.110 --> 05:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
thereafter so thank
 
05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative
 
05:12:47.230 --> 05:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you and thank you for
 
05:12:50.110 --> 05:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I know it's been
 
05:12:53.670 --> 05:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
Al alluded to several times um before my
 
05:12:56.670 --> 05:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
question but I am interested if not by
 
05:13:00.070 --> 05:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
you um by someone from DHHS or good news
 
05:13:03.070 --> 05:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
garage of of what is in place to prevent
 
05:13:05.590 --> 05:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
someone from receiving a car and then
 
05:13:08.110 --> 05:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
immediately selling it so I know you
 
05:13:10.750 --> 05:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
can't answer that I am too so okay thank

05:13:57.040 --> 05:13:58.030 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Department of Health and
Human

05:13:58.030 --> 05:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
Human
 
05:14:00.830 --> 05:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
Services um so I'm here to testify as to
 
05:14:02.708 --> 05:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do which is to
 
05:14:06.430 --> 05:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
create a small pilot program that would
 
05:14:10.948 --> 05:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
address the single greatest um problem
 
05:14:15.430 --> 05:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
with people on nhp returning to
 
05:14:18.390 --> 05:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
work and I'm here to answer any
 
05:14:21.430 --> 05:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
questions if the committee has
 
05:14:25.230 --> 05:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
any okay um actually I have one I was in
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
the department for a long time and I
 
05:14:29.390 --> 05:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
dealt with the tanif program for a long
 
05:14:32.310 --> 05:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
time uh but I've all so been retired now
 
05:14:34.470 --> 05:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
for about almost 5 years so I've forgot
 
05:14:35.830 --> 05:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
05:14:38.548 --> 05:14:38.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um we're talking about uh
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
employability uh is one of the reasons
 
05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
to have a car um is there a tan of work
 
05:14:47.270 --> 05:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
requirement or job search requirement I
 
05:14:48.708 --> 05:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
think there was one at one time but I
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if there still
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
is uh yes there is okay yeah okay makes
 
05:14:57.910 --> 05:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
sense representative
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and take thank you for
 
05:15:02.190 --> 05:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question I wonder if either of
 
05:15:05.868 --> 05:15:05.878 align:start position:0%
you could answer the question about when
 
05:15:08.990 --> 05:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
the prior program existed how did we
 
05:15:10.910 --> 05:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that people didn't just sell the
 
05:15:14.070 --> 05:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
car because clearly that wasn't the case
 
05:15:15.470 --> 05:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I haven't had time to read that
 
05:15:18.788 --> 05:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
whole document but um I wonder what the
 
05:15:21.070 --> 05:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
safeguards were to ensure that the car
 
05:15:26.590 --> 05:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:29.590 --> 05:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
purposes so there was no actual
 
05:15:32.948 --> 05:15:32.958 align:start position:0%
Safeguard when an individual
 
05:15:36.430 --> 05:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
did receive a vehicle they ultimately
 
05:15:38.590 --> 05:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
had the ownership of the vehicle the
 
05:15:40.750 --> 05:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
title registration they were responsible
 
05:15:44.350 --> 05:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
for all that however what we did do is
 
05:15:46.590 --> 05:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
we educated individuals on the
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
importance of maintaining a car in order
 
05:15:53.830 --> 05:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
for them to remain employed to help with
 
05:15:57.070 --> 05:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
their family to be sustainable in terms
 
05:15:59.430 --> 05:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
of getting individuals to doctor's
 
05:16:01.868 --> 05:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
appointments uh other types of
 
05:16:03.510 --> 05:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
appointments that would otherwise keep
 
05:16:05.868 --> 05:16:05.878 align:start position:0%
them recidivating back onto the program
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
but there was no actual way of ever
 
05:16:10.750 --> 05:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
prohibiting that now being involved in
 
05:16:13.270 --> 05:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
the program for many of
 
05:16:16.788 --> 05:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
years I never heard of one incident
 
05:16:19.230 --> 05:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
where an individual turned around and
 
05:16:22.470 --> 05:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
sold the car for profit once they
 
05:16:23.910 --> 05:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
received it from Good News garage there
 
05:16:27.910 --> 05:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
was no incidences ever reported but um
 
05:16:30.430 --> 05:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
so moving forward can we put some
 
05:16:32.070 --> 05:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place something that we
 
05:16:34.110 --> 05:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
can take up as a certainly as a
 
05:16:36.430 --> 05:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
consideration and as a safeguard moving
 
05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
forward with if in the event These funds
 
05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:45.150 --> 05:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
purpose what if it wasn't a problem we
 
05:16:49.110 --> 05:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
don't need to now representative
 
05:16:51.948 --> 05:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
Canon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:16:54.430 --> 05:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question what happens to the
 
05:16:57.830 --> 05:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
car if um the individual that's been
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
given to loses their
 
05:17:04.750 --> 05:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
job they keep the car yeah still their
 
05:17:08.510 --> 05:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
car um what typically would happen also
 
05:17:11.670 --> 05:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
if an individual would lose their job
 
05:17:15.868 --> 05:17:15.878 align:start position:0%
they would come back onto tanif in order
 
05:17:17.788 --> 05:17:17.798 align:start position:0%
in a way to help support their family
 
05:17:20.350 --> 05:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
and then we would reh help them
 
05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
integrate back into finding a new job or
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh appropriately participating in the
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
nhp program to put them through some
 
05:17:32.230 --> 05:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
type of education and train training to
 
05:17:34.670 --> 05:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
get another job okay
 
05:17:38.548 --> 05:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative kosman
 
05:17:39.868 --> 05:17:39.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:17:42.350 --> 05:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my question um I'm
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
wondering my husband's a mechanic and we
 
05:17:46.548 --> 05:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
are used cars car people we've never had
 
05:17:51.110 --> 05:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
a a new car ever and with used cars come
 
05:17:53.310 --> 05:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of Maintenance even when
 
05:17:55.548 --> 05:17:55.558 align:start position:0%
you think that your car is all set my
 
05:17:57.590 --> 05:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
husband's done the one over the two over
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
the three over of my vehicle and fixed a
 
05:18:01.470 --> 05:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
bunch of things and then we bring
 
05:18:02.990 --> 05:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
inference inspection and all of a sudden
 
05:18:04.350 --> 05:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
there's a new code that we never thought
 
05:18:07.990 --> 05:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
was going to be there um so my question
 
05:18:10.030 --> 05:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
is does the depart is the department
 
05:18:12.510 --> 05:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
going to have any continuing
 
05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that car once the
 
05:18:15.670 --> 05:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
ownership is
 
05:18:18.670 --> 05:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
transferred and should we put that in
 
05:18:20.110 --> 05:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
the bill somewhere and make it clear
 
05:18:21.708 --> 05:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
that they will
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
not uh it's that's a great question uh I
 
05:18:28.270 --> 05:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
can tell you in past contracts that
 
05:18:32.150 --> 05:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
we've had um with good news garage
 
05:18:35.590 --> 05:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
that there was a
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
um a a policy in there that helped us
 
05:18:41.590 --> 05:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
with maintenance requirements to the
 
05:18:44.110 --> 05:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles for a certain period of time
 
05:18:48.390 --> 05:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
and I think at that point it was I
 
05:18:51.270 --> 05:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
believe in between six or nine months
 
05:18:54.670 --> 05:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
from when the individual received the
 
05:18:57.310 --> 05:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle um though that was written into
 
05:18:59.788 --> 05:18:59.798 align:start position:0%
our contract that good news garage was
 
05:19:02.230 --> 05:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for helping with the
 
05:19:03.868 --> 05:19:03.878 align:start position:0%
maintenance of vehicles in the event
 
05:19:06.150 --> 05:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
something happened that was outside of
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
the control of the owner of the
 
05:19:13.110 --> 05:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle um they would um they would be
 
05:19:16.788 --> 05:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
sure to rectify any issues when uh when
 
05:19:18.470 --> 05:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
something went wrong we had excellent
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
relationships with uh good news garage
 
05:19:22.548 --> 05:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
uh we could certainly make a phone call
 
05:19:24.390 --> 05:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our participant or the
 
05:19:26.788 --> 05:19:26.798 align:start position:0%
participant could call thems and say
 
05:19:28.430 --> 05:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
this went wrong and they'd be like bring
 
05:19:30.788 --> 05:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
it in we'll we'll look at it we'll
 
05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
address it and we'll fix
 
05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
questions see none okay thank you very

futures

05:20:15.868 --> 05:20:15.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:18.750 --> 05:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
no you need you needed
 
05:20:22.390 --> 05:20:22.400 align:start position:0%

name's Brianna hle I'm from New Futures
 
05:20:27.390 --> 05:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
I'm the legal policy fellow at new
 
05:20:30.190 --> 05:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
Futures we focus on how to improve lives
 
05:20:32.470 --> 05:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
and wellbeing in New New Hampshire
 
05:20:35.070 --> 05:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
through policy change um I can't talk
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
much about the technical questions that
 
05:20:38.470 --> 05:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
have been coming up but I can talk about
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
the importance that new future sees in
 
05:20:43.948 --> 05:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
this program um uh there's only 34
 
05:20:46.430 --> 05:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire that has
 
05:20:48.230 --> 05:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
access to public transportation so
 
05:20:50.070 --> 05:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
especially in the rural areas they can
 
05:20:53.430 --> 05:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
really struggle um and people in general
 
05:20:55.390 --> 05:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
when they add additional weeks of work
 
05:20:57.628 --> 05:20:57.638 align:start position:0%
it go uh their cost of Transportation
 
05:20:58.830 --> 05:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
goes up by
 
05:21:01.670 --> 05:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
$200 and so this program would help um
 
05:21:04.230 --> 05:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
reduce costs and also help people in
 
05:21:08.070 --> 05:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
rural areas to get to work
 
05:21:10.628 --> 05:21:10.638 align:start position:0%
um sorry to get brief but is there any
 
05:21:14.990 --> 05:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
questions or anything any
 
05:21:17.310 --> 05:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you

05:22:19.708 --> 05:22:19.718 align:start position:0%
uh this H this house bill 1520 and a
 
05:22:21.628 --> 05:22:21.638 align:start position:0%
vendor like good news garage can have on
 
05:22:24.510 --> 05:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
granite Staters um I've been in health
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
and human services for for the large
 
05:22:28.868 --> 05:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
part of my career I also try to address
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
all the questions that I heard um
 
05:22:34.030 --> 05:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
succinctly it's outcomes are sometimes
 
05:22:35.868 --> 05:22:35.878 align:start position:0%
hard to find in Health and Human
 
05:22:38.750 --> 05:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
Services uh when I took the job at the
 
05:22:41.350 --> 05:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
head of good news garage four years ago
 
05:22:43.230 --> 05:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
I loved it because the outcomes were so
 
05:22:45.430 --> 05:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
concrete um it spoke to both sides of
 
05:22:48.110 --> 05:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
the political aisle it was such an easy
 
05:22:50.310 --> 05:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
program to Market and speak about when
 
05:22:52.190 --> 05:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
you give someone a car when you give
 
05:22:54.510 --> 05:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
someone a ride you see the difference it
 
05:22:56.230 --> 05:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
makes in their lives when you give them
 
05:22:59.390 --> 05:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
a ride time and time again um and I say
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
give a ride we do operate two program so
 
05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
we have our car donation program good
 
05:23:04.910 --> 05:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
news garage also has a transportation
 
05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
program where where we provide um van
 
05:23:10.670 --> 05:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
individual or congregate transport um to
 
05:23:13.548 --> 05:23:13.558 align:start position:0%
folks all over to get to appointments
 
05:23:15.670 --> 05:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
work um
 
05:23:18.548 --> 05:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
employment and when you're giving
 
05:23:20.910 --> 05:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
someone a ride over and over again for
 
05:23:22.868 --> 05:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
weeks on end so they can keep their job
 
05:23:24.310 --> 05:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
and you see them move towards more
 
05:23:26.110 --> 05:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
stability in their life and
 
05:23:28.230 --> 05:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency you see the emotional
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
impact that has on them and it's big
 
05:23:32.350 --> 05:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
it's huge so i' I've seen it firsthand
 
05:23:34.030 --> 05:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
and I want to testify to the importance
 
05:23:36.270 --> 05:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
of that and I believe this bill is a
 
05:23:37.868 --> 05:23:37.878 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction I live here
 
05:23:40.310 --> 05:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire myself um and I would
 
05:23:42.868 --> 05:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
love to see good news garage or a
 
05:23:44.510 --> 05:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
version of this bill being in place for
 
05:23:47.270 --> 05:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
granite sters transportation is a huge
 
05:23:50.270 --> 05:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
issue um good news garage started about
 
05:23:52.590 --> 05:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
28 years ago in Burlington Vermont very
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
Grassroots such as representative
 
05:23:55.948 --> 05:23:55.958 align:start position:0%
Shapiro mentioned where he was helping
 
05:23:58.270 --> 05:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
someone in his community um a guy in the
 
05:24:00.110 --> 05:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
Lutheran Community up in Vermont
 
05:24:02.030 --> 05:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
realized that people in his congregation
 
05:24:03.270 --> 05:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't didn't have the money to fix
 
05:24:06.070 --> 05:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
their cars and he knew how to fix cars
 
05:24:09.390 --> 05:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
so he started fixing cars and gain some
 
05:24:14.030 --> 05:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
traction um we've given over 5,500 cars
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
to new englanders uh in the past two
 
05:24:18.990 --> 05:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
decades uh annually we provide about
 
05:24:21.070 --> 05:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
15,000 rides through our ready to go
 
05:24:24.070 --> 05:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
program it's serious impact uh and I
 
05:24:25.590 --> 05:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
think it's really important and I think
 
05:24:27.430 --> 05:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
it direct uh addresses some of these
 
05:24:30.110 --> 05:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation needs head on in terms of
 
05:24:32.670 --> 05:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
the structure of program um I will
 
05:24:33.868 --> 05:24:33.878 align:start position:0%
attempt to answer a couple of the
 
05:24:36.390 --> 05:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
representatives questions quickly here
 
05:24:38.548 --> 05:24:38.558 align:start position:0%
uh historically good news garage does
 
05:24:41.270 --> 05:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
provide car ownership uh to the to the
 
05:24:43.868 --> 05:24:43.878 align:start position:0%
person receiving the car and we think
 
05:24:45.788 --> 05:24:45.798 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing right because it it
 
05:24:47.708 --> 05:24:47.718 align:start position:0%
provides dignity it provides that
 
05:24:51.070 --> 05:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency that folks want um we
 
05:24:53.628 --> 05:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
have uh this the program is structured
 
05:24:55.270 --> 05:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
different ways and different states
 
05:24:57.430 --> 05:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
depending on our partners right um to
 
05:24:59.708 --> 05:24:59.718 align:start position:0%
answer representative kushman's question
 
05:25:01.948 --> 05:25:01.958 align:start position:0%
we do warranty the vehicles in all our
 
05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
contracts like for instance in Vermont
 
05:25:05.868 --> 05:25:05.878 align:start position:0%
we warranted them for a year uh the way
 
05:25:07.230 --> 05:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
that program structured is the
 
05:25:08.590 --> 05:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
individual will have to come in
 
05:25:10.590 --> 05:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
quarterly and check in with good news
 
05:25:12.430 --> 05:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
garage as well as their case manager
 
05:25:15.150 --> 05:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
through the state um and if they get
 
05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
their oil change and check the car in
 
05:25:18.910 --> 05:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
then that's free of charge right and if
 
05:25:20.788 --> 05:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
anything needs to be fixed we fix it
 
05:25:23.270 --> 05:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's part of the contract that is a GU
 
05:25:24.590 --> 05:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
I would answer that that's a guard rail
 
05:25:25.910 --> 05:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
to some of the other Representatives
 
05:25:28.390 --> 05:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
questions around selling the car because
 
05:25:30.110 --> 05:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically we're trying to
 
05:25:30.120 --> 05:25:31.270 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically we're trying to
instill

05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
instill
 
05:25:33.708 --> 05:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
um that self ownership of the car and
 
05:25:35.510 --> 05:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
and part of that is the education of how
 
05:25:37.270 --> 05:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
to take care of your car and of course
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
so we're going to take care of this for
 
05:25:40.510 --> 05:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
the first year of you if you do these
 
05:25:40.520 --> 05:25:42.150 align:start position:0%
the first year of you if you do these
steps

05:25:42.150 --> 05:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
steps
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
um so to I think another question was
 
05:25:48.990 --> 05:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
asked around the the safeguards you know
 
05:25:50.670 --> 05:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
historically here in New Hampshire and
 
05:25:52.670 --> 05:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
as well in Massachusetts and Vermont
 
05:25:54.948 --> 05:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
there isn't actually a concrete
 
05:25:57.708 --> 05:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
Safeguard around the titling of the car
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
so there is nothing to be clear there is
 
05:26:01.628 --> 05:26:01.638 align:start position:0%
nothing to prevent recipient to go
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
around and sell that car in my four
 
05:26:05.430 --> 05:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
years and what I've been able to track
 
05:26:07.548 --> 05:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
it it echoes um the gentleman's from
 
05:26:11.390 --> 05:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS here uh we rarely see it I'm not
 
05:26:13.270 --> 05:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
going to say never we have seen it once
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
or twice where someone does lose a job
 
05:26:19.270 --> 05:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
um or you know uh with the OPI epidemic
 
05:26:20.948 --> 05:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
they might fall back into addiction
 
05:26:22.510 --> 05:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
something happens and they've sold that
 
05:26:25.868 --> 05:26:25.878 align:start position:0%
car but I would say if you know and this
 
05:26:29.190 --> 05:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
is anecdotal but in 5,500 gives I can
 
05:26:32.190 --> 05:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
only find a couple in 10 years that were
 
05:26:35.910 --> 05:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
sold um and I think uh to speak to
 
05:26:38.350 --> 05:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's um comment
 
05:26:40.910 --> 05:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
about the flexibility that um they want
 
05:26:43.070 --> 05:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
this Bild to be designed in the program
 
05:26:45.030 --> 05:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
design additional safeguards could be
 
05:26:48.390 --> 05:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
put in I think uh our experience with
 
05:26:50.190 --> 05:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
the state prior and in the other states
 
05:26:52.350 --> 05:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
that we operate no one really wants to
 
05:26:55.150 --> 05:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
be the Repo Man right so if we hold the
 
05:26:57.628 --> 05:26:57.638 align:start position:0%
title that would be the kind of initial
 
05:27:00.110 --> 05:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
or if the state holds the title right no
 
05:27:01.948 --> 05:27:01.958 align:start position:0%
no one can sell a car however then we
 
05:27:05.430 --> 05:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
have to go repo a car um and that can be
 
05:27:07.990 --> 05:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
maybe not cost effective um maybe add
 
05:27:09.430 --> 05:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
some bureaucratic onus but there are
 
05:27:11.948 --> 05:27:11.958 align:start position:0%
some options here in program design to
 
05:27:13.948 --> 05:27:13.958 align:start position:0%
look at additional safeguards but a lot
 
05:27:16.070 --> 05:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the safeguards do Echo um the
 
05:27:17.310 --> 05:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
gentleman here from Health and Human
 
05:27:19.510 --> 05:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
Services where we really want to instill
 
05:27:21.350 --> 05:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
the Dignity of car ownership and we
 
05:27:23.548 --> 05:27:23.558 align:start position:0%
incentivize that by staying with the
 
05:27:25.548 --> 05:27:25.558 align:start position:0%
program for whatever determined amount
 
05:27:27.510 --> 05:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
of time and you will get your repairs
 
05:27:29.830 --> 05:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
for free you know you will get your car
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
warrantied and we will keep you on the
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
word on the road towards economic
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency so in conclusion um I
 
05:27:38.390 --> 05:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
think the only other thing I wanted to
 
05:27:40.590 --> 05:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
prepare you know we have lots of data at
 
05:27:44.270 --> 05:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
good news garage um personal testimonies
 
05:27:46.230 --> 05:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
we Market them so that we can get
 
05:27:48.270 --> 05:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
donations from community
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
members two years ago uh in my personal
 
05:27:53.948 --> 05:27:53.958 align:start position:0%
life I like Recreation and Athletics I
 
05:27:55.470 --> 05:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
was at the health club I was playing
 
05:27:57.708 --> 05:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
basketball I was talking to a friend of
 
05:27:59.390 --> 05:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
mine and his wife asked what I did for
 
05:28:02.750 --> 05:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
work and I said oh I run um a local New
 
05:28:04.868 --> 05:28:04.878 align:start position:0%
England nonprofit when we give cars to
 
05:28:06.708 --> 05:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
people in need and she said oh good news
 
05:28:10.510 --> 05:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
garage and I said yeah and she started
 
05:28:12.390 --> 05:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh crying tears of joy and she said
 
05:28:14.510 --> 05:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
eight years ago you know I was at a low
 
05:28:16.670 --> 05:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
point in my life I just had my son I'd
 
05:28:19.150 --> 05:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
lost my job and I got a car from Good
 
05:28:21.548 --> 05:28:21.558 align:start position:0%
News garage and enabled me to get a new
 
05:28:24.670 --> 05:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
job and stabilize myself she's happily
 
05:28:26.788 --> 05:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
married to my friend works at Fidelity
 
05:28:29.470 --> 05:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
for four years now and she attributed it
 
05:28:32.750 --> 05:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
to that car starting her life over it
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
hit me home because I wasn't on the
 
05:28:37.670 --> 05:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
clock you know um and I think that is
 
05:28:39.548 --> 05:28:39.558 align:start position:0%
maybe a good story of the power of what
 
05:28:42.230 --> 05:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
this bill can do for granite Staters
 
05:28:45.190 --> 05:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for um this
 
05:28:48.150 --> 05:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
gentleman a representative kman thank
 
05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
you um can you describe to us like what
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
say I come in with a car and I want to
 
05:28:58.230 --> 05:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
donate it um what the process is for
 
05:29:01.030 --> 05:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
once it comes in the door and then
 
05:29:03.510 --> 05:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
um like what you guys do to it you know
 
05:29:05.470 --> 05:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
how you check it over and everything
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely it it differs a little
 
05:29:09.230 --> 05:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
bit depending on where we operate but in
 
05:29:10.868 --> 05:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
general you know we get donations from
 
05:29:13.948 --> 05:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
all over New England we have staff um
 
05:29:16.070 --> 05:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
who have car backgrounds right and
 
05:29:18.350 --> 05:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
they'll evaluate that donation on paper
 
05:29:21.470 --> 05:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
right and a lot of times you know people
 
05:29:23.830 --> 05:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
donate junk right and so we we basically
 
05:29:25.628 --> 05:29:25.638 align:start position:0%
go through a screening process to see
 
05:29:27.628 --> 05:29:27.638 align:start position:0%
what um we think the car is going to be
 
05:29:29.990 --> 05:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
fixable we will tow a car in or go pick
 
05:29:31.548 --> 05:29:31.558 align:start position:0%
up a car car depending on geographic
 
05:29:34.750 --> 05:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
location and evaluate the car uh through
 
05:29:36.708 --> 05:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
basically a network of mechanics we used
 
05:29:38.590 --> 05:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
to have brick and mortar garages where
 
05:29:40.750 --> 05:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
we actually had our own service teams
 
05:29:43.350 --> 05:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
but um in the years since we've kind of
 
05:29:45.310 --> 05:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
subcontract that out so to speak so we
 
05:29:47.590 --> 05:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
have networks of mechanics and you know
 
05:29:49.190 --> 05:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
if someone in suvin County if we don't
 
05:29:50.868 --> 05:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
have you know we got to get in there and
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
so we'll build a relationship with a
 
05:29:55.110 --> 05:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
garage or or like your husband for
 
05:29:57.548 --> 05:29:57.558 align:start position:0%
instance right and um we'll have those
 
05:29:59.430 --> 05:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
folks go through a formal evaluation and
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's theum similar to like a 175 point
 
05:30:04.150 --> 05:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
inspection it's safety oriented right
 
05:30:06.110 --> 05:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
but we're also looking hey is this car
 
05:30:08.670 --> 05:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
you know from a professional opinion we
 
05:30:11.150 --> 05:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
want to get the maximum efficacy out of
 
05:30:13.990 --> 05:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
this car ideally two to three years and
 
05:30:15.750 --> 05:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know your question earlier spoke it
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
right it's used cars some occasionally
 
05:30:19.990 --> 05:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lemon but good news garage is
 
05:30:22.590 --> 05:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
always you know um good for that
 
05:30:24.390 --> 05:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
partnership and and so there's always a
 
05:30:26.190 --> 05:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
solution there but we basically evaluate
 
05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
the car um frame and rust work is
 
05:30:30.830 --> 05:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
usually the problem that will get most
 
05:30:32.830 --> 05:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
donations you know if if the frame's
 
05:30:34.510 --> 05:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
rusty it's not worth putting any money
 
05:30:37.390 --> 05:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
into um and then we will fix this car up
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
and award it to a client um and warranty
 
05:30:43.110 --> 05:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
it uh for whatever the period
 
05:30:47.990 --> 05:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
is follow up thank you um that was very
 
05:30:51.628 --> 05:30:51.638 align:start position:0%
and I just am wondering if you get a car
 
05:30:54.830 --> 05:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's um like a rejectable like you
 
05:30:58.070 --> 05:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pursue fixing it what do you
 
05:31:01.030 --> 05:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
guys do with it do you junk them all and
 
05:31:03.070 --> 05:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
have them crushed or do you try to
 
05:31:06.310 --> 05:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
resell them first no we resell we we are
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
um we sell at auction um in Vermont
 
05:31:10.948 --> 05:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
we're actually one of the largest used
 
05:31:12.830 --> 05:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
car dealers due to our selling cars at
 
05:31:15.548 --> 05:31:15.558 align:start position:0%
auction and um what's interesting is
 
05:31:18.390 --> 05:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
that Vermont has a lot of rust right and
 
05:31:20.270 --> 05:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
so we and it has a very high inspection
 
05:31:21.750 --> 05:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
standard so the amount of cars that we
 
05:31:24.548 --> 05:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
can award to um recipients is limited
 
05:31:26.548 --> 05:31:26.558 align:start position:0%
and so we auction off the stuff that we
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
can't and um folks will bring that to
 
05:31:31.510 --> 05:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
places where you know they can get away
 
05:31:33.788 --> 05:31:33.798 align:start position:0%
with getting the car on the
 
05:31:36.948 --> 05:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
road I'm representative Seth King thank
 
05:31:38.350 --> 05:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
you chairman thank you for taking
 
05:31:40.350 --> 05:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
questions today uh it sounds like you
 
05:31:42.548 --> 05:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
get a lot of cars donated and then it
 
05:31:43.628 --> 05:31:43.638 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're also getting some
 
05:31:47.310 --> 05:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
money from cars that you auction off um
 
05:31:49.990 --> 05:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
how else do you get your funding are you
 
05:31:51.750 --> 05:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
getting people that write checks to you
 
05:31:57.030 --> 05:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
as donations and how much if any of your
 
05:31:59.788 --> 05:31:59.798 align:start position:0%
uh of your income comes from state or
 
05:32:02.350 --> 05:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
federal agencies thank you um so good
 
05:32:05.590 --> 05:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
news garage uh operates primarily on
 
05:32:07.390 --> 05:32:07.400 align:start position:0%
with income through state and federal
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
agencies right um we do have auction
 
05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue um and because occasionally
 
05:32:13.548 --> 05:32:13.558 align:start position:0%
right so the way the programs have been
 
05:32:16.230 --> 05:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
designed we occasionally lose money on
 
05:32:18.548 --> 05:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
the programs but we offset that with
 
05:32:21.750 --> 05:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
auction Revenue we have a very small
 
05:32:24.590 --> 05:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
amount of folks who give cash donations
 
05:32:26.190 --> 05:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
but it's not insignificant right I'd
 
05:32:28.190 --> 05:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
have to look I think it's 75 to 90
 
05:32:31.470 --> 05:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
people across New England um um we our
 
05:32:34.110 --> 05:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
donor um base is primarily folks who
 
05:32:35.590 --> 05:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
donate a car they come back a couple
 
05:32:37.070 --> 05:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
years later their kids off to school
 
05:32:38.708 --> 05:32:38.718 align:start position:0%
they got a yard they want to donate
 
05:32:40.150 --> 05:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
another car you know and that's what we
 
05:32:43.150 --> 05:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
cultivate but we do have some folks um
 
05:32:45.548 --> 05:32:45.558 align:start position:0%
of higher capacity who have seen the the
 
05:32:47.150 --> 05:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
impact that we have and support good
 
05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
news garage through philanthropy as well
 
05:32:53.510 --> 05:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you for that answer um
 
05:32:55.510 --> 05:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
you said that you currently are getting
 
05:32:56.910 --> 05:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
the majority of your income through
 
05:32:59.670 --> 05:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
state and federal agencies can you um go
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
into detail a little bit more about that
 
05:33:05.350 --> 05:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
um for example New Hampshire um aside
 
05:33:07.030 --> 05:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
from this program which isn't enacted
 
05:33:09.430 --> 05:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
yet what um what programs are you
 
05:33:10.628 --> 05:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
currently involved with with the state
 
05:33:12.430 --> 05:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so good news garage is
 
05:33:14.470 --> 05:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
not in involved with any programs the
 
05:33:15.430 --> 05:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire right now and
 
05:33:16.990 --> 05:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here today we've for a
 
05:33:19.628 --> 05:33:19.638 align:start position:0%
couple years wanted to be um the
 
05:33:21.910 --> 05:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
challenge is the scarcity of donations
 
05:33:24.150 --> 05:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
right um since covid and since the Ed
 
05:33:27.150 --> 05:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
car market has exploded we've had to
 
05:33:29.110 --> 05:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
work really creatively to continue to
 
05:33:31.310 --> 05:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
get viable donations that we can award
 
05:33:33.470 --> 05:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
and give to people safely that remains a
 
05:33:35.750 --> 05:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
challenge part of when representative
 
05:33:38.110 --> 05:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
Shapiro was reaching out to us we said
 
05:33:39.430 --> 05:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
we want to be realistic about that
 
05:33:41.310 --> 05:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
challenge we said we can't deliver 100
 
05:33:43.110 --> 05:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
cars to New Hampshire Granite Staters
 
05:33:45.230 --> 05:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
right now so we need to start small and
 
05:33:48.070 --> 05:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
as we start small we'd ideally expand
 
05:33:50.350 --> 05:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
our visibility back in the granite state
 
05:33:52.310 --> 05:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
again and through that hopefully gain
 
05:33:53.948 --> 05:33:53.958 align:start position:0%
more donations so that we can award more
 
05:33:55.590 --> 05:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
cars but no we are not active in New
 
05:33:57.270 --> 05:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire despite our historical
 
05:33:59.230 --> 05:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
relationship here and you know like I
 
05:34:00.788 --> 05:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
said I live in Chester that's tough
 
05:34:02.190 --> 05:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
right we want to we want to be helping
 
05:34:04.628 --> 05:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire
 
05:34:06.830 --> 05:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
federally uh no so I I might have
 
05:34:09.030 --> 05:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
misspoke you um we have contracts in the
 
05:34:10.110 --> 05:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts through the
 
05:34:11.830 --> 05:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we have contracts in Vermont through
 
05:34:15.390 --> 05:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
the economic service division which is
 
05:34:17.868 --> 05:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
similar it's a program of you know DHHS
 
05:34:19.750 --> 05:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
there um and those are those are State
 
05:34:21.990 --> 05:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
contracts um every once in a while they
 
05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
have federal dollars and they have to
 
05:34:24.708 --> 05:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
figure that out on their end but it's
 
05:34:26.190 --> 05:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
not it's not for us we have very little
 
05:34:28.590 --> 05:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
federal reporting thank you other
 
05:34:31.510 --> 05:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
questions represent presor Merchant
 
05:34:33.430 --> 05:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:34:34.830 --> 05:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
taking the question this may actually be
 
05:34:36.150 --> 05:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
a question for the Department of Health
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
Human Services but I notice in the audit
 
05:34:42.150 --> 05:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
that they did on the financial
 
05:34:45.030 --> 05:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
compliance it dealt with the issue of
 
05:34:47.190 --> 05:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
the benefit social benefit to both the
 
05:34:49.708 --> 05:34:49.718 align:start position:0%
recipient and Society do you know if any
 
05:34:51.430 --> 05:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
other states have done such an audit
 
05:34:54.270 --> 05:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
with Good Neighbor Garage and looking at
 
05:34:56.948 --> 05:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
recipients of receiving a vehicle in a
 
05:35:00.350 --> 05:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
benefit to them both financi as well as
 
05:35:01.788 --> 05:35:01.798 align:start position:0%
to the state and what the benefit has
 
05:35:03.270 --> 05:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
been as far as trying to reduce the
 
05:35:05.350 --> 05:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
overall benefit cost to the state
 
05:35:07.470 --> 05:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
because they actually have a
 
05:35:09.788 --> 05:35:09.798 align:start position:0%
job uh can I is that was that a question
 
05:35:09.798 --> 05:35:10.510 align:start position:0%
job uh can I is that was that a question
for

05:35:10.510 --> 05:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
me if it's for you or for somebody from
 
05:35:14.230 --> 05:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health Human Services
 
05:35:16.750 --> 05:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
I can start and um they can answer you
 
05:35:18.788 --> 05:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
know so we've actually attempted the
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
past two years to do that because the
 
05:35:22.590 --> 05:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
infamous letter you know it's great data
 
05:35:24.110 --> 05:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
and we said okay we need to replicate
 
05:35:25.590 --> 05:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
that so we worked with the University of
 
05:35:28.110 --> 05:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
Vermont and our contract Partners over
 
05:35:29.948 --> 05:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
in Vermont to try to replicate some of
 
05:35:33.030 --> 05:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
this data um the project is somewhat
 
05:35:36.150 --> 05:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
stalemated uh for various reasons um
 
05:35:38.270 --> 05:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
different priorities uh but we are
 
05:35:40.510 --> 05:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of look at that in
 
05:35:42.230 --> 05:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont specifically Massachusetts has
 
05:35:44.150 --> 05:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
been harder there's a lot more hippo
 
05:35:46.350 --> 05:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
compliance around the client base that
 
05:35:48.190 --> 05:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
we have um and so being able to access
 
05:35:50.270 --> 05:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
the data has been harder we are trying
 
05:35:51.948 --> 05:35:51.958 align:start position:0%
to access that data and ver Ma and have
 
05:35:53.470 --> 05:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
look backs you know internally at good
 
05:35:55.350 --> 05:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
news garage we do look that we have
 
05:35:57.708 --> 05:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
outcome surveys and it's another kind of
 
05:35:59.390 --> 05:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
guard rail to keep folks invested in the
 
05:36:01.030 --> 05:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
program so we check in with them every
 
05:36:04.230 --> 05:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
three six months year um postcard give
 
05:36:05.830 --> 05:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
and say how are you where you at are you
 
05:36:05.840 --> 05:36:06.628 align:start position:0%
and say how are you where you at are you
off

05:36:06.628 --> 05:36:06.638 align:start position:0%
off
 
05:36:09.390 --> 05:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
benefits um that's self-reporting right
 
05:36:11.590 --> 05:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's not crosscorrelation of
 
05:36:14.150 --> 05:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
the data with the Departments and we are
 
05:36:15.548 --> 05:36:15.558 align:start position:0%
working on that in Vermont but I don't
 
05:36:20.470 --> 05:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
have actionable data yet thank you other
 
05:36:22.628 --> 05:36:22.638 align:start position:0%
questions say no other question oh
 
05:36:25.430 --> 05:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative Shapero well actually
 
05:36:27.510 --> 05:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry you can't testify you you
 
05:36:29.990 --> 05:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
already testified you can't you can't
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
question can I just ask you a question
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
can ask me a question sure um I'm just U
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is not a question um but I really
 
05:36:41.750 --> 05:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm realizing that one area um that
 
05:36:43.990 --> 05:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
people have been asking about has not
 
05:36:46.548 --> 05:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
not been covered so maybe I don't get
 
05:36:49.190 --> 05:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
another opportunity to um comment on
 
05:36:51.628 --> 05:36:51.638 align:start position:0%
that but if I could I would I don't
 
05:36:55.030 --> 05:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
believe you do do you I don't I don't I
 
05:36:57.310 --> 05:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
don't believe the rules allow that you
 
05:37:02.708 --> 05:37:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:05.830 --> 05:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay see no one else with questions uh
 
05:37:08.590 --> 05:37:08.600 align:start position:0%

also provided in the written
 
05:42:20.468 --> 05:42:20.478 align:start position:0%
testimony I just want to mention that a
 
05:42:22.990 --> 05:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
similar bill was proposed in
 
05:42:25.628 --> 05:42:25.638 align:start position:0%
2018 and at that time the department
 
05:42:28.708 --> 05:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
worked closely with the EPA to secure
 
05:42:31.788 --> 05:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
the deployment of epa's Last radet
 
05:42:34.230 --> 05:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
Station it's the one located in
 
05:42:36.788 --> 05:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth uh no additional monitoring
 
05:42:40.670 --> 05:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:43.110 --> 05:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
EPA great thank you uh I'm going to
 
05:42:44.868 --> 05:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
comment on section four of the bill um
 
05:42:46.590 --> 05:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
also in the legislation uh the
 
05:42:48.190 --> 05:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
legislation proposes to allow the
 
05:42:50.270 --> 05:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
department to allocate State emergency
 
05:42:52.990 --> 05:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
planning funds to assess air pollutants
 
05:42:55.430 --> 05:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh for the intended purposes of uh
 
05:42:58.390 --> 05:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
assessments uh to detect any possible
 
05:43:01.110 --> 05:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
elevated rate of pediatric rabdom
 
05:43:04.150 --> 05:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
myosarcoma pleuropulmonary blastoma and
 
05:43:06.670 --> 05:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
brain cancer which are pediatric cancers
 
05:43:08.590 --> 05:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
in an area extending 10 miles from
 
05:43:11.310 --> 05:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
Seabrook station nuclear facility the
 
05:43:12.628 --> 05:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
department assumes the attend of the
 
05:43:14.590 --> 05:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
legislation uh maybe for the Department
 
05:43:15.990 --> 05:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
to conduct a cancer concern
 
05:43:17.750 --> 05:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
investigation following the Department's
 
05:43:19.910 --> 05:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
protocol if warranted in order to
 
05:43:21.310 --> 05:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
complete this work the department may
 
05:43:23.310 --> 05:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
need a uh environmental health
 
05:43:25.788 --> 05:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
epidemiology position but again we're
 
05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
unclear on the intent given the
 
05:43:32.390 --> 05:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
language thank you representative
 
05:43:34.990 --> 05:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
warber thank you Mr chair and I seem to
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
have lost all control over my paper work
 
05:43:40.150 --> 05:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
but was the written testimony handed
 
05:43:42.510 --> 05:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
out uh the testimony was submitted
 
05:43:45.070 --> 05:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
submitted electronically oh okay thank
 
05:43:46.830 --> 05:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
you I'll look for it there
 
05:43:49.150 --> 05:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
representative notam thank you for
 
05:43:51.390 --> 05:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you said you test
 
05:43:55.070 --> 05:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
800 samples what's the time per year per
 
05:43:58.430 --> 05:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
month not per day uh that that varies
 
05:44:01.390 --> 05:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
depending on type of samples so uh the
 
05:44:04.468 --> 05:44:04.478 align:start position:0%
thermoluminescent doers the TLD samples
 
05:44:07.468 --> 05:44:07.478 align:start position:0%
are collected quarterly okay uh there
 
05:44:09.310 --> 05:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
are samples that are collected and
 
05:44:12.190 --> 05:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
analyzed weekly and monthly as well I I
 
05:44:13.310 --> 05:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want me to go into
 
05:44:16.190 --> 05:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
detail I'd have to pull no but there
 
05:44:18.310 --> 05:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
there's I just wanted a a vague idea
 
05:44:20.030 --> 05:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking the question thank
 
05:44:23.948 --> 05:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
you representative kosman thank you Mr
 
05:44:27.708 --> 05:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
chairman are is the department aware of
 
05:44:30.910 --> 05:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit C10 research and Education
 
05:44:32.830 --> 05:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
Foundation that conducts surveillance
 
05:44:37.628 --> 05:44:37.638 align:start position:0%
within 10 radial miles of the cab Brook
 
05:44:41.030 --> 05:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
plan the department is aware of of C10
 
05:44:43.350 --> 05:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
okay do you see any redundancy here with
 
05:44:44.750 --> 05:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do and what they
 
05:44:50.948 --> 05:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:54.750 --> 05:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh so we C10 does some
 
05:44:57.948 --> 05:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
monitoring um I I personally do not know
 
05:44:59.350 --> 05:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
the extent of which there may be
 
05:45:01.868 --> 05:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
somebody here that could speak uh to
 
05:45:03.628 --> 05:45:03.638 align:start position:0%
that uh so again I don't have the
 
05:45:06.310 --> 05:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
information on that sorry and and and I
 
05:45:08.150 --> 05:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
think I just add that the the the
 
05:45:10.468 --> 05:45:10.478 align:start position:0%
monitoring program that the the
 
05:45:13.750 --> 05:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
department conducts is again described
 
05:45:16.350 --> 05:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
in RSA uh for our
 
05:45:21.830 --> 05:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:24.468 --> 05:45:24.478 align:start position:0%
plan okay other questions representative
 
05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
Nagel you look like a no okay any other
 
05:45:28.400 --> 05:45:30.070 align:start position:0%
Nagel you look like a no okay any other
questions

05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:45:36.150 --> 05:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:55.708 --> 05:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:58.910 --> 05:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
Abramson good afternoon uh my name is
 
05:46:01.270 --> 05:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
Sarah Abramson and I am a resident of
 
05:46:03.350 --> 05:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
stratum New Hampshire and I'm also
 
05:46:05.590 --> 05:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
executive director of C10 research and
 
05:46:07.310 --> 05:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
Education Foundation so I might be able
 
05:46:09.510 --> 05:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
to answer some of your questions um I
 
05:46:11.670 --> 05:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
did submit my testimony in writing as
 
05:46:13.948 --> 05:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
well um there are some visual Graphics
 
05:46:15.788 --> 05:46:15.798 align:start position:0%
at the end that could be
 
05:46:18.190 --> 05:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
helpful um I want to start off by saying
 
05:46:20.468 --> 05:46:20.478 align:start position:0%
that my purview and expertise is really
 
05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
in radiological monitoring of the air uh
 
05:46:25.788 --> 05:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is a little broad as I read it
 
05:46:28.270 --> 05:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
to include liquid and solid forms as
 
05:46:30.270 --> 05:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
well um and I'm referring just to
 
05:46:33.310 --> 05:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
section one uh for what my testimony is
 
05:46:33.320 --> 05:46:37.430 align:start position:0%
section one uh for what my testimony is
relevant

05:46:37.430 --> 05:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:40.590 --> 05:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
to uh C10 stands for Citizens within the
 
05:46:43.390 --> 05:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
10 mile radius of the Seabrook uh
 
05:46:45.430 --> 05:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
nuclear power plant which is the
 
05:46:47.548 --> 05:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
evacuation pathway emergency planning
 
05:46:49.948 --> 05:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
zone of that plant um I'm here today in
 
05:46:51.430 --> 05:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
a professional capacity and also a
 
05:46:54.670 --> 05:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
personal one I live inside the sebr epz
 
05:46:56.270 --> 05:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh with my husband my four-year-old son
 
05:46:58.868 --> 05:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
and my kitten I have an educational back
 
05:47:00.350 --> 05:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
ground in environmental science and
 
05:47:01.628 --> 05:47:01.638 align:start position:0%
policy and I have an intimate
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
familiarity with real-time radiological
 
05:47:06.788 --> 05:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the air uh because C10 has
 
05:47:08.468 --> 05:47:08.478 align:start position:0%
provided this service under contract
 
05:47:10.110 --> 05:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
with the state of Massachusetts for over
 
05:47:10.120 --> 05:47:11.190 align:start position:0%
with the state of Massachusetts for over
30

05:47:11.190 --> 05:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
30
 
05:47:13.628 --> 05:47:13.638 align:start position:0%
years um I'd like to start by sharing a
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
story of particular relevance to this
 
05:47:17.590 --> 05:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
proposed bill you all may recall on July
 
05:47:20.070 --> 05:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
12 2022 an evacuation alarm was
 
05:47:21.510 --> 05:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
inadvertently triggered at C Brook
 
05:47:23.750 --> 05:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
station and that set off an evacuation
 
05:47:25.788 --> 05:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
alert across all of New Hampshire's
 
05:47:28.070 --> 05:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
beaches uh given that it was a hot day
 
05:47:29.510 --> 05:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
there were thousands of peoples on the
 
05:47:31.310 --> 05:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
beach and when the alarm was sounded
 
05:47:33.030 --> 05:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
many people scrambled to their cars to
 
05:47:35.110 --> 05:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
turn on the radio instructed by the
 
05:47:37.430 --> 05:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
siren's message to do so um but of
 
05:47:38.750 --> 05:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
course nobody was talking about an
 
05:47:41.430 --> 05:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
emergency because there wasn't one it
 
05:47:43.670 --> 05:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
took almost one hour for CBR station its
 
05:47:45.628 --> 05:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
owner's next era to craft and deliver a
 
05:47:46.868 --> 05:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
public message that there was no
 
05:47:49.030 --> 05:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
emergency uh my cell phone the cell
 
05:47:50.788 --> 05:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
phones of many of my board members uh
 
05:47:52.670 --> 05:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
were ringing off the hook with some
 
05:47:54.430 --> 05:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
frantic people if I'm being honest like
 
05:47:56.670 --> 05:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
crying mothers wondering if they should
 
05:47:58.948 --> 05:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
get their kids in the car and evacuate
 
05:48:00.788 --> 05:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
um and all of that frankly could have
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
been prevented by better communication
 
05:48:05.510 --> 05:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
um but also by readily available
 
05:48:08.390 --> 05:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
radiation information at the state level
 
05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
or at least a public portal that um
 
05:48:12.590 --> 05:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
citizens could access on their own to to
 
05:48:15.990 --> 05:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
get that peace of mind um the skepticism
 
05:48:17.910 --> 05:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
from the public um not just that day but
 
05:48:19.788 --> 05:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
also the days that followed is born from
 
05:48:22.110 --> 05:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
that the lack of uh real-time radiation
 
05:48:25.910 --> 05:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring from somebody independent of
 
05:48:27.750 --> 05:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
the corporation that runs the nuclear
 
05:48:30.548 --> 05:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
plant um the ability for the State of
 
05:48:32.070 --> 05:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be empowered with that
 
05:48:34.510 --> 05:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
information um can also enable it to
 
05:48:36.868 --> 05:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
decisively take action without having to
 
05:48:38.628 --> 05:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
wait for somebody else some outside
 
05:48:40.110 --> 05:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
party to provide them with this
 
05:48:42.270 --> 05:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
information um not just in a real
 
05:48:44.070 --> 05:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
emergency but as we saw in a false
 
05:48:45.910 --> 05:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
emergency it can be a public safety
 
05:48:48.788 --> 05:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
issue to have people uh reacting to a
 
05:48:48.798 --> 05:48:50.868 align:start position:0%
issue to have people uh reacting to a
false

05:48:50.868 --> 05:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
false
 
05:48:52.830 --> 05:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
emergency um within minutes of the
 
05:48:54.788 --> 05:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
activation C10 spoke directly with the
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
NRC resident inspectors uh we
 
05:48:58.948 --> 05:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
communicate often and they verified it
 
05:49:00.628 --> 05:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
was a false alarm due to a technician
 
05:49:02.230 --> 05:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
error and we immediately shared that
 
05:49:04.270 --> 05:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
information with our Massachusetts
 
05:49:06.310 --> 05:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Massachusetts
 
05:49:08.590 --> 05:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management agency
 
05:49:11.468 --> 05:49:11.478 align:start position:0%
partners um we also were able to confirm
 
05:49:13.628 --> 05:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
with them as an independent body that we
 
05:49:15.510 --> 05:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
weren't seeing any radiological releases
 
05:49:17.110 --> 05:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
that indicated anything abnormal was
 
05:49:18.990 --> 05:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
happening and we continued to provide
 
05:49:20.548 --> 05:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
that as a public statement both on the
 
05:49:22.350 --> 05:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
news and on our website and to the state
 
05:49:24.310 --> 05:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts in the days that
 
05:49:27.310 --> 05:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
followed um another relevant story of a
 
05:49:29.110 --> 05:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
is the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima
 
05:49:32.510 --> 05:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
daichi reactor in Japan in 2011 I'm not
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
making any comparisons between CBR
 
05:49:35.990 --> 05:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
station and that reactor but I simply
 
05:49:37.948 --> 05:49:37.958 align:start position:0%
want to point to the many
 
05:49:40.468 --> 05:49:40.478 align:start position:0%
reports um in the years that followed
 
05:49:43.070 --> 05:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
highlighting how the government um a and
 
05:49:44.910 --> 05:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
emergency response Personnel were unable
 
05:49:47.270 --> 05:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
to communicate effectively with the
 
05:49:48.628 --> 05:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
people that were at the plant because
 
05:49:50.468 --> 05:49:50.478 align:start position:0%
the earthquake and tsunami that caused
 
05:49:52.310 --> 05:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
that disaster brought down a lot of
 
05:49:54.510 --> 05:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
communications infrastructure so
 
05:49:56.830 --> 05:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
traditional phone and internet and
 
05:49:58.830 --> 05:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
power uh without that critical
 
05:50:01.868 --> 05:50:01.878 align:start position:0%
connection uh the plant couldn't receive
 
05:50:03.190 --> 05:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
instruction from decision makers
 
05:50:04.910 --> 05:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
decision makers couldn't receive
 
05:50:06.910 --> 05:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
insights um on the severity of any
 
05:50:09.548 --> 05:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
radiological releases um and another
 
05:50:11.230 --> 05:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunate Discovery was that officials
 
05:50:13.468 --> 05:50:13.478 align:start position:0%
inadvertently evacuated citizens into
 
05:50:16.510 --> 05:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
high levels of radiation where wind had
 
05:50:19.150 --> 05:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
pushed some of the plume um and
 
05:50:20.788 --> 05:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
something that could have been prevented
 
05:50:23.230 --> 05:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
had they had a network of realtime
 
05:50:23.240 --> 05:50:24.830 align:start position:0%
had they had a network of realtime
radiological

05:50:24.830 --> 05:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
radiological
 
05:50:27.070 --> 05:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
monitors so for the last 30 years the
 
05:50:28.910 --> 05:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts has contracted
 
05:50:31.430 --> 05:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
with C10 to provide independent realtime
 
05:50:33.830 --> 05:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
radiation monitoring uh the data is
 
05:50:36.070 --> 05:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
accessible to State officials
 
05:50:39.150 --> 05:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
247365 providing unfettered um access to
 
05:50:41.110 --> 05:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
keep Public Safety information and that
 
05:50:44.590 --> 05:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
is through a secure private portal um if
 
05:50:46.310 --> 05:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
public uh if members of the public do
 
05:50:47.670 --> 05:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
want information they can submit a
 
05:50:49.150 --> 05:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
public records
 
05:50:51.270 --> 05:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
request um we're able to provide the
 
05:50:52.708 --> 05:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
service to the state of Massachusetts
 
05:50:55.070 --> 05:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
currently at a rate of $100,000 per year
 
05:50:58.468 --> 05:50:58.478 align:start position:0%
for 13 monitoring sites we measure both
 
05:51:01.390 --> 05:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
beta and gamma radiation again just the
 
05:51:05.830 --> 05:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:07.830 --> 05:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
direction um Massachusetts state
 
05:51:09.670 --> 05:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
officials dictate their desired alert
 
05:51:11.868 --> 05:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
level meaning if C10 probes detect
 
05:51:14.468 --> 05:51:14.478 align:start position:0%
radiation levels at or above that alert
 
05:51:16.468 --> 05:51:16.478 align:start position:0%
level for a consecutive two minutes then
 
05:51:18.670 --> 05:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
our system sends an automatic email and
 
05:51:21.230 --> 05:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
text alert to key Department of Health
 
05:51:23.590 --> 05:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
and Mima
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
officials representative Weber oh
 
05:51:27.360 --> 05:51:30.030 align:start position:0%
officials representative Weber oh
sure

05:51:30.030 --> 05:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:51:31.948 --> 05:51:31.958 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of the hour and the time and
 
05:51:33.628 --> 05:51:33.638 align:start position:0%
I'm also aware that I can read this
 
05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
faster than you can speak it okay um and
 
05:51:40.750 --> 05:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
I wonder if um perhaps a summary could
 
05:51:44.230 --> 05:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
be asked for but I also wonder if uh the
 
05:51:46.868 --> 05:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
person testimony testifying can be can
 
05:51:50.030 --> 05:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
tell us what they think about the bill
 
05:51:52.628 --> 05:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
and the provisions in the bill rather
 
05:51:54.990 --> 05:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
than the background which we can all
 
05:51:57.990 --> 05:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
read for ourselves sure we are we are I
 
05:52:00.310 --> 05:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
think pretty much winding down on the
 
05:52:02.270 --> 05:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
time limit anyway so yeah I can respect
 
05:52:05.070 --> 05:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
that so goad so I'm actually was
 
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
impressed by the good car's garage sort
 
05:52:09.310 --> 05:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
of um presentation it made me think you
 
05:52:10.750 --> 05:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
know the relationship we have with the
 
05:52:12.990 --> 05:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts is a service
 
05:52:14.910 --> 05:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
contract type relationship when I looked
 
05:52:16.750 --> 05:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
at this bill what stood out to me was
 
05:52:18.948 --> 05:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
over $2 million in funding in a
 
05:52:20.708 --> 05:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
three-year period to build a brand new
 
05:52:23.350 --> 05:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
network from the ground up um I'm having
 
05:52:24.868 --> 05:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
trouble wrapping my head around that as
 
05:52:27.430 --> 05:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who leads an organization um
 
05:52:30.830 --> 05:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's able to run 13 probes off
 
05:52:33.270 --> 05:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um so I think that I would
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee and the sponsors
 
05:52:36.788 --> 05:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
of this bill to to maybe work more with
 
05:52:38.230 --> 05:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
the department or kind of see where some
 
05:52:39.910 --> 05:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
of those numbers are coming from because
 
05:52:41.190 --> 05:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
at that price point I mean I think it
 
05:52:44.270 --> 05:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
would be dead on arrival um so I I just
 
05:52:46.510 --> 05:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to put that's my personal thought
 
05:52:49.430 --> 05:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and also that under section one uh
 
05:52:50.948 --> 05:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
radiological monitoring of their is
 
05:52:52.548 --> 05:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical for many reasons
 
05:52:55.990 --> 05:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
outlined in here um in particular if
 
05:52:58.590 --> 05:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
there was a severe weather emergency and
 
05:53:00.190 --> 05:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
the NRC has stated very clearly that
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
that is the most likely event to push
 
05:53:03.708 --> 05:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
CBR station into an emergency and that's
 
05:53:05.430 --> 05:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
when you can expect traditional
 
05:53:08.430 --> 05:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure like phone and power um
 
05:53:09.548 --> 05:53:09.558 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:53:09.558 --> 05:53:11.350 align:start position:0%
to be
unavailable

05:53:11.350 --> 05:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
unavailable
 
05:53:14.350 --> 05:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative Merchant has a
 
05:53:17.230 --> 05:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:53:18.390 --> 05:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking a question try to make
 
05:53:21.788 --> 05:53:21.798 align:start position:0%
this brief in looking over the issue of
 
05:53:21.798 --> 05:53:24.070 align:start position:0%
this brief in looking over the issue of
false

05:53:24.070 --> 05:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
false
 
05:53:27.590 --> 05:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
alarms logic sort of explains to me that
 
05:53:30.468 --> 05:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
if you put more devices out into I
 
05:53:32.510 --> 05:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
believe in monitoring don't get me wrong
 
05:53:35.070 --> 05:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm also looking at the ability to
 
05:53:37.868 --> 05:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
trigger more false alarms so how do you
 
05:53:40.110 --> 05:53:40.120 align:start position:0%
balance then between having the ability
 
05:53:43.110 --> 05:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
to monitor the environment for activity
 
05:53:44.910 --> 05:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
but minimize the false alarms which
 
05:53:47.350 --> 05:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
causes panic in a lot of
 
05:53:49.750 --> 05:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
people that's a great question um and
 
05:53:51.910 --> 05:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
I'll maybe clarify you know the false
 
05:53:54.468 --> 05:53:54.478 align:start position:0%
alarm at CBR a CBR technician
 
05:53:56.270 --> 05:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
accidentally flipped a button that had
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
the ability to set off sirens C10
 
05:54:00.670 --> 05:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
Network or any network that DHHS or
 
05:54:02.670 --> 05:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else might want to build to
 
05:54:04.830 --> 05:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
provide uh radiological monitoring
 
05:54:07.430 --> 05:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
creates alerts that that you can just
 
05:54:09.628 --> 05:54:09.638 align:start position:0%
choose the exact people to whom those
 
05:54:12.070 --> 05:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
alerts go um so when an alert level is
 
05:54:14.350 --> 05:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
reached in artware network it only
 
05:54:17.430 --> 05:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
alerts about four individual people
 
05:54:20.948 --> 05:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
there is no public facing
 
05:54:25.670 --> 05:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
alert so there's a nuclear plume there's
 
05:54:27.150 --> 05:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
four people who know about it but the
 
05:54:28.948 --> 05:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
rest of us don't
 
05:54:31.390 --> 05:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
there is a unified command structure um
 
05:54:32.990 --> 05:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire in
 
05:54:34.708 --> 05:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that dictates really
 
05:54:37.750 --> 05:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
carefully how uh certain agencies would
 
05:54:39.670 --> 05:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
interact with other groups to react in
 
05:54:41.110 --> 05:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
an emergency I won't speak to that
 
05:54:45.628 --> 05:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
that's more of uh HSM and uh maybe DHHS
 
05:54:45.638 --> 05:54:46.750 align:start position:0%
that's more of uh HSM and uh maybe DHHS
as

05:54:46.750 --> 05:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:54:49.708 --> 05:54:49.718 align:start position:0%
well representative Weber you had
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
a okay anything anyone else any other
 
05:54:56.590 --> 05:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
05:54:59.270 --> 05:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
you no one else has signed up to testify
 
05:55:00.788 --> 05:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
on hb1
 
05:55:03.548 --> 05:55:03.558 align:start position:0%
1612 so I am going to close the public
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill I'm I'm
 
05:55:07.920 --> 05:55:11.670 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill I'm I'm
sorry

05:55:11.670 --> 05:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:14.110 --> 05:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
oh is that
 
05:55:17.590 --> 05:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
1612 I'm sorry I I didn't have it okay
 
05:55:22.230 --> 05:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry apologize uh Bruce berky uh
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
from next era energy is U signed up to
 
05:55:30.468 --> 05:55:30.478 align:start position:0%
speak sorry Mr
 
05:55:33.310 --> 05:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
berky thank you Mr chairman and and U
 
05:55:35.350 --> 05:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
given the hour I'll try to be very brief
 
05:55:37.190 --> 05:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
this afternoon for your record my name
 
05:55:39.948 --> 05:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
is Bruce berky I represent I'm I'm with
 
05:55:42.430 --> 05:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
shenin capital group here in town we
 
05:55:45.670 --> 05:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
represent next era energy exter energy
 
05:55:48.510 --> 05:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
is the majority owner of Seabrook
 
05:55:52.150 --> 05:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
station approximately 90% and the other
 
05:55:56.070 --> 05:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
10% are uh owned um mostly by
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the Commonwealth
 
05:56:01.350 --> 05:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um just wanted to share a
 
05:56:04.510 --> 05:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
few thoughts Mr baronelli mentioned uh
 
05:56:07.430 --> 05:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
that this legislation had been before
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
this body before and it has three
 
05:56:14.948 --> 05:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
different times 2018 2019 2020 and in
 
05:56:19.070 --> 05:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
all three cases it was deemed uh either
 
05:56:21.310 --> 05:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate or sent to inim
 
05:56:24.948 --> 05:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
study and and as being unnecessary and
 
05:56:27.868 --> 05:56:27.878 align:start position:0%
the bill really isn't necessary because
 
05:56:30.350 --> 05:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
of the testing and the uh radiation
 
05:56:32.628 --> 05:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
monitoring that is taking place at the
 
05:56:37.270 --> 05:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
station and also uh through hhs's Uh
 
05:56:40.590 --> 05:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
current work and and Portsmouth and
 
05:56:45.628 --> 05:56:45.638 align:start position:0%
conquered um there are uh 80 sites
 
05:56:49.110 --> 05:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
within the confines of CBR station where
 
05:56:52.350 --> 05:56:52.360 align:start position:0%
they have radiation monitoring uh
 
05:56:56.230 --> 05:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
devices and the the feeling is that this
 
05:56:59.590 --> 05:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
bill would be redundant
 
05:57:03.110 --> 05:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
would add costs with no
 
05:57:07.708 --> 05:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
benefit and that the um the system
 
05:57:09.670 --> 05:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's in place at seabook station right
 
05:57:14.548 --> 05:57:14.558 align:start position:0%
now is professional and 24 hours a day
 
05:57:18.270 --> 05:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
365 although this year will be 366 days
 
05:57:18.280 --> 05:57:19.190 align:start position:0%
365 although this year will be 366 days
a

05:57:19.190 --> 05:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:57:23.030 --> 05:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
year um they have been conducting this
 
05:57:25.350 --> 05:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
work since
 
05:57:27.788 --> 05:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
1982 as you may know the plant went on
 
05:57:29.030 --> 05:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
online in
 
05:57:31.708 --> 05:57:31.718 align:start position:0%
1990 and so they started this work in
 
05:57:35.270 --> 05:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
1982 to create that Baseline prior to
 
05:57:37.548 --> 05:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
cab Brook station going online so that
 
05:57:41.868 --> 05:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
there would be a good um basis of work
 
05:57:41.878 --> 05:57:44.190 align:start position:0%
there would be a good um basis of work
for

05:57:44.190 --> 05:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:57:46.830 --> 05:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
comparison um it is a top priority of
 
05:57:48.948 --> 05:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
Cook Station there's never been a
 
05:57:51.230 --> 05:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
radiological incident associated with
 
05:57:51.240 --> 05:57:52.670 align:start position:0%
radiological incident associated with
cook

05:57:52.670 --> 05:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
cook
 
05:57:55.590 --> 05:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
operations um it continuously feeds
 
05:57:57.910 --> 05:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
information to the facilities control
 
05:58:01.708 --> 05:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
room at the site and it is reviewed by
 
05:58:03.548 --> 05:58:03.558 align:start position:0%
at least four operators that are
 
05:58:06.990 --> 05:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
licensed by the nuclear Regulatory
 
05:58:09.190 --> 05:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
Commission it's more extensive than
 
05:58:10.708 --> 05:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
required by the
 
05:58:14.750 --> 05:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
NRC and the 100 monitoring locations
 
05:58:18.230 --> 05:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
because they have S sites outside of the
 
05:58:21.750 --> 05:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
the uh property at seawork station um
 
05:58:23.788 --> 05:58:23.798 align:start position:0%
provides a wide sampling of
 
05:58:27.270 --> 05:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
sources and it's designed to detect any
 
05:58:29.390 --> 05:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
radiation that could accumulate over a
 
05:58:31.468 --> 05:58:31.478 align:start position:0%
period of time and that's required by
 
05:58:31.478 --> 05:58:32.628 align:start position:0%
period of time and that's required by
federal

05:58:32.628 --> 05:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:58:35.910 --> 05:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
law so I would ask this committee that
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
if it if this bill um does not go
 
05:58:42.628 --> 05:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
forward that would be terrific if the if
 
05:58:44.670 --> 05:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
there's some concern about this bill and
 
05:58:47.390 --> 05:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
want further information uh Mr Dave
 
05:58:49.750 --> 05:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
Robinson from seabook station who is the
 
05:58:52.548 --> 05:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
chemistry lab manager there couldn't be
 
05:58:56.190 --> 05:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
here today thus you have me um but he
 
05:58:58.110 --> 05:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
could make himself available for any
 
05:58:59.910 --> 05:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work if the committee moved
 
05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
in that direction thank you that I'll
 
05:59:04.310 --> 05:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
conclude my remarks thank you any
 
05:59:06.830 --> 05:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
05:59:12.510 --> 05:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:14.948 --> 05:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm going to try again I'm
 
05:59:18.190 --> 05:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on hb1
 
05:59:21.430 --> 05:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
1612 and open the public hearing on hb1
 
05:59:25.830 --> 05:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
1662 FN and recognize the prime sponsor
 
05:59:41.430 --> 05:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:43.590 --> 05:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman good afternoon
 
05:59:46.190 --> 05:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
for the record representative H I'm
 
05:59:47.750 --> 05:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
serving the towns of Dunbarton hookit
 
05:59:50.030 --> 05:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
Allenstown and Fs I'm here to testify in
 
05:59:54.030 --> 05:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
favor of House Bill 1662
 
05:59:56.948 --> 05:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
dfn so I read the bill then I read the
 
05:59:58.628 --> 05:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I'm not sure how the fiscal
 
06:00:01.510 --> 06:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
note matches the bill but we'll get
 
06:00:03.430 --> 06:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
there this should be a simple
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measure right we have a
 
06:00:10.230 --> 06:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
department DHHS within DHHS relative to
 
06:00:11.868 --> 06:00:11.878 align:start position:0%
the division of children youth and
 
06:00:15.150 --> 06:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
families one of their primary
 
06:00:18.910 --> 06:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is to place children in
 
06:00:22.190 --> 06:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
New PL in new homes foster care or other
 
06:00:25.110 --> 06:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
if they deem that the child is in
 
06:00:28.310 --> 06:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
danger we also have adoption agencies in
 
06:00:31.230 --> 06:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
the state one would think it would be an
 
06:00:32.948 --> 06:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
inherent conflict of interest to have
 
06:00:34.830 --> 06:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
someone who works for an adoption agency
 
06:00:37.110 --> 06:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
who's also tasked with taking children
 
06:00:39.590 --> 06:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
from someone's homes I would think this
 
06:00:42.350 --> 06:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
is a problem that has very few actual
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
real world cases but a Prohibition would
 
06:00:48.390 --> 06:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
make sense in this case because we don't
 
06:00:50.510 --> 06:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
want to have someone incentivized to
 
06:00:52.590 --> 06:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
place children outside who gets paid to
 
06:00:54.430 --> 06:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
place children outside who
 
06:00:57.468 --> 06:00:57.478 align:start position:0%
simultaneously is responsible for
 
06:00:59.670 --> 06:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
determining whether the CH the child
 
06:01:02.788 --> 06:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
that is is or may be in danger needs to
 
06:01:02.798 --> 06:01:03.670 align:start position:0%
that is is or may be in danger needs to
be

06:01:03.670 --> 06:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:01:05.468 --> 06:01:05.478 align:start position:0%
removed we have all sorts of
 
06:01:06.948 --> 06:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
prohibitions in our statutes about
 
06:01:08.430 --> 06:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
certain things this one seems like a
 
06:01:11.030 --> 06:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
very logical extension in fact it I
 
06:01:12.350 --> 06:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
would call it a housekeeping measure
 
06:01:14.270 --> 06:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
there's no there should be no real harm
 
06:01:16.390 --> 06:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
if there's people opposing this bill I
 
06:01:19.070 --> 06:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
would be concerned right about this now
 
06:01:20.670 --> 06:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
if I read the fiscal note I don't know
 
06:01:24.270 --> 06:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
what happened um cuz the depart this is
 
06:01:25.948 --> 06:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
line three in the methodology the
 
06:01:27.628 --> 06:01:27.638 align:start position:0%
department states that the lure for
 
06:01:30.788 --> 06:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
these entities falls under RSA 170e so
 
06:01:33.190 --> 06:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
they somehow tie in the entire Foster
 
06:01:33.200 --> 06:01:34.230 align:start position:0%
they somehow tie in the entire Foster
Care

06:01:34.230 --> 06:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
Care
 
06:01:36.230 --> 06:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
Program this has nothing to do with the
 
06:01:38.230 --> 06:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
Foster Care Program not interested in
 
06:01:40.510 --> 06:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
touching the foster care program this is
 
06:01:42.590 --> 06:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
primarily about someone who works for an
 
06:01:45.190 --> 06:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
adoption agency as spelled out in the
 
06:01:48.270 --> 06:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
text of the bill okay or a child placing
 
06:01:51.230 --> 06:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
agency not a recipient in the Foster
 
06:01:54.468 --> 06:01:54.478 align:start position:0%
Care Program who can't work for the
 
06:01:56.070 --> 06:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
agency that helps take children from
 
06:01:59.468 --> 06:01:59.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:01.628 --> 06:02:01.638 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know whether we go back to
 
06:02:02.708 --> 06:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
the Department and ask for a
 
06:02:04.350 --> 06:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
clarification on the fiscal note because
 
06:02:07.150 --> 06:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note is is not tied to the
 
06:02:08.830 --> 06:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill maybe they misunderstood it I don't
 
06:02:11.910 --> 06:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
know but I do think that having a simple
 
06:02:13.830 --> 06:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
prohibition about if you're tasked with
 
06:02:16.110 --> 06:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
removing children from people's homes
 
06:02:18.270 --> 06:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
then you shouldn't be also paid to place
 
06:02:21.590 --> 06:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
children in other homes um can you
 
06:02:23.708 --> 06:02:23.718 align:start position:0%
volunteer as an adult and and be a
 
06:02:25.708 --> 06:02:25.718 align:start position:0%
foster care recipient and an employee of
 
06:02:28.548 --> 06:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
the state absolutely I I I think Foster
 
06:02:30.910 --> 06:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
cents are are a great attribute or a
 
06:02:33.590 --> 06:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
great resource within our state um think
 
06:02:34.990 --> 06:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
very highly of them they are some of the
 
06:02:36.910 --> 06:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
most qualified families out there so
 
06:02:38.150 --> 06:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
there's no reason I would ever want to
 
06:02:40.030 --> 06:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
see a Prohibition between being a foster
 
06:02:42.030 --> 06:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
care parent and being a state employee
 
06:02:43.350 --> 06:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're talking about what
 
06:02:45.548 --> 06:02:45.558 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is you're being paid
 
06:02:48.548 --> 06:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
to help move a child to a new
 
06:02:51.110 --> 06:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
home as
 
06:02:55.350 --> 06:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
um as a job function not being because
 
06:02:57.350 --> 06:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
you get reimbursed for the expenses of
 
06:02:59.830 --> 06:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
being a foster care parent so maybe the
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
language needs to be tightened a little
 
06:03:03.070 --> 06:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
bit for that I'll gladly work with
 
06:03:04.590 --> 06:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
whoever on the committee wants to pick
 
06:03:06.990 --> 06:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
that up that was not the intent I don't
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
see how we would have gotten there by
 
06:03:10.868 --> 06:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
the Department's interpretation but just
 
06:03:13.310 --> 06:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
in case I want to make sure that the
 
06:03:14.390 --> 06:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
committee understands I'm willing to
 
06:03:15.830 --> 06:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
work on the language if we need to
 
06:03:18.030 --> 06:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
tighten it up it was purely about
 
06:03:20.590 --> 06:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
preventing someone from helping exercise
 
06:03:22.590 --> 06:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
and set up relationships for the purpose
 
06:03:25.590 --> 06:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
of adoption moving children to a new
 
06:03:28.310 --> 06:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
family who's also simultaneously tasked
 
06:03:31.910 --> 06:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
with taking them from a family with that
 
06:03:33.430 --> 06:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'll close my testimony and answer any
 
06:03:37.150 --> 06:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you representative
 
06:03:39.708 --> 06:03:39.718 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you for your testimony thank
 
06:03:41.628 --> 06:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for U
 
06:03:44.390 --> 06:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question so am I right in
 
06:03:45.830 --> 06:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
thinking from what you said that you
 
06:03:48.230 --> 06:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
don't know of any actual case where this
 
06:03:49.548 --> 06:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
has actually
 
06:03:51.708 --> 06:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
happened I would hope that this has
 
06:03:53.948 --> 06:03:53.958 align:start position:0%
never happened that doesn't mean that I
 
06:03:55.548 --> 06:03:55.558 align:start position:0%
know everything so it could have
 
06:03:57.270 --> 06:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
happened I'm this I am personally not
 
06:03:59.230 --> 06:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
aware of any cases so this is not a bill
 
06:04:01.390 --> 06:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
in response to something that I know
 
06:04:03.670 --> 06:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
definitely happened but it did come up
 
06:04:06.468 --> 06:04:06.478 align:start position:0%
in discussions about could it happen and
 
06:04:08.750 --> 06:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
this is a reasonable prohibition to make
 
06:04:10.910 --> 06:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
sure this doesn't happen children are
 
06:04:13.230 --> 06:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
some of the most valuable things right
 
06:04:16.110 --> 06:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
for every parent in this room You' give
 
06:04:18.270 --> 06:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
your life for your child I was
 
06:04:23.750 --> 06:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:28.910 --> 06:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
the thank you other questions
 
06:04:30.548 --> 06:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
06:04:36.350 --> 06:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:38.670 --> 06:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
welcome also signed up to speak as
 
06:04:40.070 --> 06:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
Attorney John Williams with the
 
06:04:49.628 --> 06:04:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:51.948 --> 06:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
Services chairman McDonald members of
 
06:04:53.750 --> 06:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
the committee I started my day and I I
 
06:04:56.510 --> 06:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
will end my day uh before this committee
 
06:04:58.190 --> 06:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh the department doesn't choose which
 
06:05:00.190 --> 06:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
bills that we have to do fiscal analysis
 
06:05:02.190 --> 06:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
on we do receive them from the
 
06:05:03.990 --> 06:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistance office as
 
06:05:06.548 --> 06:05:06.558 align:start position:0%
they come to us and it was really was
 
06:05:09.070 --> 06:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
helpful to listen to the B Bill sponsor
 
06:05:12.070 --> 06:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
represent hle at least describe what his
 
06:05:14.390 --> 06:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
his goals were around it the reason why
 
06:05:16.510 --> 06:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
the department had concerns relative to
 
06:05:18.788 --> 06:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
its application for foster parents is
 
06:05:20.788 --> 06:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
online for the bill you see that it's
 
06:05:24.190 --> 06:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
targeting towards a and a licensed
 
06:05:26.590 --> 06:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
adoption or child placement agency one
 
06:05:28.628 --> 06:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
of the items it we identified as perhaps
 
06:05:30.548 --> 06:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
a technical defect or mechanical defect
 
06:05:31.990 --> 06:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
with the bill and it probably has
 
06:05:34.070 --> 06:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the bill sponsor and
 
06:05:35.788 --> 06:05:35.798 align:start position:0%
the uh Attorneys at the office of
 
06:05:37.350 --> 06:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
legislative services with the number of
 
06:05:38.830 --> 06:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
bills they had to draft this year did
 
06:05:40.830 --> 06:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
the best that they could and they put it
 
06:05:42.548 --> 06:05:42.558 align:start position:0%
into the Department's General Authority
 
06:05:42.558 --> 06:05:43.670 align:start position:0%
into the Department's General Authority
under

06:05:43.670 --> 06:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:05:46.190 --> 06:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
126a these licensing authorities are
 
06:05:49.708 --> 06:05:49.718 align:start position:0%
actually regulated under 173 uh 170e
 
06:05:51.868 --> 06:05:51.878 align:start position:0%
which also includes foster parents
 
06:05:53.230 --> 06:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
that's the logical connection that the
 
06:05:55.030 --> 06:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
department drew that this could have an
 
06:05:57.788 --> 06:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence and didn't know
 
06:05:59.350 --> 06:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not that that's what the bill
 
06:06:01.830 --> 06:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
intended to do uh if the bill sponsor
 
06:06:02.948 --> 06:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
working with this committee and
 
06:06:04.868 --> 06:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
certainly working with the Department uh
 
06:06:06.628 --> 06:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
makes that clear in the legislation and
 
06:06:08.670 --> 06:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh that would be particularly
 
06:06:10.830 --> 06:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
helpful to us because our concern as
 
06:06:13.150 --> 06:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
currently drafted it raises lots of
 
06:06:14.990 --> 06:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
issues and and in fact we would have
 
06:06:17.548 --> 06:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
suggested a review by your house legal
 
06:06:20.430 --> 06:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
councel uh as to the severability uh
 
06:06:22.548 --> 06:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
aspect and constitutionality of such a
 
06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
provision that would prevent um an
 
06:06:27.230 --> 06:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
individual who's employed with DCF by by
 
06:06:29.468 --> 06:06:29.478 align:start position:0%
also serving as a foster parent
 
06:06:30.868 --> 06:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
particularly where those programs are
 
06:06:32.510 --> 06:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
administered by separate entity
 
06:06:34.270 --> 06:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
oversight other than the department so
 
06:06:35.350 --> 06:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
there would not be a conflict of
 
06:06:38.868 --> 06:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
interest there uh I am not a proponent
 
06:06:41.190 --> 06:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
um for bills that are looking for
 
06:06:43.070 --> 06:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
solutions to problems that at least
 
06:06:45.830 --> 06:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
represented to you do not exist uh I was
 
06:06:48.310 --> 06:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
not aware we did go through our staff
 
06:06:50.788 --> 06:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge we couldn't identify
 
06:06:53.350 --> 06:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
any individual who is employed in a
 
06:06:55.110 --> 06:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
child placement agency we did take the
 
06:06:57.670 --> 06:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
extra step to look in a identify that we
 
06:06:59.548 --> 06:06:59.558 align:start position:0%
do have 10 employees that do are
 
06:07:01.190 --> 06:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
involved with foster care but to our
 
06:07:03.830 --> 06:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge there's nobody here that would
 
06:07:05.548 --> 06:07:05.558 align:start position:0%
fall in the category of working for a
 
06:07:08.390 --> 06:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
child placing agency clearly I would
 
06:07:10.030 --> 06:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
think and would have to agree that there
 
06:07:11.788 --> 06:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
would be some level of a conflict of
 
06:07:13.390 --> 06:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
interest and certainly could be looking
 
06:07:15.548 --> 06:07:15.558 align:start position:0%
at that issue but it's not typical that
 
06:07:17.510 --> 06:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature puts forward legislation
 
06:07:19.390 --> 06:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
unless they've actually identified an
 
06:07:20.868 --> 06:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
issue or potential issue and to my
 
06:07:22.750 --> 06:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge over the decades and Decades
 
06:07:24.750 --> 06:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
of uh placing children this this has not
 
06:07:26.390 --> 06:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
been an issue at all but it was helpful
 
06:07:28.948 --> 06:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
to hear theill sponsor state that this
 
06:07:30.788 --> 06:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to foster care because
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
that significantly would impact uh
 
06:07:35.910 --> 06:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
certain employees and and impact morale
 
06:07:37.310 --> 06:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
of certain employees at the department
 
06:07:39.190 --> 06:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
as well who are currently serving in a
 
06:07:40.628 --> 06:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
very important capacity as Foster
 
06:07:42.390 --> 06:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
appearance so with that that concludes
 
06:07:44.270 --> 06:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
my testimony but I am available for
 
06:07:45.670 --> 06:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
questions I did want to acknowledge I
 
06:07:47.868 --> 06:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
also have our chief Deputy legal counsel
 
06:07:49.468 --> 06:07:49.478 align:start position:0%
who's here for moral support with me his
 
06:07:51.468 --> 06:07:51.478 align:start position:0%
name is uh John Martin he's in the
 
06:07:53.830 --> 06:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
audience here today and also helped with
 
06:07:56.110 --> 06:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
this fiscal analysis um on this bill
 
06:07:58.150 --> 06:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
along with our funing cial managers and
 
06:08:01.070 --> 06:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
staff over at DCF thank you
 
06:08:02.270 --> 06:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and then
 
06:08:02.280 --> 06:08:03.430 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and then
representative

06:08:03.430 --> 06:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:08:06.310 --> 06:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
Weber representative pushman after that
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:08:11.868 --> 06:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
taking this question are there other um
 
06:08:15.590 --> 06:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
similar constraints on employment
 
06:08:20.270 --> 06:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
outside of um the employment of of
 
06:08:24.590 --> 06:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
regular DHHS employees that and how are
 
06:08:26.310 --> 06:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
those and how are those enforced that's
 
06:08:28.590 --> 06:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
a that's a a great question um in a
 
06:08:30.270 --> 06:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
prior life I was an assistant County
 
06:08:31.948 --> 06:08:31.958 align:start position:0%
attorney and there's actually
 
06:08:34.110 --> 06:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
legislation in place that say you can't
 
06:08:36.110 --> 06:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
be engaged in the private practice I
 
06:08:38.270 --> 06:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
also understand I would defer to
 
06:08:40.350 --> 06:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
attorney Martin in the gallery that
 
06:08:42.070 --> 06:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
because we work for the state currently
 
06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
my role is legislative nature even
 
06:08:45.190 --> 06:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
though I am an active member of the
 
06:08:48.628 --> 06:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
thear uh but the issue over can you do
 
06:08:50.230 --> 06:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
private practice as well and I
 
06:08:51.230 --> 06:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
understand there's a proabition around
 
06:08:53.310 --> 06:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
it I'm just looking at John and he's
 
06:08:55.230 --> 06:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
going to give me a nod yes or
 
06:08:59.468 --> 06:08:59.478 align:start position:0%
no that's I have done some Pro and he
 
06:09:00.868 --> 06:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
said for the viewing audience that is
 
06:09:02.910 --> 06:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
correct but he has done some pro bono
 
06:09:05.868 --> 06:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
work uh as well so at least that's the
 
06:09:07.750 --> 06:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
one area that I could represent to you
 
06:09:09.910 --> 06:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
represent Shapiro that there have been
 
06:09:11.750 --> 06:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
laws in place because there might be an
 
06:09:14.270 --> 06:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
inherent conflict of interest in having
 
06:09:16.628 --> 06:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
somebody as an attorney serving in the
 
06:09:18.030 --> 06:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
public sector but then also in the
 
06:09:19.430 --> 06:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
private but I also would acknowledge in
 
06:09:21.390 --> 06:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire part-time
 
06:09:23.150 --> 06:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
judges are allowed because they don't
 
06:09:24.670 --> 06:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
make enough money to be able to do
 
06:09:26.110 --> 06:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
private practice or at least they did
 
06:09:27.670 --> 06:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
when I was actually appearing before
 
06:09:29.590 --> 06:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
them so that's the only ones that I can
 
06:09:32.750 --> 06:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
think of in uh State
 
06:09:35.310 --> 06:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
Statute okay representative Weber and
 
06:09:38.030 --> 06:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
then representative kushman thank you Mr
 
06:09:40.788 --> 06:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you I just wanted to ask
 
06:09:43.510 --> 06:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
you um I was writing but not quickly
 
06:09:47.030 --> 06:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
enough you said uh that this bill refers
 
06:09:47.040 --> 06:09:48.030 align:start position:0%
enough you said uh that this bill refers
to

06:09:48.030 --> 06:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:09:50.788 --> 06:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
126a and then you made a reference to a
 
06:09:52.670 --> 06:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
different statute which licensed foster
 
06:09:54.030 --> 06:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
parents and I was just wondering if you
 
06:09:55.910 --> 06:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
would give me that reference again yeah
 
06:09:57.430 --> 06:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
it contained in the Bill's fiscal
 
06:09:59.070 --> 06:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
analysis which is about five times
 
06:10:02.230 --> 06:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
longer than the bill to to your um um
 
06:10:03.430 --> 06:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for putting us through our
 
06:10:06.628 --> 06:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
PES represent hole um and so now now
 
06:10:09.510 --> 06:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
with some clarity it is in RSA chapter
 
06:10:12.590 --> 06:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
170e 170
 
06:10:14.948 --> 06:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
dase and it's also cited in the the
 
06:10:18.670 --> 06:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis representative kushman
 
06:10:20.708 --> 06:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
06:10:23.110 --> 06:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
Williams for taking my question you had
 
06:10:25.910 --> 06:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
said that there is um a third party who
 
06:10:28.190 --> 06:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
oversees like like Foster placement is
 
06:10:31.708 --> 06:10:31.718 align:start position:0%
that right uh there is and I would just
 
06:10:33.830 --> 06:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
represent you although I get involved
 
06:10:35.150 --> 06:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
with pretty much everything we
 
06:10:36.948 --> 06:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
practically do in the department I don't
 
06:10:38.788 --> 06:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
have the the folks from the foster care
 
06:10:40.310 --> 06:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
to give you the very specifics around it
 
06:10:42.150 --> 06:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
but I could certainly get you in touch
 
06:10:44.430 --> 06:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
with those folks who manage it because
 
06:10:46.430 --> 06:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
we would not allow our employees to be
 
06:10:48.070 --> 06:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
involved with being foster parents
 
06:10:49.390 --> 06:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
unless they had to meet the same
 
06:10:51.110 --> 06:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
criteria of any other individual serving
 
06:10:53.868 --> 06:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
as a foster parent and also the issue of
 
06:10:55.948 --> 06:10:55.958 align:start position:0%
you don't have the entity that is
 
06:10:58.110 --> 06:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
overseeing in that employee so there is
 
06:11:00.590 --> 06:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
a separation there uh that allows us to
 
06:11:03.350 --> 06:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
having those employees to service Foster
 
06:11:05.868 --> 06:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
um parents because we're not directly
 
06:11:07.990 --> 06:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
managing whether that's done through a
 
06:11:09.670 --> 06:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
procurement process we're having a third
 
06:11:11.430 --> 06:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
entity that's doing it but I can have
 
06:11:13.150 --> 06:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
somebody be in touch with you on the
 
06:11:15.030 --> 06:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
specifics around that um I would point
 
06:11:15.990 --> 06:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
out and we're happy to get you
 
06:11:17.708 --> 06:11:17.718 align:start position:0%
information I'm so happy to hear that
 
06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
the application here wasn't to foster
 
06:11:22.868 --> 06:11:22.878 align:start position:0%
parents or foster care program thank you
 
06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
I would love more information on
 
06:11:28.990 --> 06:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:33.948 --> 06:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:37.750 --> 06:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to testify is Joseph
 
06:11:43.910 --> 06:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:46.510 --> 06:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
is so you put down five minutes I'd
 
06:11:47.510 --> 06:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you could keep it
 
06:11:47.520 --> 06:11:52.430 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you could keep it
around

06:11:52.430 --> 06:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:54.628 --> 06:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
three yeah there you go I probably
 
06:11:57.910 --> 06:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
should have put down 15 minutes um I'm
 
06:12:01.788 --> 06:12:01.798 align:start position:0%
Joseph noon from hener and uh about a
 
06:12:03.628 --> 06:12:03.638 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago I started to get a
 
06:12:05.708 --> 06:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
uh pretty serious education on New
 
06:12:09.110 --> 06:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DCF actually the entire
 
06:12:11.590 --> 06:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
federal child protective service um
 
06:12:11.600 --> 06:12:12.948 align:start position:0%
federal child protective service um
industry

06:12:12.948 --> 06:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
industry
 
06:12:15.628 --> 06:12:15.638 align:start position:0%
itself uh with respect to this bill to
 
06:12:18.788 --> 06:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
uh you know prohibit uh dcyf employees
 
06:12:22.590 --> 06:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
from being involved in uh fost adoption
 
06:12:25.070 --> 06:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
agencies it has come to my attention
 
06:12:27.910 --> 06:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
upon uh research uh that it is
 
06:12:31.190 --> 06:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
essentially a well documented um
 
06:12:33.430 --> 06:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
situation in the United States where
 
06:12:36.350 --> 06:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
social workers are literally looking for
 
06:12:39.468 --> 06:12:39.478 align:start position:0%
babies to adopt because the adoption
 
06:12:42.788 --> 06:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
Market is um basically especially for
 
06:12:45.788 --> 06:12:45.798 align:start position:0%
healthy white babies uh it's like
 
06:12:48.190 --> 06:12:48.200 align:start position:0%
$50,000 to adopt one of those babies and
 
06:12:49.830 --> 06:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
you start doing some uh internet
 
06:12:51.948 --> 06:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
research on this uh and there's a
 
06:12:54.270 --> 06:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
waiting list of multiple years to even
 
06:12:57.070 --> 06:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
get a baby that is especially a white
 
06:12:59.590 --> 06:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
boy I have friends who have been waiting
 
06:13:02.150 --> 06:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
to adopt uh kids for years for example
 
06:13:04.750 --> 06:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
they explain this to me um my personal
 
06:13:07.750 --> 06:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
situation with uh New Hampshire DCF is
 
06:13:09.510 --> 06:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
where we had an extremely overaggressive
 
06:13:14.788 --> 06:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
social worker that was uh just hellbent
 
06:13:17.868 --> 06:13:17.878 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better description on uh
 
06:13:21.190 --> 06:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
getting involved in our life
 
06:13:23.510 --> 06:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
for I what I would call basically no
 
06:13:27.070 --> 06:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
good reason in fact this is a situation
 
06:13:29.910 --> 06:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
that uh right in the local town of hker
 
06:13:31.350 --> 06:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
there was actually another family where
 
06:13:33.468 --> 06:13:33.478 align:start position:0%
the parents were drug addicts uh kids
 
06:13:34.830 --> 06:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
living in a horrible
 
06:13:38.510 --> 06:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
situation and the um social workers
 
06:13:40.510 --> 06:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
weren't even interested in talking to or
 
06:13:42.868 --> 06:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
going about those families but in my
 
06:13:44.788 --> 06:13:44.798 align:start position:0%
particular case we have clear evidence
 
06:13:48.030 --> 06:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
of perjury uh at least two accounts uh
 
06:13:51.030 --> 06:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
on the behalf of the social workers and
 
06:13:53.510 --> 06:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
when I started asking people reaching
 
06:13:57.070 --> 06:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
out to people uh for questions I got
 
06:14:00.750 --> 06:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
some responses from some retired um dcyf
 
06:14:03.590 --> 06:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
social workers and other people who have
 
06:14:05.990 --> 06:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
been involved and targeted by
 
06:14:08.990 --> 06:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
DCF um or and claim they've been
 
06:14:11.510 --> 06:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
harassed by them that they're like Jay
 
06:14:13.750 --> 06:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
you have and people know me as Jay but
 
06:14:16.468 --> 06:14:16.478 align:start position:0%
they said Jay you have healthy children
 
06:14:19.510 --> 06:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
and they are very valuable to adopt out
 
06:14:22.788 --> 06:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
and that uh and a social worker in my
 
06:14:26.110 --> 06:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
case who happens to be a lesbian um and
 
06:14:28.990 --> 06:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with that situation in
 
06:14:31.868 --> 06:14:31.878 align:start position:0%
fact I know multiple gay couples who
 
06:14:33.868 --> 06:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
have done a fantastic job raising
 
06:14:36.468 --> 06:14:36.478 align:start position:0%
adopted kids and even their biological
 
06:14:39.670 --> 06:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
kids uh but they were what was expressed
 
06:14:42.030 --> 06:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
to me by people who are aware of these
 
06:14:44.230 --> 06:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
situations uh not only in New Hampshire
 
06:14:46.750 --> 06:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
but also throughout the states is that
 
06:14:49.670 --> 06:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's an agenda for the uh people who
 
06:14:51.230 --> 06:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
essentially aren't having children for
 
06:14:52.628 --> 06:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
whatever reason they have a lot of
 
06:14:54.628 --> 06:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
friends that aren't having childr for
 
06:14:57.670 --> 06:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
whatever reasons to come up with
 
06:14:59.230 --> 06:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
valuable children to put into the
 
06:15:01.750 --> 06:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
adoption system there is a documentary
 
06:15:03.030 --> 06:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
if you guys would like to write this
 
06:15:05.510 --> 06:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
down that I think that you should watch
 
06:15:08.510 --> 06:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
it is called saving baby Cyrus and this
 
06:15:10.430 --> 06:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
is a situation that happened I believe
 
06:15:10.440 --> 06:15:11.190 align:start position:0%
is a situation that happened I believe
in

06:15:11.190 --> 06:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:15:15.230 --> 06:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
Nevada um where uh essentially the baby
 
06:15:18.230 --> 06:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
was taken by Child Protective Services
 
06:15:20.390 --> 06:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
with with the intent to adopt out right
 
06:15:23.350 --> 06:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
away and there is multiple cases of this
 
06:15:26.868 --> 06:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
in fact you can internet search New
 
06:15:29.830 --> 06:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dcyf settlements and just
 
06:15:31.628 --> 06:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
start reading articles about the
 
06:15:33.708 --> 06:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
liabilities that the taxpayers have had
 
06:15:35.670 --> 06:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
to pay out wrapping up your testimony
 
06:15:37.868 --> 06:15:37.878 align:start position:0%
yes I I'm I'm getting to that uh I
 
06:15:40.910 --> 06:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
believe uh it is a a massive conflict of
 
06:15:45.670 --> 06:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
interest if um uh social workers for
 
06:15:47.830 --> 06:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
that work for New Hampshire DCF that
 
06:15:49.708 --> 06:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
first off receive financial in
 
06:15:54.628 --> 06:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
incentives uh via title 4 um are
 
06:15:57.868 --> 06:15:57.878 align:start position:0%
involved with or working for uh adoption
 
06:16:00.788 --> 06:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
agencies and it is also a creates
 
06:16:03.510 --> 06:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
massive liability for the taxpayers and
 
06:16:06.868 --> 06:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
if you uh getting to I believe the term
 
06:16:10.430 --> 06:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
is um I forget what it is it's like a a
 
06:16:12.990 --> 06:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
hunting for adoptive babies or something
 
06:16:14.390 --> 06:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
and you start looking into that on the
 
06:16:16.670 --> 06:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
internet you will see that there is
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
multiple situations where states have
 
06:16:21.548 --> 06:16:21.558 align:start position:0%
paid out heavy heavy settlements to
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
children that were wrongfully taken and
 
06:16:26.270 --> 06:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
put right into adoption programs quite
 
06:16:28.310 --> 06:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
literally because there is just a big
 
06:16:31.150 --> 06:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
Market to adopt Healthy Babies thank you
 
06:16:33.270 --> 06:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
06:16:37.750 --> 06:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:39.990 --> 06:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
sir uh no one else has signed up to
 
06:16:41.670 --> 06:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
testify on hb1
 
06:16:44.590 --> 06:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
