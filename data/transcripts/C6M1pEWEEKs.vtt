thank you for having me this afternoon

I'm here to present uh to this committee
 
00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 align:start position:0%
my recommended budget for fiscal years
 
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
2026 and
 
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
2027 uh as I said yesterday this is a
 
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
budget for All of New Hampshire and in
 
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
accomplishing the unnecessary
 
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
recalibration uh this responsible budget
 
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
protects New Hampshire's vulnerable and
 
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
youth while continuing Investments to
 
00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 align:start position:0%
Drive New Hampshire's Dynamic economy
 
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
and way of life uh this budget sends
 
00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
more money to the local level and spends
 
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
more on education than ever
 
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
before it begins the overhaul of the
 
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
group two retirement system to make good
 
00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
on our promise and to keep those who
 
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
serve our state and our localities uh to
 
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can recruit and retain
 
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
the very best it delivers uh record
 
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
levels of spending for special education
 
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
nearly a 50% higher than the last bium
 
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
expands education freedom to all public
 
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
school students uh will help get the
 
00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
cell phones out of the classroom
 
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
continues the tuition frees at the
 
00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
community colleges colleges and ensures
 
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
no weight list for persons with
 
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
disabilities also streamlines the
 
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
permitting process for housing and
 
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
there's certainly much more in the
 
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
budget we put this budget together the
 
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way uh by taking a close
 
00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
look at how we spend taxpayer dollars
 
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
and by not raising
 
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
taxes in comparison to our last budget
 
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
we are spending $150 million less in
 
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.030 align:start position:0%
we are spending $150 million less in
general

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
funds this adjud adjustment was done
 
00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully and in close collaboration
 
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
with our
 
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
commissioners my proposed budget
 
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
represents a recalibration of our
 
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
approach to the way New Hampshire does
 
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
business both the total amount of
 
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
spending and also the way in which we
 
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
Steward each taxpayer
 
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
dollars before we talk about the
 
00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
upcoming bium we need to recap the
 
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
current bium and some of the lessons
 
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
learned from that the 21% increase in
 
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
general fund spending in the fiscal year
 
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
20124 and 2025 bym uh was it's
 
00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 align:start position:0%
unsustainable while the 12% pay increase
 
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
for state employees was overdue and
 
00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
important uh paying for that pay raise
 
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
with surplus funds instead of revenue
 
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
from the current banum uh put an undue
 
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
burden on the budget for fiscal year
 
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start position:0%
2026 and
 
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
2027 in addition the fiscal year 2024
 
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
2025 budget that passed the legislature
 
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh that didn't have any money go in the
 
00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund at the end end of the
 
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
bium it also uh didn't account for a
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
potential drop in revenues or off budget
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
spending and we have had both and while
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 general fund revenues
 
00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:56.830 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 general fund revenues
were

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
126.4 million over plan through the
 
00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
first 7 months of fiscal year 25
 
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
revenues are below plan by 39 million
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
compounding the problem was roughly $100
 
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
million of off-budget spending that
 
00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
occurred in fiscal year
 
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
2024 uh therefore the result of having
 
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
no safety margin in the budget the
 
00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
downturn in the revenues and the $100
 
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
million in off budget spending means
 
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
that fiscal year 25 general fund is
 
00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 align:start position:0%
spending is projected to close with an
 
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
operating deficit of 154.181
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
and an overall deficit of 81 million now
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
I know the legislature will address this
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
I also want you to know um that I am
 
00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 align:start position:0%
looking closely at current bium spending
 
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh as it comes to the governor and
 
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
Council and we've also put in place a
 
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.510 align:start position:0%
Council and we've also put in place a
hiring

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
freeze despite the challenges um these
 
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
challenges that I just talked about I'm
 
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
nevertheless optimistic about our
 
00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
economy the positioning of New Hampshire
 
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
and that our business revenues will
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
Rebound in 26 and
 
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
27 uh we are outperforming our neighbors
 
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
we have the strongest job growth in New
 
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
England and new business startups are
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
exceeding the national average and we're
 
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
also beating our neighbors in a number
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
of other metrics we have a tax and
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
Regulatory environment that continues to
 
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
allow New Hampshire to attract new
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
businesses and new talent but to keep it
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
that way we have to protect the New
 
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Advantage by living within our
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
means and and not by not raising
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
taxes we must balance budget and rain in
 
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
off budget spending that forces us to
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
draw from the rainy day
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
fund this budget that I'm proposing uh
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
protects services for our most
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
vulnerable citizens we found other ways
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
to cut spending asking e each agency to
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
do more with less reducing uh some
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
bloated out ofate contracts eliminating
 
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
funding uh for empty desks and so we've
 
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
looked across the board and you know we
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the legislature
 
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
will do that as well I understand that
 
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
Rising costs are a concern for everyone
 
00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
and some of the most important work in
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
this state is done at the local level
 
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to say that this budget sends
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
more money back to local communities
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
than ever before it also sends spends
 
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
more money on education than ever before
 
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
it's critical that we provide our next
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
generation with a best-in-class
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
education and our our budget priorities
 
00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 align:start position:0%
reflect that the state will invest in my
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
proposed budget 98.8 million in special
 
00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:42.759 align:start position:0%
education which is nearly a 50% increase
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
over the last panium we will continue to
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
invest heavily in our public schools
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
with more money than ever and we will
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
also expand eligibility for Education
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
freedom to every public school
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
student uh and we and importantly we
 
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
hope to remove distractions from the
 
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
classrooms by the way of cell phones um
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
getting class cell phones out of our
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
classrooms are going to help students
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
focus and master the fundamentals they
 
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
need to succeed uh we're making a
 
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars available in Grants for
 
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
school districts to develop individual
 
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
approaches uh to pursue this goal and I
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
can tell you this is a worthwhile
 
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
investment the research shows that
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
taking cell phones out of the classrooms
 
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
will increase test scores reduce cyber
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
bullying and frankly just improve the
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
communication uh with our students among
 
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.150 align:start position:0%
communication uh with our students among
each

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
other in addition when it comes to
 
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
education our community colleges play a
 
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
vital role in helping Granite Staters on
 
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
their path to a good paying career over
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
the last three banial budgets the
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
community colleges have kept their
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
tuitions flat and they've been able to
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
freeze tuition uh for residents and they
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
have they provide a high quality
 
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
education my budget continues this
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
tuition freeze because I want to make
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
sure that the community colleges are as
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
accessible to as many people in New
 
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
possible we have also continued to
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
invest in Workforce training the trades
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
and credent credentialing programs to
 
00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
increase the workforce that we need uh
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
areas like electrical HVAC welding
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
Automotive Commercial Driving nursing
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
and mental health and other high demand
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
careers whether students choose to
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
pursue career in technical education a
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
two-year degree or further their
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
education after the Community College at
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
our University our investments are
 
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
important in helping building the
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
workforce of
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
Tomorrow our state consistently ranks as
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
the safest state in the nation and we
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
have phenomenal First Responders in this
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
state however we're facing a recruitment
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
and retention crisis um it's something I
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
heard so much about on the campaign
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
Trail uh we have a gap with our state
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
police we have a gap with our
 
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers and I know each of
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know that locally challenges in
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
terms of gaps for law law enforcement
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
and for
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
firefighters our First Responders uh one
 
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
of the challenges that I heard a lot
 
00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
about is that our retirement system just
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
not competitive anymore relative to
 
00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
other states our First Responders should
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
receive a fair and competitive
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
retirement if we want to continue to
 
00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
recruit the very best uh law enforcement
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
and firefighters in the country country
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
and then keep those who are serving now
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
this is why my budget invests $33
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
million in the group two retirement
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
system to begin to make it more
 
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
competitive and to retain our First
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
Responders this is done by revenue from
 
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
the transition from historical horse
 
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
racing racing uh to VT machines or
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as slots this transition
 
00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
uh will also result in more revenue for
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
Education uh which which is important as
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
well in terms of keeping New Hampshire
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
safe my budget continues the northern
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
border Alliance which has been an
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
effective deterrent at our northern
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
border it provides 2.5 million in
 
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
funding for drug interdiction through
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
the granite Shield program it as well as
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
an additional million dollars for a new
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
Northern Shield program which will focus
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
on Coos Grafton Carol and Sullivan
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
counties uh this will help keep this
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
deadly poison off of our
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
streets we are also ensuring that the
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
state has the resources uh to get
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
Justice for victims of crimes and
 
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
support children who have been
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
victimized as they go through the court
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
system so the budget includes a funding
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
a continued funding for the child
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
advocacy centers the internet crimes
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
against children task force Casa and
 
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
funding to continue critical protection
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
for victims of crime to address a gap
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
created by the reduced Federal victims
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
of crime act funds
 
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
from our cities and towns to our rural
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
communities we must ensure that every
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
Granite Stater has access to the health
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
care that they need so the budget
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
includes uh care for those struggling
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
with mental health uh as well as those
 
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
with disabilities uh in making sure that
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
they can seek treatment and that they
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
get the help that they need and support
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
our investments at the Department of
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services will allow us
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
to provide granted Staters uh with
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
access to critical Services over a
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
billion dollars uh proposed for the
 
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
badium to fund services for Citizens
 
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that there continues to be no

weight list $10 million over the banian
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
for the uncompensated care experienced
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
by our community mental health centers
 
00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they remain an adequate
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
and important safety net uh for
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Services and support
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
in our state we also found areas um in
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
addition to make responsible adjustments
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
that bring us in line with the times and
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing uh we
 
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
brought our adult Medicaid Eligibility
 
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
back in line with prepandemic levels so
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
back to 2020 and we joined our neighbors
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
and requiring nominal co-pays for those
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
who are receiving
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
benefits we will continue working
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
together uh to meet the physical and
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
mental care needs of our rural
 
00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:28.839 align:start position:0%
communities people with disabilities our
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
senior senors and everyone across our
 
00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:35.959 align:start position:0%
state our state's most critical economic
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
need is more housing for our Workforce
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
for our seniors for our families for all
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire you've all heard about
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
it um my budget streamlines permitting
 
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959 align:start position:0%
and creates an efficient and firm 60-day
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
process we've got to get more building
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
done get it quickly and build housing of
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
all forms we are in The Proposal in my
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
budget uh reduced reducing our
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
permitting system from a fragmented and
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
uncoordinated approach involving four
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
agencies to two state agencies who will
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
coordinate in a transparent process we
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
will consolidate the permitting review
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
operations currently in fish and game
 
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Natural and
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
cultural resources into the Department
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
of Environmental
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
Services this will allow for a more
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
efficient transparent permitting process
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
that will give homeown owners and
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
Builders an answer within 60
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
days it's the first step in ensuring
 
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
that we are a good actor as a state and
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
set a model for local communities to
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
follow as we respond to the critical
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
housing shortage that our state
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
faces to maintain our standing as the
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
beacon of the Northeast and adjust to
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
the revenue environment that we find
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves in uh some recalibrations were
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
needed but we have been very thoughtful
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
in this budget and taking care to ensure
 
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
that these recalibrations are not felt
 
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
by those who depend upon us the most I
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
look forward to partnering with members
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
of this committee and the legislature to
 
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that we meet Our obligation to
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
deliver a responsible balanced budget to
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
rein in off- budget spending to make
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we take care of those who
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
depend on the state for critical
 
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
services and are our most
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and to deliver for everyone
 
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire together I know that we can
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
work to craft a a budget and I believe
 
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
my proposal does that and I look forward
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
to working with each of you on your
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
ideas to make sure that there's even
 
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
greater prosperity in the next bium for
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%

00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and I look forward to
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
answering your questions and Happy
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day to
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you Governor we
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate your leadership and we share
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
your goals to keeping New Hampshire
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
great as you know the bottom line we
 
00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
deal with comes from the house Ways and
 
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
Means Committee that's that's our limit
 
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
on what we can spend so it gives us a
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
challenge and preliminarily there's been
 
00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:13.959 align:start position:0%
a difference between what they see as as
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
revenue and what your budget proposes so
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
we may have to be making some further
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
adjustments as we go and I hope you will
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
support them but so far I don't think
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
that U slot machine thing has been
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
passed so we're waiting hopefully while
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
we're in the process maybe that will
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
become law and those may go forward Mr
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
chairman I can say also that our Revenue
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
estimates or were based on you know in
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
consultation with the Department of
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration and the um Chiefs
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh the state's Chief Economist Brian
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
gotle and we brought everyone together
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
around the table for those estimates
 
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
that are contained within our
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
budget very good questions from
 
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative Mari there you go
 
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
it's only been eight years
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
governor for being here and for giving
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
me something to do on an upcoming snowy
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
Sunday well yeah that that's a lot of
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
reading on a a lot I have a you notice
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
the front of it is Pink So it helps so
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
there I appreciate the concern the
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
consideration there so um if you can
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
help me regarding the expansion of the
 
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
EFA program can you help me reconcile
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
your design desire for belt tightening
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
and being fiscally responsible while
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
responsibly stewarding The public's
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
money with an expansion of a program
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
that to my mind has no guard rails
 
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
unlike other similar programs in the
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
state has always come in way over budget
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
and doesn't have an accountability
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism um these this tax pair of
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
money that we're you know talking about
 
00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:50.839 align:start position:0%
and so can you help me address some of
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
those issues so our representative maray
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
I can say this first of all uh we are
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
making a historic investment in public
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
education so there is
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
more money in this budget invested in
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
public education I'm the product of
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
public education as is my husband so I
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
certainly believe very strongly in it
 
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
and we've invested in this budget same
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
thing with special education as well uh
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at these numbers in terms of
 
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.710 align:start position:0%
if you look at these numbers in terms of
Education

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
Freedom I'm a huge fan of the public
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
schools and they do such important work
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
but not every child is succeeding in our
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
public schools and so providing
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
education freedom for any student who's
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
in public school will give every child
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to succeed in the
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
setting that is best for him or her and
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's a very worthy investment
 
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
for our state especially as we look at
 
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
our overall investment in education and
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
our continued uh support and focus on
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
continue representative Ms thank thank
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and U thank you governor
 
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:00.039 align:start position:0%
for uh for coming in and thank you to uh
 
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
you and your team for putting in the
 
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
time to uh put this budget together I
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
know it's not easy um and uh we we we
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate it I also know that
 
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
in order to put the budget together
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
there has to be a delicate balance
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
between State revenues General funds and
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
federal funds with that in mind um what
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
what portion of the federal funds
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
assumed in this budget are at risk if
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
the administration in Washington um um
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
moves forward with the freeze on federal
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
funding uh well representative thank you
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
for the question and and and you've also
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
reminded me that I need to introduce the
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
most important person that helped me
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
with this which is James Jerry so I
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
apolog my my budget director who put in
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
a ton of work on this budget and I'm
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
very very grateful to so glad to have
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
him here with me today and I I will say
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh your answer we have built
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
a a budget based on what the revenues we
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
have now and the opportunities we have
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
and uh you know certainly I'm confident
 
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
in where we are with our federal
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
revenues and and and I will say that
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
we've also been in touch with the White
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
House to get further information but the
 
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
budget that we have proposed to you uh
 
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
right now the funding is continued for
 
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.270 align:start position:0%
right now the funding is continued for
those

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
areas representative Lehman for a
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and nice
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
to see you I think in my nine terms this
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
is probably the most challenging budget
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
I've seen so uh thanks for your efforts
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
to put it together and I guess I
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate your optimism about revenues
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
because as you know uh business revenues
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
are down by over a 100 million liquor
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
revenues are down and for me I don't see
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
that changing but my question U is
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't get a lot of
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
attention like our our bridges you can
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
see they have a weight restriction on
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
them but our dams in the state which we
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
have like 260 sad that are controlled by
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
the state you have about uh 10 million
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
doar I believe in that line item and
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
based on a recent report that was done
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
we need about $400 million to address
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
these hazardous dams that exist across
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
the state I didn't know if you might
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
have a plan or at least plant the seed
 
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:15.559 align:start position:0%
of how we might address that failing
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure with our dams yeah um I'm
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know I I appreciate the question
 
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
representative lman and we'll let you
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
know that uh there there's also some
 
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
resources that we proposed in the
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
capital budget I will let um James speak
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
to that yeah we have about 13 million in
 
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
the capital budget that that's an
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
addition to to that money uh and we are
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
working with the uh Department of
 
00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:41.799 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to to address the
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
damn issues they have certainly brought
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
that to our attention uh they believe it
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
is a a serious problem with a very large
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
price tag and uh we're going to be
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
working with them over the next year to
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh to find ways to to fund that problem
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things they're looking at are
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
are in increasing the the fees in dams
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
and we've agreed to uh a possible 10%
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
across the board increase on those
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
although that's not final yet and uh
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
they they you know asked for something
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
significantly higher but uh we know we
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
want to go too much too fast and so
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
that's one of the ways that will pump
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
more money into the system uh if we go
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
with that recommendation in order to get
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
the uh more repairs done on those dams
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
but we we do recognize that that is a
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
problem thank you and thank you Mr
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Edwards for a
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
you U Madam governor for taking my
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
question I um I think with uh the it's
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's a little unfortunate on the timing
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
of the budget given the enormous change
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at in DC I mean other
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
than the Department of Education and the
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
HHS nothing much is happening in DC
 
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to affect us but uh but on
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
a serious note with so much change I
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
think we have a potential for great
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity as well terms of waivers and
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
block grants and with your experience in
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
DC I I'm hoping that that you're you're
 
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:11.559 align:start position:0%
making an early prioritized trip to go
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
down and advocate for the kinds of
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
federal changes that we'll really we can
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
really leverage here uh well thank you
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I'm actually
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
going to the National Governor's
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
association meeting next week uh in
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
Washington and we're going to have an
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity trying to meet with some of
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
the cabinet officials there that were're
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
able most of them just got sworn in so
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to see who we can meet with
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
and uh and advocate for New Hampshire
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I hope to Advocate
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
across the board is that if you send us
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
the same amount of resources but block
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
rant them I believe that we can get more
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
done for the people of New Hampshire and
 
00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
do so effectively working with the
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
legislature on how we spend resources so
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
if that's a decision made um I can tell
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
you that we can stretch the federal
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
dollars a lot further than the a lot of
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
the you know kind of restrictions they
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
put on funding in Washington we could do
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
it the New Hampshire way thank
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
you representative Mooney for a question
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Governor
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
it's always a pleasure to see you
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
excellent address yesterday excellent
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
presentation today your priorities are
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
spoton we've heard about all of these on
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
the campaign Trail housing education it
 
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
goes on and on and you've hit it all
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
here the level of detail
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
fantastic you mentioned one new position
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
and that was in the Cold Case unit in
 
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
the AG's office I remember in the early
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
days meeting with you as AG to discuss
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
the implementation of a Cold Case unit
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
so my question is why the need for the
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
position is it because cold cases have
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
increased or the workload increased
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you representative
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
Mooney I appreciate it and I will say we
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
did fund an additional full-time Cold
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
Case Investigator uh for the Attorney
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
General's office in this budget and but
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
we also did it uh we were able to shift
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
some funds so we did it in a fiscally
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
responsible way uh the reason I I put
 
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
that in the budget is having been a
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
former murder prosecutor myself and
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
having met with several victims of crime
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
and Cold Case uh victims and families on
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
the campaign Trail I heard about the
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
need to really put more resources into
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
looking at these cases these cases are
 
00:24:36.669 --> 00:24:36.679 align:start position:0%
often challenging but when you re look
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
at these cases and you dig into these
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
cases further especially with new
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
forensics and new new um you know
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
investigative techniques you can solve
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
them and so I felt this was an area
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
after speaking with the attorney general
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
and also hearing from victims uh on the
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
campaign trail that we should invest a
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
full-time investigator to really focus
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
on these cases and hopefully we can
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
solve more and give closure to these
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
families representative walner for a
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
chairman and so nice to see you and
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh joining us this
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon Governor I have a couple of
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
questions about Workforce sure um one I
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to know if there in your budget
 
00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039 align:start position:0%
is included a pay raise for the state
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
employees yes there is the one the the
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining the one that's
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
already been bargained or are you asking
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
for a future let me clarify that uh that
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
is not in this budget so it's the the
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
one that was just bargain and of course
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
adhering to the collective bargain
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
agreement of the increase that came I
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
believe was a 12% that is funded in this
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
budget and my other question is do you
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
anticipate in this budget um unfunded
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
positions in this budget um I think are
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
you asking me whether there is anyone
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
who is laid off in this budget is that
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
the so there are four so there are eight
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
positions uh across state government
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
four in the department of administrative
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
Services due to the end of a program and
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
then there are four in doit as you know
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
the way doit works it's transfers from
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
other agencies uh so in reducing funding
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
so there are eight positions and I can
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
tell you that I've been in touch with
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
the head of the sea I have a hiring
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
freeze in place but I have said um that
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
if there are positions that open up to
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
that those eight individuals can be
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
rehired in state government I will wave
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
that hiring freeze to make sure that
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
those eight individuals are taken care
 
00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:48.039 align:start position:0%
of um and so that they can continue in
 
00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:50.630 align:start position:0%
of um and so that they can continue in
state

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
service representative PRI for a
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
you governor for being here and happy
 
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day well thank you um in
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
your speech you mentioned um the need
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
for more housing in the state and you
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
have provide us with a streamline
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
regulations initiative and I think
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea uh and uh but also
 
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
what we need and what we've been hearing
 
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
from our constituents is the need for
 
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and affordable child
 
00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.269 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and affordable child
care

00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't see anything that mentions
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
how we're going to achieve that can you
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
um talk further about that uh
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
representative I I will say this week I
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to uh visit a great
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
example of how we can partner with local
 
00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
communities and why permitting is so so
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
important and it's why it's in my budget
 
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.509 align:start position:0%
important and it's why it's in my budget
uh

00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
because time is money and on these
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
projects and with inflation and other
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
contexts prices can go up so in Kean
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
just recently I was there with the mayor
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
Khan the mayor of Kean uh also a private
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
developer uh the city councilors were
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
there I think it was Tuesday or
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I was there uh they have
 
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
created small homes and they've actually
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
moved in four or five seniors that were
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
displaced from their homes from flooding
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
and one of the things the developers
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
told me there is like keep keep it up on
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
the permitting because they were able to
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
do that project in seven months because
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
Kean was so Cooperative uh and the
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
faster we can get these projects done
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
the better and that's why permitting uh
 
00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
is in my budget but the way we're going
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
to create more and these are affordable
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
units affordable housing but the way
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to create more affordable
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
housing is uh to make sure that a when
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
you want to invest in it you get a quick
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
answer so you can get it done B uh I
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
plan to also bring people together to
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
build those kinds of Partnerships
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh Partners from Partners from like New
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing on the finance HUD on
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
the federal level and also uh local
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
communities along with this making sure
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
the state's a good actor I think that is
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
how we're going to drive more affordable
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
housing and I saw many examples on the
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
campaign trail of this for example there
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
was a great project in Rochester that
 
00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:22.519 align:start position:0%
brought a number of affordable housing
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
units online and that was a combination
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire housing HUD the state
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
and private development and so I think
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
that's the way we're going to do this
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
and that's why I emphasize permitting on
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
this because I heard so much about it as
 
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
I was meeting people out on the trail
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
let's get that done uh and then also
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
let's make sure um you know that we can
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
build those those types of Partnerships
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
to build more housing and this is an
 
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
issue that's not partisan it's just
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
something we all need to work on
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
together yeah represent if I could if I
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
could add that uh the governor had us
 
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:01.519 align:start position:0%
meet with with neighbor Works uh this
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
week which provides a lot of the
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
low-income housing through the state and
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
and that meeting was very beneficial
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
because in in addition to uh funding
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
which which they definitely need uh so
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
which is which is why we have uh funded
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
the low-income housing fund which is why
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
we've extended the housing Champions
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
funding uh and we've worked with the New
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing to make sure they've
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
had the bonding capacity
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh certainly for the for the first part
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
of 2025 we'll continue to work with them
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the year to make sure they
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
have the bonding capacity to do it but
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
in addition to funding one of the things
 
00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:40.519 align:start position:0%
they've said which which works right in
 
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
with our 60-day permitting uh plan is
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
that what they run into is the not in my
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
backyard type thing where uh you know
 
00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
everyone wants low-income housing just
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
don't put it near me And so we're going
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
to have to really work uh a lot harder
 
00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
with municipalities to come up with
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
plans to uh you know enable these these
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
housing projects to get built and that's
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
what the governor's plan I think that's
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
a misperception too because it's it's
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing these are our friends
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
these are our neighbors these are these
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
are the teachers these are the
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
firefighters the policemen these are you
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
know the people that are building um you
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
know working in The Local Company that's
 
00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:24.039 align:start position:0%
building something important for all of
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
us so I think we need to make sure we
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
get the right terminology too when we
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
think about our housing well followup
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question all of
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
these are great solutions to the problem
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
of affordable housing I used to be on
 
00:31:43.149 --> 00:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
the board of directors for neighbor
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
works and I know that's it's a solid
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
organization what about daycare centers
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
child care this is a vital issue for our
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
Workforce making sure that it's
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
affordable for our working granded
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
stator so I would say about child care
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
two things um you know the
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
legislature extended the eligibility of
 
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
the child care scholarships that
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
continues in this budget and that's been
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
really helpful to many families in
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
addition to that uh one of the things
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
when we think about the credentialing uh
 
00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
resources and investments in our
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
community colleges that will also be
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
used to focus on our child care
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
Workforce representative Sweeney for a
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
you guys governor for being here and for
 
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
the budget proposal just to Echo the
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
comments on permitting reform I can
 
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
speak as the town of Salem for years
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
this town has aggressively approved
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
projects that have then languished in
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
state permitting so I I believe that
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
60-day window is going to be a game Cher
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire and
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
certainly uh in combination with the c
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
Pacer legislation that we're sending to
 
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
your office uh come July 1st with the
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
60-day permitting and C Pacer we can
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
really see a historic era of development
 
00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire um and
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's going to impact secondhand effect
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
on the revenues from the business taxes
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
and whatnot just curious if your
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
revenues are predicting any changes from
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
those efforts or if that's going to be
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
above and beyond what we're seeing in
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
economic growth for the next two years
 
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
we didn't account for that in our
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
revenue and and I do want to commend you
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
for passing that legislation the C Pacer
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
I look forward to uh having that come to
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
my desk I think that was a very
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
important bipartisan effort uh so I
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
would say that our revenue is really
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
focused on our economic growth our new
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
startups but the more housing we have of
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
course it's going to all come together
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
because as we one of the issues as we
 
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
Recruit new businesses here or they
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
choose to locate here they need housing
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
for their Workforce that's critical and
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
so it is all related uh but really our
 
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates and thinking there's
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a rebound with regard to
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
business taxes is just the data that we
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
see underlying um here in New Hampshire
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
and we're you know we are I'm very
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
optimistic that we're we're going to do
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
well in the next B any you know the last
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
coming into this obviously was quite
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
exuberant uh so it will be a
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
recalibration but I think that business
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
revenues will R
 
00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
out yeah if I could add just a little
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
bit on the revenues uh as as the
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
governor said um we we really put uh
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh Lindsay Steep and and
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
and Ryan gotlib in a room and said you
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
know because I I know a lot about tax
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
collection I know a lot about the
 
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
economy but there's no one who knows
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
more about tax collection in the state
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
than commissioner stepp does and there's
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
no one knows more about the new hamper
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
economy than Brian gotb does and so
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
putting them two together and coming up
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
with with this range uh I think was was
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
a great step and uh I had a nice
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
conversation with the chairman of the
 
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
the house Ways and Means and we
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
discussed our where we are uh I think uh
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
anything within those ranges are
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable although we do disagree and
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why we disagree is i
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
i i caution against what I call recency
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
bias is that what's happening now is
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
going to go on forever that what we have
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
here now is uh you know going to
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
continue I use a sports analogy and I
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
can bring the Patriots up uh a few years
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
ago when they had uh they got they they
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
were Stillen Brady was there there were
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
they got beaten badly by Kansas City one
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
day and everyone was saying that that's
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
the end of the dynasty that was it
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's no more hope that was the onto
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
Cincinnati comment that he's become
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
famous for and since then they played in
 
00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
four more Super Bowls and won three of
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
them so it's it's it's it's a matter of
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
thinking that what's now is going to
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
always be I think the New Hampshire
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
economy is as strong as it's ever been
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's becoming more Diversified by the
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
day I mean literally we have gone from a
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
state that has been dominated by paper
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
mills to where we are now growing human
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
organs that's the difference this state
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
has has been transformed over the last
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
few decades and uh we we see that
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
continuing the governor has said uh
 
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
rightly that we are outpacing everyone
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
in New England as far as job growth goes
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
and uh we we see that uh with the
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
changes that uh have been made over the
 
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
last decade or so and with the changes
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to make now to uh encourage
 
00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
his businesses to come into the state
 
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
that that will continue and that uh
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
revenues will reflect those uh changes
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tki for a
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much Mr chairman
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh we
 
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
touched on this very briefly but um your
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
discussion of transitioning to slot
 
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
machines um we're talking about $127
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
million in Revenue which is which is
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
quite robust so I'm just curious how
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
this would impact our existing
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
charitable charitable gaming program and
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
the nonprofits that rely so heavily on
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
this um these funds thank you it's a
 
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
pretty significant increase for the
 
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
Charities as well because it's an
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
increase for the law enforcement but an
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
increase for education and also an
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
increase in revenue for the Charities
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
transition I didn't know a lot about
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
this but now I learned more um that to
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
VTS from historical horse racing is just
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
it the revenue is going to be much
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
higher the estimates according to the
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
lottery uh commission and so that is
 
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
where we got those numbers but the
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
well represent Stringham for a question
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for coming and and we
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
share uh your goals as well I appreciate
 
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
uh your time with us yesterday and today
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
um inflation is still uh a factor as as
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned even though it's down
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
from where it was um my question relates
 
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
to the Medicaid rates uh we're uh some
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
of them are are uh already uh low enough
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
where uh it's difficult for the people
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
we count on to provide services for the
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh patients and the Medicaid
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
waiver patients uh to keep them up we
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
were able to make some Target
 
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
adjustments significant adjustments uh
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
last term uh uh so the questions I have
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
related to that are are the base levels
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
for this budget uh the same as they are
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
now and is there any funds available for
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
uh rate increases in areas where uh we
 
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
think um uh service dislocations will
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
occur and then uh if it's okay I'll
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
follow questions on the Medicaid co-pay
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
question sure uh and I'm gonna also have
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
James follow up but the the rates are
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
where you put them so um that's
 
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
contained so we haven't brought back
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
rates uh to Prior levels yet there were
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
increases in there and those are still
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
in this budget um and there were some
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
areas that uh and that's why I'm going
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
to turn to James where we made some
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
calibration upward as well um I'll just
 
00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
give you an example I just remember well
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
which is uh you know for homeless
 
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
shelters there was federal funds used
 
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
they received what was it $20 a day per
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
individual they were taken care of and
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
then arpa funds were used to supplement
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
to bring them up to $27 a day uh so I
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
maintain the $27 a day for example on
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
that even though it was only funded
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
through arpa as opposed to the general
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
funds because I just thought that was
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
really important as we think about our
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
homeless shelters and um and I'm sure
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
that's still very difficult even with
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
the $27 a day so that is an area um and
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
then there are other I believe areas but
 
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll defer to James on that yeah
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
that was that was that was obviously a
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
large one because that that money that
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
was was arpa funed and and wasn't in the
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
budget so we have to if if we flat
 
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
funded it it would go back to the $28 a
 
00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
day instead of the 27 that they that
 
00:39:58.309 --> 00:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
they clearly need so the governor funded
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
that at 27 a day the what uh the
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
governor's budget focuses on uh in in
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
addition to maintaining the the flat
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
level funding for for the for the rate
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
increases is the fact that what the
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care has done to some
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
providers really and not only the uh The
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
Fairly qualified Health Centers but the
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers as well
 
00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
and in fact that the governor has uh
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
asked for an appro ration of $10 million
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
$5 million per year to help the
 
00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers with
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
their uncompensated care uh that is a
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
significant problem we are concerned
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
that if they don't get this money that
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
they could go under which would be an
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
absolute disaster for the state um we
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
have made great progress in the mental
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
health area in in eradicating the weight
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
list from the hospitals from the
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms and bringing them back
 
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
into care and making sure that the
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center ERS has
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh their resources enough resources to
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh meet their needs going forward is a
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
is a big priority of the governor and
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's why she put in the $10 million
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
there thank you U followup you have a
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
followup yeah again related to Medicaid
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
is the co-pays and um uh you know
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
obviously that hasn't been through a
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
policy committee here so I'm wondering
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
to what extent we think the um uh the
 
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
amount that we'd be asking Medicaid
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
recipients to pay and co-pays uh would
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
be affordable uh and uh does it make the
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know program are we concerned that
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
make the program uh benefits
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
unattainable for some of the people are
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
in progam sure um so all the co-pays are
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
capped at a maximum of 5% of income and
 
00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
for some categories of individuals it's
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
only at the higher income levels versus
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
complete eligibility and in addition to
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
that uh we looked at this and I asked
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
what happens nationally on this there
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
are 18 other states that do this uh so
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh including some of the co-pays that
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
even Massachusetts puts in place so we
 
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
um you know we felt that this was done
 
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
kind of looking at other National models
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure we would do it in an
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate way uh that still made it
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
affordable for the individuals that of
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
course need this
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
Care thank you representative eel for a
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
and Happy Valentine's Day um I have a
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
question but I I want to start out by
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
saying how much um I appreciate the fact
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
that you put a moratorium on uh landfill
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh permitting for a year um I'm the
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
chair of the state Solid Waste working
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
group and I've worked very closely uh
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
with Dees and I look forward to
 
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
continuing the work with Dees and you to
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
retain our L landfill capacity and
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
reduce uh sources um I know it's a very
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
emotional subject for a lot of people um
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
my question and I know that you're very
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
um interested in in making sure that
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
every that Justice is done in the state
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire my division uh division
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
one we had an opportunity to meet for an
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
hour and a half with the judicial branch
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
and we talked uh quite a bit about their
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
budget um they did meet a target of 4%
 
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
decrease in their budget but the way
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
that they did it is
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
concerning um it does involve the
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
closure of two circuit cour houses one
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
in Candia and Claremont they're talking
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
about um eliminating jury trials two
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
months of the year in the superior court
 
00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
and they've talked about um having to
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
reduce security which in and of itself
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
may not seem like much but when you
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
don't have adequate security you can't
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
um run your courtrooms uh coupled with
 
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
all of that is the fact that virtually
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
all the YDC claims um they do have the
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
alternative uh route a settlement route
 
00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:05.559 align:start position:0%
um there they have these folks have also
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
um filed in Superior Court so they have
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
something like
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
1375 Superior Court claims so it's
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
really their Staffing is really affected
 
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
by that all in all um I think that it
 
00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
does affect the administration of
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
justice all these courts that is
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
Rippling out across the uh across the
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
state and I wondered if you could
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
comment on that yes thank you uh first
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
of all I have great respect for the
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
Judiciary having been uh a prosecutor
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
and appeared before every level of court
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
in this state uh many times uh but I
 
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
just respectfully disagree with them um
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of what they had proposed for
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
you um in those cuts when we we've asked
 
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
them to reduce which we did of many
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
agencies 4% and that 4% reduction was on
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
a histor historic high and I will have
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
James give you the exact numbers of how
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
much of a historic high it was coming
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
off the last bium and um the the idea
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
that they would propose eliminating jury
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
trials to me um when I would urge them
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary runs itself and so it's a
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
separate branch of government so I
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
certainly can't tell the Judiciary what
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
to look at but if I were in the
 
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
Judiciary there are two separate
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
administrative uh function F in within
 
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
like two separate complete
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
administrative functions for the circuit
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
courts and the superior court and they
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
haven't yet looked at can we share
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
functions uh do we need as much
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
administrative staff to have two
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
separate essentially administrative
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
functions rather than consolidating them
 
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
for one court system and seeing if they
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
could find savings there rather than
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
cutting jury trials uh coming off a
 
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
historic number so I'm very respect ful
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
of the Judiciary and I have great
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
respect for their work uh but I would
 
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
say I would ask the Judiciary to look at
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
how can we do this in a way coming off
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
of historical funding um when we're
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
asking only a 4% reduction to do so
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
without impacting the most important
 
00:46:17.549 --> 00:46:17.559 align:start position:0%
constitutional function uh jury trials
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
when it comes to our Judiciary and
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
giving people access to our court system
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
so I can have James fill you in on the
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
numbers because I looked at this very
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
closely because I care about the
 
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.390 align:start position:0%
closely because I care about the
Judiciary

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
um it it was a 4% reduction that that we
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
asked for and of course the judicial
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
branch maintains uh some autonomy from
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
from the executive branch so uh we don't
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
have the discretion with their budget
 
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
that we do on many of the executive
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
agencies that that we deal with just to
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
put their number in perspective a 4%
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
reduction off their adjusted authorized
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
would be $116 million a year in 2024
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
their actual spend was 105 million so
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're asking them to go from 105 million
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
to 116 million which is 4% less than
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
their adjusted authorized amount but
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's still a significant amount higher
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
than what they've been spending so um I
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
I think there are uh certainly ways to
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
get there without some of the
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
Draconian uh measures that they've
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
proposed you know I think those
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
obviously those
 
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh those cuts concern the governor as
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
well so uh we we look to working with
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
the legislature to and we hope to work
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
with the Judiciary but obviously they're
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
a separate branch and I respect that
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
they have to make their own
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
decisions represent McGuire for a
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.670 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
your

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
Excellency um revenues in the current
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal year have been disappointingly
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
below plan and um you are authorized to
 
00:47:56.559 --> 00:47:57.670 align:start position:0%
below plan and um you are authorized to
make

00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
Cuts right now um to help make the the
 
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
expenses meet income and therefore
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
avoiding using the revenue stabilization
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
fund this particular this budget has a
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
significant chunk taken from the revenue
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund do you think you
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
might be able to make some Cuts in the
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
ensuing months to to mitigate that uh
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
well representative McGuire it's you
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
know one of the reasons I put in place a
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze because we're scrutinizing
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
every position that's being hired
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
obviously with a waiver for Public
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
Safety we've got uh you know we actually
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
would save money if we could hire more
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers rather than paying
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
overtime and then obviously Troopers and
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
then if you're a child protection worker
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure you continue your
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
work if you're directly serving people
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
but in terms of managerial functions and
 
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
other jobs we're that's why I put that
 
00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:53.799 align:start position:0%
in place so that we can scrutinize and
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
then also as contracts come forward I
 
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
and spending comes forward at the
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
governor and council meeting we are
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
asking all of these questions of our
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
agencies can we do more with less is
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
this necessary even looking at things
 
00:49:09.789 --> 00:49:09.799 align:start position:0%
like um you know out ofate travel we've
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
talked to our commissioners about that
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
and really trying to save money there uh
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we've also looked at
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we all belong you know the
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
state belongs to a number of uh outside
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
organizations some of them are very
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
important for you know whether there's
 
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
certain organizations in the
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
transportation area we get but do we
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
need to belong to you know 15 versus you
 
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
know one or two of the most critical
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
ones so we're looking at at those areas
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
as well they're smaller areas of
 
00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:41.559 align:start position:0%
spending but they can make a big
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
difference so we're trying to look at
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
that and think about that because we
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
know that the current um even though I
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
propos to you a budget for the next bium
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
I know we've got to get through this
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
bium as well thank representative
 
00:49:55.119 --> 00:49:56.750 align:start position:0%
bium as well thank representative
Edwards

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
for taking my my question I I um two
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
topics came up co-pays for Medicaid and
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh onetime using onetime money for uh
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
operational expenses I I I I just wanted
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
to point out that in the the last term
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
we established the adult Dental Medicaid
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
Program and we used onetime money we
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
used cenen settlement money to to get
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
that going I view are doing that as a
 
00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
pilot project believing the theory that
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh Dental Care is good health care and
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
if we can get our Dental cases mitigated
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
early we can reduce money on over later
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
health care expenses related to Medicaid
 
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
that was the operational theory of that
 
00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
pilot Dr sarapin works for you and I I
 
00:50:58.109 --> 00:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
would just ask um um the executive you
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
know given that I'm already looking at
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
next budget that would have to become
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
operational money next budget so if we
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
could just be uh keep our eyes open on
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's a that's truly a
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
value added program I I think it is that
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
was the theory but uh have you heard of
 
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
it or looked at it at all the adult
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
Dental Medicaid Program uh
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
representative I will I'll meet with the
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
director now that I you know certainly
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
you've raised it and I understand the
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
connection between dental care and
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
medical care and some of the acute
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
medical conditions can be related to
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
dental areas so I understand why you
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
would uh obviously want to focus on that
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
so I will follow up uh with the director
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
directly so so I just wanted to also let
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
folks know that we we have precedent in
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
the state for doing um copay for
 
00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:52.839 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh we did that with the adult
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
Dental Medica Medicaid Program so it's
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
not completely something we have no
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
experience with it's something that we
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
are already
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
doing committee members we've reached
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
the a lot of time that the uh Governor
 
00:52:11.789 --> 00:52:11.799 align:start position:0%
has able to to give to us so I hope that
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm impressed with the fact that
 
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
she stayed here longer than most
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
Governors do and is C I didn't know any
 
00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:22.799 align:start position:0%

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate you being here
