00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
for hearings all day we're not planning
 
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
on executing anything next week but we
 
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
will have hearings all day the following
 
00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
week we're going to exact the bills that
 
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
we're hearing next week the following
 
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
week um then
 
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
reports our committee clerk tells us
 
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
that if we had a report today it has to
 
00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
be submitted by noon time or 1:00 I said
 
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
well we'll get out of here before that I
 
00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 align:start position:0%
think but I know it's tough for a lot of
 
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
new people to be writing reports because
 
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
they got to figure out how do they do
 
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
that and then it's got to go be reviewed
 
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
so what I would like to ask everyone is
 
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh and I mentioned this before the
 
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
Democrat reports send them to the leader
 
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
here Alison nap she'll review them and
 
00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
then send them to me so all the Democrat
 
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
reports send them to your leader she'll
 
00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
review them and send them to me um for
 
00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
grammar or whatever uh the Republic
 
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
reports come to me then I'll assemble
 
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
them then I send them to our committee
 
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
clerk then the committee clerk sends it
 
00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
to the the speaker's office and the
 
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
clerk's office um I would like to I'd
 
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
like to have them as soon as possible
 
00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 align:start position:0%
because yesterday we were told there's
 
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
not many bills on for next week but
 
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
there some more coming on today and
 
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday if I can have them at least by
 
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
Friday night that way way in between me
 
00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
running a deliberative session on
 
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
Saturday and going to a fire truck push
 
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
thing on Sunday I can review all these
 
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
reports so that I'm able to submit them
 
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
timely next week so that they get on the
 
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
following calendar so if you can get
 
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
them done in a couple hours great but
 
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking not and I don't want to
 
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
have a gun to your head I want to I want
 
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
nice reports and I want you the new guys
 
00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
to have time to figure out and ask
 
00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
questions you know and I'm available I
 
00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 align:start position:0%
know representative nap's available if
 
00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 align:start position:0%
you have questions about writing reports
 
00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
so try to get them in at least by Friday
 
00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 align:start position:0%
night do your best as soon as possible
 
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
because they'd like us to finish the
 
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
report so we can move them on we have 10
 
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
bills we're voting on today so the rule
 
00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
that I got was don't wait until you get
 
00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
all the 10 reports which might be 20
 
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
reports but as soon as you get enough
 
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
reports send them up but I am
 
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
anticipating we have a good committee
 
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get everybody's report by
 
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
Friday night we they're going to have 10
 
00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
on the agenda some might be consent some
 
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
might not be consent whatever but I'd
 
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
like to get these 10 out of here as of
 
00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday we still had like 21 bills
 
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
total so these are 10 today probably
 
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
going to do seven next week and I left
 
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
maybe five so that we can EXA those
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
seven the following week have time for
 
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
some hearings and I'm sure we're going
 
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
to get more bills so then I could fill
 
00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 align:start position:0%
in the hours with the more bills um I
 
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
had the committee clerk send out to
 
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
everybody the timing sheet when we have
 
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
to get these early bills out of here
 
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
some are March 3rd some are March 20th
 
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
I'm on a schedule that I hope we can all
 
00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 align:start position:0%
live with that if we keep doing the way
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
we've been doing we'll be done before
 
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
the end of February and if that's true
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
we won't need to have any hearings on
 
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
vacation week
 
00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 align:start position:0%
and um which would be nice that we
 
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
finish all the early bills right now
 
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
it's 21 but I haven't check today to see
 
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
if we picked up
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
anymore so that's just some housekeeping
 
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
things you I passed around my card
 
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
because it has my cell phone and my
 
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
regular email and some of you have been
 
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
sending me stuff to that it's easier for
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
me to respond to you guys if you send it
 
00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
to my personal email and call me on my
 
00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
cell at any time and I guess it takes a
 
00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
message if I don't pick it up so I can
 
00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
get back to you anybody have any
 
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 align:start position:0%

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 align:start position:0%

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
they're nowhere's near the road they're
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
all off-road there's no noise complaints
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
no dust complaints the only possible
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
other push back would be hunting and all
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
the trails around this 10 m approximate
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
10 mile area are are open for that extra
 
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
two weeks we're not looking for anything
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
longer than
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
that uh so so I don't see how that
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
should differentiate that 10 miles from
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
the rest of the trails where hunting
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
comes into play usually it doesn't get
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
real busy until after the leaves drop
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
which I believe is after Columbus Day so
 
00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:22.039 align:start position:0%
I think that's another moot
 
00:08:22.039 --> 00:08:23.629 align:start position:0%
I think that's another moot
point

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh trying to think of the other uh yeah
 
00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
so there's no no local complaining the
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
only thing is they're trying to get a
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
little more business we don't get the
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
snow we used to so Winters are a little
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
more harsh up there and this would kind
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
of offset
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative ghoul do
 
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to you a second anyone
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
else wish to speak on this bill
 
00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.269 align:start position:0%
else wish to speak on this bill
representative

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr and representative
 
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
Ryan um I have a couple of comments
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
briefly to make um first of course I
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
understand that this is important to the
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
town of Pittsburgh and I respect uh the
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
need to uh you know to generate Revenue
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
up in um up in Pittsburgh however I'm
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
concerned that this is um uh usurping um
 
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
local control uh there is a um there's
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
the um the local Citizens Council which
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
is responsible for making sure that
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
conservation easement is enforced um
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
they just uh worked with the uh dncr um
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
last May to um to create a Five-Year
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
Plan prior to that um during that
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
assessment there was no request for
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
extending the um season um they dncr
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
also said that they'd be happy to uh
 
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate this um if they were to receive
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
a request by April 1st so it's l it's
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
likely that no uh legislation is
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
required at all for this even uh
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
councelor Kennedy when he came when he
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
um uh questioned the um the the vote
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
against extending the season in 2024
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
asked for only a one-year extension as
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to a permanent
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
extension this this is uh there's a
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
conservation easement that um is uh that
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
basically um coordinates the the land
 
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
owner's rights with the state's rights
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
and make sure that uh local citizens are
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh voices are heard and this basically
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
is asking the legislature to go around
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
um that local control and I think it
 
00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:34.839 align:start position:0%
sets a bad precedent and it may even um
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
be in violation of the conservation
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
easement um New Hampshire fishing game
 
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
opposed it and um I heard from Hunters
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
who have been up there first they say
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
that um the the the three predominant
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
weeks that they do bird hunt are the
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
first three weeks um in October this
 
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
would effectively take away two of those
 
00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
they also use terms like um I've been up
 
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
there before for uh um while the the
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
trail was in use and it's like a
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
Speedway it's scary another person said
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't bring my dogs up there
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
like these are dogs that cost thousands
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
of dollars so um all in all I um I think
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
that this is um usurping control I don't
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
think that it's required legislation
 
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
because dncr um has said that they would
 
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
be receptive to discussing this next
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
year and um and I don't think the
 
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
legislature should be um should be
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
working on the process thank you
 
00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:33.110 align:start position:0%
working on the process thank you
representative

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
Ryan thank you Mr chair um as far as the
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm against this as far as the
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
tourism argument most of our tourists
 
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
don't come from where we live so um
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
people are going to come to hunt um that
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
and they're as far as I understand they
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
they probably rent rooms they um buy gas
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
and they eat and they probably drink
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
beer so they will be in our um
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
our hotels and motels and and grocery
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
stores and in that area um these dogs
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
are very very expensive they're a very
 
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
expensive hunting tool I can't um
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
picture them running around trying to
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
hunt with Motor Vehicles going through
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
and the noise alone would um definitely
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
deter any birds that I might be hunting
 
00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:28.839 align:start position:0%
I am not a hunter but I have talked to a
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
lot of people up there and it is it is a
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
very short bird hunting season so if
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to address it as a tourism
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
industry or tourism issue um we're
 
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
essentially going to shut them out and
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
as far as recreation resources and
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
development I don't believe all of our
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
Recreation should rely on motorized
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles thank
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
Vale thank you Mr chair um
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
I was listening to representative
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
Darby's testimony about The Five-Year
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
Plan and um I Echo that as well that's
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
one of my the reasons I am opposed to
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
the bill and also we have a commission
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
resources has a commission and we are
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
coming in with a new term with a lot of
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
people that don't have the
 
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
expertise and would need opportunity to
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
have access to that now now
 
00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they don't meet again
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
until March um but if we were to
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
overlook the commission then I think we
 
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
are at serious risk of overlooking the
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
non-legislative solutions that
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative Darby was talking about
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for um recognizing me anyone
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
11 to five yes okay so since we agree
 
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to ask him to recall it
 
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
again so 11 to five so won't go on
 
00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
consent representative Derby wants to
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
ask for that I don't know okay and it
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
has a fiscal note so it'll go to finance
 
00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
or one of those places um the next one
 
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
hb1 174 increasing the maximum weight of
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
a utility terrain vehicle to 3500 lb
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
unladen dry weight representative Davis
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
do you have a
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair I I would make
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
a motion not to pass thank you
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
representative dund second in a second
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to your motion
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
representative Davis yes please thank
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
you U I believe this this bill was put
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
in place to pave the way for electric
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
ohvs the batteries are heavier uh that
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
would solve some of the the complaints
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
right now uh pertaining to
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
noise uh I also believe that a lot of
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
the vehicles out there with the
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
accessories uh like a four up with four
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
Riders are probably overweight maybe
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
even some of the law enforcement
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles and I don't see anybody
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
enforcing it now if if we already have
 
00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles overweight there's no nobody
 
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
out there forcing it I I don't I see it
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
as a moot point Thank you thank you
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative Dunn
 
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959 align:start position:0%
did you want to speak to your second
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that this is Paving the
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
way for the electric vehicles with the
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
heavier batteries be less noise it be
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
better for everyone's complaints about
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
the noise thank you anyone else wish to
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
speak on this representative Vale I had
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
concerns about the use of the word
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
unladen and um what I've come to
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
understand is that that's basically the
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle is stripped and
 
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
so still learning about the newer bigger
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles I'm not thinking of electric
 
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
right now I'm more or less thinking of
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
um a six-seater that has air
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
conditioning and windows that roll
 
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:52.039 align:start position:0%
up thank you representative NAB thank
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I think this is a bill
 
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about the 1188 commission
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's really suited for that commission
 
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
I know we have an official PLL from them
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
um but I think there are a lot of
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions here representative
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
veale indicated one the UNL dry weight
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
which is not def at all um you know I
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
think making a decision about a bill
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
just because you don't have enforcement
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
isn't a reason to do something um it's a
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
reason to consider how things are
 
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:18.039 align:start position:0%
enforced um I think the electric vehicle
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
comment is you know we don't really know
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
where that's going we don't know how
 
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
much usage there is um there's a lot of
 
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
times in this house a lot of distrust of
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles so having that be the
 
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
reason to pass this is um is is
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
something I think we need to consider
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
and lastly um I think there's a real
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence here you know I
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
know this applies to state property or
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
just to P public lands um but we saw
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
concerns from private land owners the uh
 
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
the Farm Bureau and the Timberlands
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
Association and you know a lot of times
 
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
when you allow these things to start
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
happening you lose the rights you have
 
00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
so you're going to have these private
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
land owners who allow these vehicles um
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
change their mind on that and I don't
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
think anyone wants that direction so for
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
that reason I am not going to support
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
you representative Derby thank you Mr
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
chair um I I don't want to repeat what
 
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
my colleagues have said I do want to let
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
you uh let the committee know that a
 
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
good friend of mine um has a side by
 
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:18.919 align:start position:0%
side I asked him how much his weighed it
 
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
was 1998 and he was proud that he had
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
been able to squeeze it under the limit
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
but really was looking forward to um
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
being able to actually put a heater in
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
his he brings his whole family up uh for
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
frequently and so I very much uh believe
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
that there's a there will be a need to
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
increase the uh the weights of um
 
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
ohvs um as my colleague uh said you know
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
um Timberland Owners Association Farm
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau as well as the National Wildlife
 
00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:48.039 align:start position:0%
Federation all came out in opposition
 
00:19:50.909 --> 00:19:50.919 align:start position:0%
one of the real reasons is that the Bild
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
does um 90% of up to 90% of the trails
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
are on public land private land this
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh discuss uh how to address uh
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
how to coordinate with those property
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
owners and and in particular the
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
easements that are already exist
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
existing and how people that are um
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
driving these uh larger Vehicles will
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
know um that H oh uh this section the
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
public section is
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
3500b but the next section is only 2,000
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
so there there are I think a number of
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions that um that the
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
the um 1188 study uh commission um could
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
help to resolve finally um I the the
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
jury is definitely out with respect to
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
um unlaid and dry weight and electric
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
vehicles there are definitely some um
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
some definitions where batteries which
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
are the largest weight are not included
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
in that weight so I don't think that
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
using that as a um as justification is
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
warranted at this point um and for those
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
reasons I'll be opposing it thank you
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%

00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
you moving on executing HB 203 203
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
relative to ccot approved personal
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
flotation devices while on New Hampshire
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
state waters 203 I recognize uh
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative donelly for a motion
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to make the
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
motion to
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
itl and representative
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
Dupont second so we have motion and a
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
second representative Donell you want to
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
um this is I think well intentioned
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of positives that people
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
would like to um uh go down this
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
particular path but I think as a New
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident we have uh many of
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
our existing laws where we have no
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
helmet we have no Mand Mand mandated hel
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
mandated uh seat Bel um and when we
 
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
start making mandates I think we start
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
to go down a slippery slope um and we
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
believe in personal resp
 
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um and people having
 
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
life jackets with them in their in their
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
their crafts at the time whether it's
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
you know winter or summer um they should
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
have uh a a life jacket this would um
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
change the law sometime you know mid
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
year and then people have to remember
 
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
what what month is it do I have to do it
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
this time I think this could create a
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
confusion and I think uh a better
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
education process would be better than
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you thank you
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative Dupont do you want to
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
speak to you a second I just said to
 
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
live by our model Live Free or
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
Die thank you is there anyone else that
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
we wishes to speak on this
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
bill representative Derby thank you Mr
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
chair just briefly um this was supported
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
by the department of safety this is a
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
safety Bill and in in particular it
 
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
helps with education I think education
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
of course is the key um and uh very
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
rarely I would expect the department of
 
00:23:59.710 --> 00:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
safety to actually enforce penalties on
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
this but it helps them to you know um
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
stop people on the lake and say you know
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
this is the law we'll give a warning
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
this time and talk to them about cold
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
water emergence um and we saw we got a
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
report from the Department of Safety
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
that show that people die um every year
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
from um uh almost exclusively because
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have life jackets on um and
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
so this this likely would save um lives
 
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons I will be uh voting
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
against the it thank you thank you
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
Vale thank you Mr
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
chair I will be voting against the itl
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
and I just just quickly want to just
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
probably we don't always think about
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
what search and rescue um comes to for
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety for Marine
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
Patrol and we also know that we don't
 
00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:59.870 align:start position:0%
Patrol and we also know that we don't
have

00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
an army to go help when there is an
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
incident on the lake it often requires
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
the cordination of a lot of volunteers
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
as well as the department of safety and
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol and yearly we do hear
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
about a number of drowning deaths and
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
this period time period is during the
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
most difficult and most
 
00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
challenging um weather that our state
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
faces and um I do believe that this
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
would save lives thank you anyone else
 
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.909 align:start position:0%
would save lives thank you anyone else
representative

00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
Davis I'd have to say I agree with
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative Darby education is key
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
here uh 12 children 12 and Ender are
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
mandated to wear these devices and and
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
you are mandated to have one with you um
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that a representative
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
Donnelly said we are the live free and
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
die State and we're not mandated to wear
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
seat belts or motorcycle helmets I I
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
think this uh will align with that uh
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
you you still have to have it with you
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
you're just not mandated to have it on
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
you so that's I'll be voting out to

representative Dupont I call on you for
 
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
a motion yes Mr chairman I move that we

Donnelly I second this so we have a
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
motion in a second representative D Pont
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion yeah
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%

00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
layer of
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
government uh
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
intrusion um House Bill 1250 failed
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%

to your second um I would second th
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
those same sentiments in addition I
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
think it creates an exclusion type of
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
environment within communities um which
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't always Encompass the entire
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
community's um Mo U uh use of the the
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
particular lake or Pond within that
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
Community thank you anyone else wish to
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
speak on

this we'll go back to you Mr
 
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.470 align:start position:0%
this we'll go back to you Mr
representative

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
Vil thank you Mr chair I'm looking at
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
some testimony that was submitted
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
through the portal where we have the
 
00:28:33.159 --> 00:28:34.230 align:start position:0%
through the portal where we have the
remote

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
remote
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
testimony and um allowing the
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
establishment of this Village District
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
would not result in a form of
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
water-based activities from being banned
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
or even regulated on a lake or Pond and
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
it will though give cities and towns the
 
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
ability to control pollutants such as
 
00:28:54.679 --> 00:28:56.230 align:start position:0%
ability to control pollutants such as
cyanobacteria

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
eoli and fos fate from entering the
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
lakes and ponds it will allow our
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
communities to develop the ability to
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
work together and protect the natural
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
resources that we have and that people
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
come to depend on when they come here to
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%

the maker but we'll come back to you uh
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman uh as a resident
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
of a town with waterfront on lake sopy
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
and the representative of a second town
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
with waterfront on Lake sopy uh I know
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
that people in our towns are huge
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
supporters of this idea so that sunap uh
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
Newberry New London uh Springfield uh
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
can get together and address uh
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
contaminants uh going into one of our
 
00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
prized Waters uh the e economic effect
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
of a contaminated Lake would be severe
 
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
um and that is the purpose of this is to
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
allow uh these towns and similar towns
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
around Lake babusek and other Lakes uh
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
to address those things and to prevent
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
economic harm uh to our state so I would
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
uh um I'm going to uh oppose the motion
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
to itl and would prefer a motion to pass
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that representative
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair um you know I think
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's just important to remember that
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
this is enabling legislation it's not
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
creating Village districts it's allowing
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
towns to create a village district for
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
this purpose um you know in my
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
experience with Town meetings the bar is
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
high to pass things like this so um it's
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
not being pushed on anyone who doesn't
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
have a who have a the opportunity to
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
oppose it we only heard one person that
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
was a resident of a village District
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
that did oppose it um they're already
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
place for many many other reasons so I
 
00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:02.919 align:start position:0%
don't you know I I understand the
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
concerns about Village districts but
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
this doesn't create Village districts it
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
just enables the creation of them by
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
towns that are really desperately trying
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
to fight these issues with contaminants
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
in their Lakes thank
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair I will be brief um
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
and not repeat what others have said
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
about the number of uh existing reasons
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
that um that these can be created for or
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that um village districts have
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
been um in uh law for over 100 years
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
I'll just point out a couple of facts
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
about Village districts first all the
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
vote voters in the towns that Village
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
districts are applicable to have to
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
approve them in each Town once the uh
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
district is
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
it's the district voters that get to um
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
would approve taxes so basically it
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
allows people to um that are affected by
 
00:32:09.789 --> 00:32:09.799 align:start position:0%
the water quality to say hm we want to
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
improve the water quality and if they
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to they won't get taxed and
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
of course they can um uh remove
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
themselves they can vote to remove
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
themselves from the village District at
 
00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:20.549 align:start position:0%
themselves from the village District at
any

00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
time um this there were some concerns
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
that the um waters are State regulated
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and that um uh and that there would
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
be some type of access uh restrictions
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
um but this uh the amendment that uh um
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh I sent out yesterday will uh attempts
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
to address those by restricting the um
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh the controls that the village
 
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
District can apply um to uh to Protec
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
and and remediating surface water water
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
quality so I um will be voting against
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%

to you Mo yeah I'll say a couple things

um the new language I believe is not
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
necessary uh the way it is currently
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
written is is is fine and a cost of
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
$500,000 to $1 million is just not
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
affordable in this economy it's not
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
something that that we can sustain it's
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
something that we're trying
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
to make a budget balanced and cut it and
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's not something we can afford at this
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%

bill representative
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair only because I
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
didn't hear any other opposing views um
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
I'll just remind um the committee of uh
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
my briefly of my testimony that um New
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire really uh is driven by its
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
outdoor tourism economy um and
 
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
protecting um planning for and
 
00:35:58.109 --> 00:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
protecting the environment is critical
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
to um keeping an um an environment that
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
tourists want to come to also that um on
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
many occasions um mtbe P um the uh
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services has
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
had to be reactionary because we
 
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't uh predict some of these
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
threats leading to um you know Health
 
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
impacts to our uh citizens um as well as
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know lots of costs to the state and
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
to the residents so um for those reasons
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
think that adding uh environmental um
 
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
recognition into the state development
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
plan um is important and I will be
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
opposing the ideal thank
 
00:36:40.309 --> 00:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
you anyone else representative NAB thank
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I just think you know
 
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
things have changed probably since this
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
was enacted I don't know when that was
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
but um you know drinking water is not a
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
guarantee anymore and this people talk a
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
lot about how many straws you can put in
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
the ground you know I think this idea of
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
identifying aquifers and understanding
 
00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
our Water Resources is incredible
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
important they're not unlimited they're
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
not always clean um and not having this
 
00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
part of our plan I think is a real a
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
really shortsighted approach I also came
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
out of the environment and agriculture
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
committee with representative Davis
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
where we spent a lot of time talking
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
about landfills um and I think in you
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
know being sure to consider our waste as
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
part of our comprehensive state plan is
 
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
really important you know waste causes a
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
lot of problems in this state but we
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
have it and um and it's important to
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
address so I do support passing this
 
00:37:28.109 --> 00:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:29.190 align:start position:0%

chair first I'll just briefly describe
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
the difference um in this amendment um
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
from the original bill um in um the the
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
peric paragraph 4 um originally it was
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
the first section of that no person
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
shall use spuds dot dot dot through
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
requiring a more artment this amendment
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
adds the um the last uh sentence in that
 
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
first par in that paragraph
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other provision of
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
the law and the three sub Clauses those
 
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
three sub Clauses were issues that were
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
um discussed and and concerns that were
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
raised um during testimony and um
 
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
through the help of uh some of our some
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
of our friends uh they were able to um
 
00:40:34.109 --> 00:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
work through um those concerns and find
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
language that um the the stakeholders um
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
could agree with um and so there
 
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
therefore I'd like to propose this
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to uh find a bill that uh find
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
a version of the bill that we can all
 
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.190 align:start position:0%
a version of the bill that we can all
agree

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:48.200 align:start position:0%

00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%

representative Bridal second so we have
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
a motion in a second do you wish to
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you Mr
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
chair um as we heard from testimony from
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
Dees that this particular um violations
 
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
and penalties they have not actually
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
pursued any violations or penalties for
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years so they have one
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
currently in in that particular area um
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
I'm all for helping give people like the
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
guidance and helping them understand
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
this is not what you should be doing on
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
shorelines I actually live on a a lake
 
00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:00.270 align:start position:0%
shorelines I actually live on a a lake
as

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
well by creating more of a penalty when
 
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
they don't even penalize yet let's see
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
how this goes let's see how because we
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
passed a law last year that allows them
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
to actually enact the penalty for 5,000
 
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering and we should see first
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
how does that affect our residents that
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
are building new Properties or making
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
modifications or adjusting any of their
 
00:44:29.549 --> 00:44:29.559 align:start position:0%
Shoreline um I'm more and the mindset of
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that we're not overdoing
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
something when we don't even have the
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
numbers yet to say this is going to make
 
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
a difference um in this particular bill
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that thank you thank you
 
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh lawn put in um all in violation when
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
the uh when the um owner was asked why
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
did you do this or um didn't you have to
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
pay a fine and he got the $10,000 uh
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
fine um from the town um he which means
 
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
that he had done it more than once um he
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
said that's the cost of doing business
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
so I've seen that firsthand you there
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
does need to be teeth um in the
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
penalties otherwise it's just uh it's
 
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
just an expense to them so I will be um
 
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:00.559 align:start position:0%
supporting the uh um uh voting against
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
the itl to support New Hampshire
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
Services anyone
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
Vale thank you Mr chair um over time we
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
have heard quite a bit about Shoreland
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
septic and about violations of the water
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
quality protection act but we've also
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
heard that Dees has had difficulty in
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
enforcing some of the provisions that
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
need to be enforced and I do believe
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
that I'll be voting against the itl on
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
the basis of a
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
longterm accumulation of
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
um facts that starts with the Shoreland
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
septic commission that um former

representatives from the committee
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
worked on so I'm just looking at this
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm thinking that we haven't
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
really established um
 
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
um that we don't need this bill I do
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.270 align:start position:0%
motion okay representative NAB thank you
Mr

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
chair so I think we heard in the
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
introduction of this bill that it was
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
trying to solve a problem and it's a
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned bill um to address an
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
issue with the water district
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think that we heard also
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
heard during the testimony that it would
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
create really more problems than it was
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
trying to solve um it would uh it would
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
require the installation of water
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
filtration systems to residential
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
customers um however after the
 
00:49:09.069 --> 00:49:09.079 align:start position:0%
installation it would not require the
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
water district to maintain those at all
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
so you would run into a problem of
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
individuals and in this case 300 indiv
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
individuals having to maintain them
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
change the filters take care of them
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that they were running um and
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we heard that was
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
very alarming is that those people who
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
are not maintaining it can create a
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
build up of contaminants and even
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
radioactive elements into the system
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
that can go back into the system so um
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
that is a huge problem with it and you
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
know it's people are well intentioned
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
but it's hard to take care of things
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
it's um uh creates more work for the
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
individual residents in the long term um
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
more significantly we also heard it
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of the federal
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
drinking water act so um it's really a
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
problematic bill that uh that doesn't
 
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
exactly work as a solution so I would
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
recommend it Ling it thank you thank you
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
