excuse me it's uh
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
i bring this up bill 1160 relative to
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
obedience to signals at railroad
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
crossings i bring this on behalf of the
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
mainly the
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
their work in the state the brotherhood
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
and maintenance of way
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
the equipment
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
that is used today to maintain
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
tracks and stuff like that is quite
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
large my background came from
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
firefighting i was a deputy chief in the
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
city of nashua and even though
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
firefighting is one of the listed as one
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
of the more hazardous type of jobs that
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
people work does not mean that we ignore
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
safety you know we try to do everything
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
within our power to increase the safety
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
and this is what clearly is the
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
if we look at it it basically just say
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh everybody seems to agree that if a
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
train is approaching a crossing or
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
something like that to yield to the
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
train those of us that do have any spots
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
where the would act accordingly
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
but what about the workers that go to
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
maintain and again like i stated before
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
that some of this equipment is
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
relatively large
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
so this will accept uh will make it more
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
safe for the maintenance people who are
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
take care of our tracks
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
now in looking at what we brought up
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
this bill uh
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
you know the road perdition is always
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
not paved in gold but
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
in looking at this and discussing with
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
other concerns of other
 
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.710 align:start position:0%
other concerns of other
stakeholders

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
let's take a look at line three of the
 
00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:46.230 align:start position:0%
let's take a look at line three of the
bill

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
this is the first mentioned other
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
on-track equipment and that includes
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
that the apparatus that the railroad
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
workers would be using
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
and as you know recreational within the
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire such as up in
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
laconia for example they do have those
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
little push cuts and stuff like that and
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
clearly this bill is not intended to
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
cover those particular
 
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.110 align:start position:0%
cover those particular
vehicles

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
i will offer to write or if the
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
committee would like to write an
 
00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:19.750 align:start position:0%
committee would like to write an
amendment

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i think i have somebody who might
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
volunteer to assist with that
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative teleski if she shall
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
see fit
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
is basically just put in
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the example of line three it would
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
read would be maintenance of way so line
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
three would be obedient obedience to
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
signal indicating approach of a train or
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
other maintenance of way on track
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
equipment and that would clearly
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
designate what the bill uh intends to do
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
is to uh
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
protect the railroad workers that are
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
you know doing the track and that's it
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i of course be open for
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
questions but also with me
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
and to present this bill
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
if you should call would like to call is
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:16.389 align:start position:0%

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative gorski
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative for your testimony quick
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
question um in terms of these
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance of vehicles you mentioned
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
they were large i mean how large are
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
they the size of a box car can you give
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
us some indication of that well that's
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
interesting and i not to be repetitive i
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
think you will hear in later testimony
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
but i was surprised this morning that
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
some of them are way more than an empty
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
box cop but i'll let the experts uh
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and then that's
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
part of the concern of safety with this
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
further questions representative o'hara
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative so when you step in
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
laconia you're talking about the push
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
carts you're talking about the pedal
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
bikes too this wouldn't be covered under
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
that that's correct i mean the
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
intentions the sole intention of this
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
bill is the protector uh to protect the
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
railroad workers nothing to do with the
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
recreational end of it you know
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
that track i think could be further
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
explained by uh representative
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
d.o.t that is here if they wish to
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
testify but basically that's uh
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
the state regulates that this is mostly
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
just for the workers within the railroad
 
00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:29.749 align:start position:0%
just for the workers within the railroad
industry

00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%

you representative brian for taking the
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
question on these um on-track
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance vehicles if you will
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
do they set off the signal on crossings
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
where there are
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
you know signal indicators and gates do
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
they they will trip them the same way a
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
train would
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%

uh that's a good question but i'm not of
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
expertise i think uh mr gordon if
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to testify could clearly explain
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
if that trips that uh safety device

265.48 to include maintenance of way
equipment

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
under the current new hampshire law
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
maintenance of way railroad contractors
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
and other on-track equipment are not
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
included in the prohibition concerning a
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
motorist's responsibility when
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
approaching the crossing
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
it is critically important that when the
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
gates go down or when that there are
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
train approaching or a flagment or a
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
stop sign exec
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
present the motor vehicle will stop a
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
safe distance from the crossing
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 1160 would update existing
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
railroad crossing laws pertaining to
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
motorist responsibility at railroad
 
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.390 align:start position:0%
motorist responsibility at railroad
crossings

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
crossings
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
currently maintenance of way
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
railroad contractors and other on-track
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
equipment are not included in the state
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
statute that mandates motorist
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
responsibility when approaching a
 
00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:59.430 align:start position:0%
responsibility when approaching a
crossing

00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
crossing
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
the issue is on track maintenance
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
equipment has evolved into train-like
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
machines that present the same dangers
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
of a train slash engine with cars not
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
being able to stop on a dime
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
through modernization of railroad track
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
equipment our members now operate
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art equipment on tracks in
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
with that comes size we are long gone
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
from the days when push carts ran up and
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
while most public understands trains
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
occupy the tracks in their respective
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and to avoid them at all
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
costs not everybody is aware of the
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
on-track equipment and construction
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
machines that travel on track
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in new hampshire and and
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
this is a true safety bill that would
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
help protect new hampshire motorists and
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
our members that work and live in new
 
00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:48.470 align:start position:0%
our members that work and live in new
hampshire

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
similar legislation has already been
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
passed in over 34 states including
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
alabama arkansas california colorado

illinois
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
and others and there is currently active
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
or pending legislation in eight states
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
the legislation is supported by rail
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
labor and the railroads themselves
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
railroad contractors and in fact i have
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
no found no public opposition
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
it will help to clarify that
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
there are other pieces of equipment that
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
travel on the tracks
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
that present the same dangers to
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
motorists as trains
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
also we like to help the educate the
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
public on this fact after the state
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
statute is amended
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
working with the new hampshire operation
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
lifesaver and railroads look listen and
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
live psa programs
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
representative erosion i think it's a
 
00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:44.390 align:start position:0%
representative erosion i think it's a
follow-up

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr gordon
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
for taking the question it's a follow-up
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
to what i asked representative regard to
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not this equipment will trip
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
off the signal and gate and um and
 
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
another piece of that is are these lit
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
and have loud horns or whistles like a
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
train does to um
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
so their presence is is known in another
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
way that's kind of the question
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay so according to our operating rule
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
um that we use all of our on-track
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
equipment has to have lights
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh forward and back flashing lights or
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
strobes horns
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
and all the other appropriate audible
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
safety devices
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
and some of the equipment if it's
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
designed to will set off the signals
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
reliably and then we have equipment that
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
we insulate purposely to not set off the
 
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.870 align:start position:0%
we insulate purposely to not set off the
signals

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
signals
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
representative gorsky thank you mr
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
chairman this is a follow-up and thank
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
you mr gordon for taking my my question
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
um he mentioned the representative
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned the side he's a big size
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
equipment and you kind of mentioned
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
they're like train-like machines can you
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
give us a sense of the size
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
of some of these maintenance of way
 
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.830 align:start position:0%
of some of these maintenance of way
equipment

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
yes so we have um a crew what's called a
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
surface crew and their job is to line
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
and level the tracks
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
the lightest machine in that is called a
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
ballast regulator and it averages about
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
50 000 pounds
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
the heavier end of the machines
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
is called a vibrating stabilizer
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
and those average between 96 and 100 000
 
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.669 align:start position:0%
and those average between 96 and 100 000
pounds

00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
pounds
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%

00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
uh the major part of the bill this
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
changes and i do understand both sides
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
of this issue
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
is it changes uh
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
notification to first-class mail uh if
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
if you are
 
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.630 align:start position:0%
if you are
considered

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
being a habitual offender
 
00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:09.510 align:start position:0%
being a habitual offender
um

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
instead of me getting into the details
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
of it again i introduced this for a
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
courtesy i know there are people on both
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
sides of this issue behind me that can
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
do a much better job explaining the
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
issue it's not the first time we've seen
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
this here
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
but after having a meeting with
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
department of safety i figured it was
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
worth having us talk about it one more
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
time so
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
next up we have
 
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.190 align:start position:0%
next up we have
paul

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%

good morning in
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
opposition oh sorry about that
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm paul halverson i'm your
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
merrimack county attorney
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm here to oppose the bill as
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's currently written
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh i want to give a little background uh
 
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.390 align:start position:0%
uh i want to give a little background uh
to

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
the ho statute
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
and compare it to some difficulties that
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
were encountered
 
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.510 align:start position:0%
were encountered
when

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
with an operating after suspension
 
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.029 align:start position:0%
with an operating after suspension
statute

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
mental state changed to knowingly
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
the original declaration of policy that
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature put out and it's
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
outlined in the habitual offender
 
00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:30.630 align:start position:0%
outlined in the habitual offender
statute

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.750 align:start position:0%
statute

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
providing maximum safety for all persons
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
who travel or otherwise use the ways of
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
and to deny the privilege of driving
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles to persons who utter
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
conduct have demonstrated their
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
indifference for the safety and welfare
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
of others and of disrespect for the laws
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the state the orders of the court and
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
the acts of administrative agencies and
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
that's under rsa 262-18
 
00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:56.149 align:start position:0%
that's under rsa 262-18
and

00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:01.029 align:start position:0%
back in
1991

00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
1991
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
the court
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
by a
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
by a case and i'll reference it by name
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
put a mental state of knowingly onto the
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
offense of operating a vehicle after
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
being certified as a habitual offender
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
the mental state knowingly is very
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
important because it requires notice to
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
several years ago the court did a
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
similar action
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
with the operating after suspension
 
00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:31.830 align:start position:0%
with the operating after suspension
statute

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that the oas statute
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
was very difficult to prosecute after
 
00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:36.789 align:start position:0%
was very difficult to prosecute after
the

00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh legislate i'm sorry after the courts
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
issued their orders saying that it
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
requires a knowingly mental state
 
00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:44.149 align:start position:0%
requires a knowingly mental state
uh

00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:44.159 --> 00:27:45.269 align:start position:0%
uh
absent

00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
absent
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
a in-hand notice
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh there was it's very difficult to show
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
that someone knew about their status
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
when their license was suspended the
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
same applies to habitual offender status
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
there were many many cases
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
of operating after suspension that could
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
not go forward
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
should this
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
change to allow by male
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
notice to the individuals go into effect
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
the same issual crop up and prosecution
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
of both misdemeanors and felony habitual
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
offender issues
 
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.470 align:start position:0%
offender issues
the

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.830 align:start position:0%
the
the

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
the impact of this as it's written
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
would be to allow for an individual who
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
has a bad record who is somewhat
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
responsible who goes to his hearings and
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
gets certified as an ho and later drives
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
to actually be held more accountable
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
than the individual who blows off his
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
hearing says he didn't get notice drives
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
and is caught afterwards
 
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that as a matter of public
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
policy sends a bad message
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
i've talked to several other county
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
attorneys in recent days
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
the ones that i spoke to and exchanged
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
email with
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
agree with my analysis
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
there are two other
 
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.190 align:start position:0%
there are two other
local

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in uh franklin allenstown
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
who emailed me the this morning
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
indicating they had the same concern
 
00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:09.590 align:start position:0%
indicating they had the same concern
for

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
um for this uh happening in the local
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
courts for a misdemeanor habitual
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
offender uh if this law is enacted as
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's written
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not going to comment as to
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
amendments could make the law work
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
beyond saying
 
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.470 align:start position:0%
beyond saying
that

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
the issue is one of
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
of notice
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
what address do they use to send notice
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
it's not outlined in a statute is it
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
sent by registered mail what happens if
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
they deny
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
service of the registered mail what
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
happens if they don't keep their address
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
updated on motor vehicle records as
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
required by by statute
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
all of that factors into whether or not
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
the person has actual notice of their
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
status as a mutual offender and will
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
affect the prosecution
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the opposition in a nutshell
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
it would be very difficult to prosecute
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
these cases should this go into effect
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
as as written i'll gladly entertain any
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone may have
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair thank
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question sorry i'll
 
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.269 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question sorry i'll
stretch

00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
stretch
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
um just can you please clarify just so i
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
completely understand how the process is
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
done now it's physically someone handing
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
an offender an envelope
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that when the person
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
is certified at their certification
 
00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:29.510 align:start position:0%
is certified at their certification
hearing

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
the notification to them is at that
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
hearing the minute they're certified
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're notified of it um
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
if mr caskel behind me testifies he can
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
elaborate more on the current process
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's an administrative process that
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
that i'm not deeply involved in but my
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
understanding is that as of right now
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
they are informed the minute the hearing
 
00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.750 align:start position:0%
they are informed the minute the hearing
examiner

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
examiner
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
issues their
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
their decision
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
at the hearing they're they're given
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
notice right then and there i believe
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
the orders read to them there too
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up sure is there anything
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass that would
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
prevent that same
 
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.830 align:start position:0%
prevent that same
procedure

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
well i think
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
in part yes
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
if the bill passes as it's written if a
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
person doesn't appear
 
00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:21.350 align:start position:0%
person doesn't appear
the

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
then they would be they would be
 
00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:25.350 align:start position:0%
then they would be they would be
certified

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
without their appearance and if they're
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
certified without their appearance the
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
issue becomes one of knowledge if they
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
later drive they may receive notice for
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
a hearing and notice to come to a
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
hearing but they would not be informed
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the of this of the suspension to date
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
the suspension goes into effect uh
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
they'd miss their their opportunity for
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
for a due process hearing
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
and if it goes out by first class mail
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
the notice of the hearing the question
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
becomes did they actually receive that
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
notice that's what it all boils down to
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
notice to the individual i can say that
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
i i guess i will address
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
a possible way of fixing this uh within
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
the bill if there was some sort of
 
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.190 align:start position:0%
the bill if there was some sort of
follow-on

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
follow-on
 
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.149 align:start position:0%
follow-on
um

00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
in-hand notice if they fail to appear at
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
their certification hearing uh that
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
could be a fix but but that is a minor
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
uh one of the
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
one of the several fixes uh that would
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
need to happen in my opinion
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
to make the bill workable uh the address
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
issue which addresses it sent to would
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
have to be fleshed out
 
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.350 align:start position:0%
have to be fleshed out
and

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not the suspension would go
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
into effect prior to their notice as a
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
habitual offender
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
much like dwi statute if an individual
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
conviction on a dwi the license loss
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
goes into effect
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
even if they appeal their their
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
their dwi for example a dwi
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
second offense that has a mandatory jail
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
sentence they can appeal their dwi but
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
under statute the license law still goes
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
in into effect
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
i think something like that here would
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate but as i said i
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
don't think as written you can
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
incorporate those type of changes easily
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
within this statute as it's currently
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
written thank
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
you perhaps gorski did you have a
 
00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:12.310 align:start position:0%
you perhaps gorski did you have a
question

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
i was already answered for the question
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question yes sir um
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
do i understand you right that that um
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
you think this is a solution in search
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
of a problem or
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
um is this also something that you could
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
discuss with the director
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh directly and and talk about uh
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
possible solutions if there is a problem
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
frankly i don't know what brought rise
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh i was not proven to the conversations
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
that brought rise to to recommend to the
 
00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:48.389 align:start position:0%
that brought rise to to recommend to the
proposed

00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
legislation um if there's a cost-saving
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
measure to be gained by the department
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
of safety i fully understand that
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
but that becomes a public policy issue
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
for the legislative bodies to make a
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
determination on whether or not they
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
want to accept
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
the added cost for department of safety
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
to have notice to individuals
 
00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:10.389 align:start position:0%
to have notice to individuals
and

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:11.270 align:start position:0%
and
or

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
eliminate some of the cost and risk a
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
basically in my opinion
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
going against the public the stated
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
public policy that's within the habitual
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
offender statute then that's a
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
legislative choice and i'm not gonna i'm
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
not gonna comment about that
 
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.430 align:start position:0%
not gonna comment about that
sure

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
um do you think it would be possible for
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh the county attorneys to
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
group together and and maybe make a
 
00:34:35.599 --> 00:34:37.669 align:start position:0%
group together and and maybe make a
recommendation

00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
i could ask the
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
the the the county attorney group but
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
we're kind of reluctant my opinion i'm
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
reluctant to recommend
 
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.389 align:start position:0%
reluctant to recommend
um

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation wording to to the
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
legislative body i think there's a
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
separation of powers issued error my
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
personal opinion i don't think we should
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
get into the writing we can certainly
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
comment on on on on items such as i'm
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
doing now the impact of items but i
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
don't think my opinion i don't think i
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
should be involved in in
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
proposed a wording of a of a statute
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
beyond saying what i think may help
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
um like in my question a moment ago
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
beyond that i don't think
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
i would be involved other county
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
attorneys i can ask the question though
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%

offender certification hearings and this
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
we've done two lean process events
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
looking from start to finish at the
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
process and trying to find ways to make
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
it better
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
really the primary motivation for this
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
as i see it is to expedite the process
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
so that high risk drivers are removed
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
from the roadways more quickly
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
and to go way back into the history of
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
this at one time the superior courts
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
did the habitual offender certification
 
00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:51.990 align:start position:0%
did the habitual offender certification
hearings

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
that then was transitioned to come under
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and give the
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
director of motor vehicles the authority
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
to do the complete process from the time
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
someone qualifies as an habitual
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
offender up through the entire hearing
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
process and it's a requirement under our
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
that the order to appear
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
which is the hearing notice with a
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
certified copy of the driving record
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
must be served in hands
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
on the habitual offender
 
00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:24.310 align:start position:0%
on the habitual offender
subject

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
by a law enforcement officer so it's
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
been done by state police for a long
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
time so to start the hearing process in
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
terms of the notice to the individual
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
that must be served in hand by state
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
police so that process
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
becomes lengthy
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
and at one of the
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
the lean events there was a power point
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
and there were a couple of different
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
ways the procedure was
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
described through different boxes and
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
steps in the process in the current
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
process that we have now that requires
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
in-hand service had something like 30
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
different boxes
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
from the process starting with our
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
office where one of our attorneys looks
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
at the record decides who qualifies
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
we have support staff who prepares the
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
order to appear in the driving record
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
essentially what we call the ho packet
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
which then would go to state police it
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
would be assigned to a trooper
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
now it's troopers at troop g
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
who have that responsibility so the
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
packet would go from our office after
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
several steps to troop g to a trooper
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
who would have to find the person at
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
their home
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
at their place of business and serve the
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
paperwork in hand for the person to come
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
back for the hearing as a result of the
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
first lien event we came up with a new
 
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.589 align:start position:0%
first lien event we came up with a new
process

00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
by which we would send out an initial
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
letter to every habitual offender
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
subject inviting them to voluntarily
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
come into our office
 
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.550 align:start position:0%
come into our office
and

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
to be served in hand by a trooper so we
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
started that process
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
right now we do it every other tuesday
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock so what we do is we send
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
out 25 letters
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
so the first 25 people were trying to
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
initiate the process with inviting them
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
to voluntarily come into our office we
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
have a trooper from troop g right now
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
it's a retired sergeant who comes in
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
every other tuesday and whoever appears
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
out of the 25 letters they get served
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
their hearing paperwork and they can
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
choose to have their hearing that day or
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
they can come back at a later date so
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that kind of revised
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
process as an internal solution
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
to the issue of the long periods of time
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
that it takes to get someone in for one
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
of these hearings
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
and that has reduced time for some of
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
the people for those that choose to come
 
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.470 align:start position:0%
the people for those that choose to come
in

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
based on an involuntary invitation
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
based on the numbers we've seen while
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
we've done that process we get about
 
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.670 align:start position:0%
we've done that process we get about
half

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
half
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
on a good day maybe a little more than
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
half out of the first time we resumed
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
the voluntary service tuesdays we got 13
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
out of 25 which wasn't bad unfortunately
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
like many things during covid19
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
we weren't doing any
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the voluntary service on those
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
tuesdays everything was going out to
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
state police for in-hand service
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
and just
 
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.390 align:start position:0%
and just
the

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
benefit for the person really it's not
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
helpful to a person for this process to
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
be a long one before they come in for
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
these certification hearings because
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
habitual offender is is based on a
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
number and type of conviction within
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
five years major convictions for
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
habitual offender are driving under the
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
influence disobeying a police officer
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
driving after suspension
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
most habitual offenders have at least
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
one major there are some minors and
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
there are different combinations that i
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
don't really need to get into
 
00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.630 align:start position:0%
don't really need to get into
but

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
for a lot of habitual offenders they're
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
already under suspension for another
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
reason it's typical they're under
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
suspension for a dwi
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
so they're serving a court suspension
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
some cases or in fact a lot of cases
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
because of the enhanced service
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
requirement it delays the time between
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
when they qualify for habitual offender
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
until they get to our office
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
for one of our hearings examiners to do
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
the certification and to do what may be
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
a separate license suspension it's a
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
mandatory suspension for
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
habitual offender but for someone who
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
was already under suspension and who has
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
been under suspension ever since the
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
last conviction that's causing habitual
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
offender the hearings examiner can date
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
the licensed suspension back to the
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
court date so for the person if they can
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
serve or at least begin serving this
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
habitual offender minimum one year
 
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.030 align:start position:0%
habitual offender minimum one year
suspension

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
suspension
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
effective on the date of the court
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
hearing they're better off they've got
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
time served they can then be decertified
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
sooner than if
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
years go by and we see this happen
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
the trooper's not able to serve someone
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
several years go by
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
kind of these unable to serve paperworks
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
just sit and not a lot happens with them
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
after the trooper makes three attempts
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
to serve
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
they kind of go in a drawer and where it
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
catches up with the person is when they
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
seek restoration of their license
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
they're at the dmv
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
then we're trying to then serve while
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
they're at the dmv
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
that adds layers of process so really
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
the first rationale behind this is to to
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
have the process go much more quickly so
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
rather than having an enhanced service
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
we would send out that hearing notice
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
and the driver record
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
by first class mail to the address of
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
record and the license holder is
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
obligated to
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
have an updated address with the
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles and when
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
they move to do within a certain period
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
of time so essentially this this would
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
put some burden back on the license
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
holder where it should be because a
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
license is a privilege that is something
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
that was recognized
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
during our studies of this issue is that
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's the responsibility of the license
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
holder to a large degree
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
to do what they're supposed to do and to
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
to let the dmv know what their address
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
is so that proceedings like this can be
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
commenced more simply and easily for the
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
citizen as well as for
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
the department of safety this also will
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
give citizens
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
a certainty of result of what the final
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
license suspension term is if this
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
habitual offender hearing is hanging out
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
there unresolved
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of people they don't understand
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
they think they're serving their
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
suspension already they're thinking it's
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
an automatic process after they went to
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
the court they don't understand that
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly complicated process within
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
hand service that's required for them to
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
resolve their case so this will allow
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
more people to serve their license
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
suspension time concurrently where the
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
law allows it also it's an embarrassment
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
for someone to have a trooper knock on
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
their door and serve paperwork
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
for a licensed suspension issue so this
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
will eliminate that and one thing that
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
was alluded to when one of these studies
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
at the department of safety was having
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
increased law enforcement contacts may
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
not be a good thing it could be an
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
officer safety type issue having these
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
contacts just for
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
a simple procedure of serving paperwork
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
although i'm not sure i've never heard
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
of any incident happening
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
during an enhanced service lieutenant
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
o'leary from troop g is here present if
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
the committee has any questions for him
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to expedite our testimony
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
by having me be the the spokesperson for
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
all of the issues
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
and then just
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
having a much more expeditious
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
administrative process this bill
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
will allow us to do it
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
and there are some other states we have
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
looked at that allow for mailing of
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
habitual offender either pay hearing
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
paperwork or suspension notices vermont
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
maine and massachusetts all allow for
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
first-class mailing of some of this
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
habitual offender either suspension
 
00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:41.910 align:start position:0%
habitual offender either suspension
notice

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:42.870 align:start position:0%
notice
or

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.910 align:start position:0%
or
hearing

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
paperwork so those are the reasons why
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're in favor of this it's something
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at for a long time
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
and decided that legislation was the
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
answer rather than going to
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
jalcar to amend the administrative rule
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
we figured this was the preferable
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
procedure and i did talk at length with
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
attorney halverson because to put on my
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
prosecutor hat i supervise department of
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
safety prosecutors and i understand the
 
00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:12.390 align:start position:0%
safety prosecutors and i understand the
concern

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.270 align:start position:0%
concern
with

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
a habitual offender certification that
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
will be based on a mailed
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
notice of the hearing
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
so there will be people that fail to
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
appear in response to the mailed hearing
 
00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.550 align:start position:0%
appear in response to the mailed hearing
notice

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
and this bill would allow those people
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
to be defaulted we are open to
 
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.190 align:start position:0%
to be defaulted we are open to
alternatives

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.270 align:start position:0%
that would
would

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
cause more certainty in the final
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
process because for
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
someone who's now the current process
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
allows for a default because the person
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
is given a hearing date in hand from a
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer within that
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
habitual offender packet there are clear
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
warnings that if you fail to appear for
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
the hearing you will be certified
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
habitual offender and default in the
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
order then goes into effect and then
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
that order is mailed to someone who
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
defaults and it's
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's mailed based on the in-hand service
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the hearing notice so this would be
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
a change to
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
do first-class mail for the hearing
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
notice and the driver record to initiate
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
the process a couple of ideas that we
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
came up with a rather than allow for a
 
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.630 align:start position:0%
came up with a rather than allow for a
default

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
default
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
after the mail notice is either some
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
in-hand service of the default order or
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
another alternative rather than
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
defaulting the person who doesn't appear
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
at the hearing putting an additional
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
suspension or if their license is not
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
under suspension to put in place a
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
suspension of the license until they
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
appear to be served with the habitual
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
offender paperwork so we're open to
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
different ideas if the committee was
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
inclined to not go with this as written
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
we're in favor of it as written and
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
recommend ought to pass but we're very
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
open-minded in anything we can do
 
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.349 align:start position:0%
open-minded in anything we can do
to

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
make this process better for citizens
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
and for the state that's what the intent
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill is i'm happy to take any
 
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.030 align:start position:0%
of this bill is i'm happy to take any
questions

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.270 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
mr casco how are you today i'm fine how
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
are you representative good to see you
 
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.710 align:start position:0%
are you representative good to see you
um

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
you just made some a statement which i
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
picked up on that that might be a a way
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
to come to some common ground about what
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
could be done
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
i fully respect the idea that you're
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
trying to streamline the process and
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
make it happen better for
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
i don't have any issue with that the
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
issue i have though is if
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many times you've
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
gotten your first class mail not
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
delivered properly
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
it happens
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't there be some process here's
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
my question thank you for being patient
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
with me
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't there be
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
you can do the streamline process to
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
begin with but then after that shouldn't
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
there be a
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
follow through where you go back to the
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
old system of hand delivered so that the
 
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.829 align:start position:0%
old system of hand delivered so that the
person

00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
gets their day
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
to talk about whatever the issues might
 
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.549 align:start position:0%
to talk about whatever the issues might
be

00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative i certainly think
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's fair
 
00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.950 align:start position:0%
that's that's fair
and

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
we mail out all other hearing notices
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
for every other hearing type and we are
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
very careful before defaulting someone
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure the hearing notice went to
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
the address of record on the system if
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
we get return mail we won't do a
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
suspension or if we've suspended and
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
then get return mail we'd vacate that
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
suspension because it's not fair where
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
we know someone didn't get the notice by
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
mail to then take action
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
so we would be very careful with with
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
this process before
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
simply defaulting by mail but we're very
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
willing to come to some common ground
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
less than well we're going to default as
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
habitual offender based just on the mail
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
notice some other process at the back
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
end because
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
the cases that are problematic are the
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
people that will who who fail to appear
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
at the hearing for people who appear at
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
the hearing the hearings examiner does
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
the hearing makes a finding right there
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
writes up a hearing order hands it to
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
the person reads them the hearing order
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
makes it very clear that you can't drive
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
to drive as a felony do you understand
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
you need to be decertified i mean we go
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
through a step-by-step process
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
when i certify someone i check off that
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
i have read every single
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
finding of fact on the habitual offender
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
hearing order
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
all our hearings are audio recorded so
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
that supports what we said to the person
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
at the time so if attorney halverson's
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
office gets a case for habitual offender
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
where someone appeared at the hearing
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's very clear
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
what notifications were done when they
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
go to prosecute so really the area to
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
find a solution that may be considered
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
unresolved is how do we best handle the
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
defaults if we're allowed to send out
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
the initial hearing notice by first
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
class mail
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up sure thank you mr
 
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.870 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up sure thank you mr
chairman

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
um mr casco
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
this is a somewhat of a loaded question
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
and you can
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
not answer it if you choose to but
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm struggling with whose responsibility
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
it would be to make that
 
00:51:37.839 --> 00:51:38.790 align:start position:0%
it would be to make that
change

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
i i worry that it's not necessarily
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
legislative responsibility to make that
 
00:51:44.319 --> 00:51:45.750 align:start position:0%
legislative responsibility to make that
correction

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
correction
 
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.710 align:start position:0%
correction
or

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
could you bring language back to us that
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
would allow us to make that correction
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
who's who should be doing that
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
correction is the question
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of an amendment to the current
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
bill representative yes i'm certainly
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're willing to
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
to bring back proposals if the committee
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
is inclined to do that at a work session
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
in fact i have a couple of different
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
that i kind of just drafted up yesterday
 
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.309 align:start position:0%
that i kind of just drafted up yesterday
as

00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
if if it came up that amendments were
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
the way that this the committee
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
preferred that we would submit those so
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm happy to email the committee the
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
the two that i kind of came up with
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday after i talked with attorney
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
halverson and then internally i spoke
 
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.349 align:start position:0%
halverson and then internally i spoke
with

00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
lieutenant o'leary and mr keller from
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
the dmv we had a pretty lengthy meeting
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
trying to hash all this out and come up
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
with what our best proposal ultimately
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.790 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
committee

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
i appreciate
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
you testifying today
 
00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.349 align:start position:0%
you testifying today
um

00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
when there sent a letter of habitual
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
offender hearings
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
are they
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
already suspended at that point
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'd say most people are the the vast
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
majority are already suspended some
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
aren't it really depends on the type of
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
convictions it's possible for someone to
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
have 12 speeding tickets and qualify
 
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.870 align:start position:0%
have 12 speeding tickets and qualify
although

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
although
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
i can tell you i i don't see those very
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
often but if you have 12 speeding
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
tickets and they're all plea by mails
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
and you qualify you pro you won't be
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
suspended yet you may be because demerit
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
points is another administrative
 
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.030 align:start position:0%
points is another administrative
procedure

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
that 12 speeding to 12 speeding tickets
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
is a lot of demerit points so probably
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
you will have been suspended for points
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
before you get that 12th ticket but you
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
may have your license restored at that
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
time so you're coming in to get
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
suspended first for habitual offender
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
but it's more common that someone is
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
already under suspension for other
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
reasons by the time they qualify okay
 
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.069 align:start position:0%
reasons by the time they qualify okay
follow

00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
what happens to someone if that's the
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
case if they haven't gotten the letter
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
yet they get stopped they're under
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
suspension are they going to go to jail
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
what's the process habitual offender is
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
either a felony offense in most cases
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's a felony under the statute for
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
prosecuting habitual offenders if
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
someone has a dwi or a misdemeanor motor
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle offense that is part of the
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
convictions that certify them habitual
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
offender then that makes it a felony if
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have a dwi or a misdemeanor
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle conviction then driving in
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
violation of that order is a misdemeanor
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
so the 12 speeding tickets would be a
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level habitual offender
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
prosecution if they're driving in
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
violation of that although now before
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
anyone has an habitual offender hearing
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
they're all served in hand with the
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
hearing notice
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
in the paperwork warns them if they
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
don't appear at the hearing they'll be
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
suspended in default
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
by not appearing one more if i may
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
um one more
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
how many a year roughly do you have how
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
many habitual offenders
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's around a thousand and i ran a few
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
of the numbers for the past several
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
years so in 2019 the total habitual
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
offender hearing so this is where we had
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
so we had 612 habitual offender hearings
 
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
out of those and then
 
00:55:41.549 --> 00:55:41.559 align:start position:0%
498 were marked as unable to serve
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
213 did not appear at their hearing so
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
they were found habitual offender in
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
default so that was 800 out of the 1300
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
but there was this group of almost 500
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
who were unable to serve
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
so then who knows how many of those
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
since 2019 were tracked down and served
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
or went to the dmv to get their license
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
and were then served and then i'll skip
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
2020 because that was the covert year so
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
the numbers are way down but in 2021 it
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
was 1022
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
habitual offenders
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
585 had hearings and were certified 77
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
were defaults and would have been
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
certified and then 360
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
were marked as unable to serve so
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
between unable to serve and defaults
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
those are are numbers that that we've we
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
try to deal with because really we want
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
to make those numbers small we want to
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
certify people at hearings
 
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.030 align:start position:0%
certify people at hearings
and

00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
everyone knows what the result is and
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
they can resolve their case and get on
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
the path to getting their license
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
legally restored rather than
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
staying under suspension for years and
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
years and years thank you very much
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
you're welcome any other questions from
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
one question okay we're running late one
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
question okay i'll make it a brief
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chair
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking the question so
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
the question i have is you mentioned 500
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
unable to serve in uh
 
00:57:14.079 --> 00:57:16.390 align:start position:0%
unable to serve in uh
2019

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
usually when you hear that number you
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
assume that they were unreachable the
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
address had changed and so forth so by
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
the provision in this if it becomes law
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
would that help you serve those people
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
would that still be problematic to reach
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
those people
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
no we think it would help because they
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
would get the notice by mail
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
as long as they've updated their address
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
they'll get it they'll know and they'll
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
come to the hearing so our hope would be
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
that the number of unable or not
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
appearing or defaults would be greatly
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
reduced by starting the process earlier
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
on closer in time than when they went to
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
court because i think another problem
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
historically is that they go to court
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
for that that last conviction
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
it takes a year to serve them and get in
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
for our hearing
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
they thought they think they've resolved
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
everything and they may disregard even
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
after in
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
or if they haven't been served then
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
they'll kind of think well i'm all set
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
they they don't worry about habitual
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
offender even though in court in the
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
wavering acknowledgment of rights for
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
people who plead guilty to habitual
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
offender offenses there's a warning
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
about habitual offender in the plea
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
coliques in court the judges go through
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
habitual offender especially if someone
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
is known to qualify at the time of that
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
court hearing but people still a lot of
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
this is is fairly complicated into the
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
average person
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
even though they've had contact with the
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
system because they have several
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
offenses they don't quite understand
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
there are two separate procedures
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you any other
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%

1239 fn before we open the next one i'm
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
going to give the
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
just deals with suspensions and stuff
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's all about nail and notification
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm just gonna pass it over like i
 
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
running a little late
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
i will call
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1240 fn intercession
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
our first speaker is
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative walsh
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair members of the
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee for the record tom walsh
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
represented from the town of hooksett
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh and once again i'm introducing 1240
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh is uh at the request of the
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles department
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
of safety
 
01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.710 align:start position:0%
of safety
um

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
just for the sake of time this actually
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
deals with the same issue that the last
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
bill did this talks about notification
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh by first class mail as opposed to
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
certified a little different caveat in
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
this one a defendant on line eight shall
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
be presumed to have been served three
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
days after mailing of the notice
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
again there are people that spoke on the
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
last one
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
the last one was uh
 
01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.029 align:start position:0%
the last one was uh
um

01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
habitual offenders this one deals
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
specifically with suspension and
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
revocation for default so with that i
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
would defer any questions to the
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
if the uh i just want to clarify if this
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
came directly from director bilecki also
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
as similar to the last bill yes it did
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
next up
 
01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.270 align:start position:0%

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
name is brittany xu i am the bureau
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
administrator of financial
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility this bill is at the
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
request of the department this is a
 
01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.430 align:start position:0%
request of the department this is a
process

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
of being able to send notification of a
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
not served in hand citation
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
a not served in hand citation is one
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's written by law enforcement and
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
they indicated that the defendant
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
themselves did not receive this ticket
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
by them specifically in hand
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
the reason we are asking for this is
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
currently the process requires that we
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
send these notifications by a certified
 
01:03:27.039 --> 01:03:28.150 align:start position:0%
send these notifications by a certified
mail

01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
mail
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
in addition to certified mail being
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
costly it also involves a time of

division members to prepare these
 
01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.150 align:start position:0%
division members to prepare these
correspondences

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
correspondences
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
get them over to our warehouse our
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
warehouse gets them out into the mail so
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of additional costs that
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
go along besides the certified mail
 
01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.710 align:start position:0%
go along besides the certified mail
itself

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
so through this we're hoping to gain
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in our operation and we're
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
also looking to be more fiscally
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
responsible by decreasing the
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
expenditures to the department
 
01:03:58.559 --> 01:04:00.069 align:start position:0%
expenditures to the department
currently

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
the postage rate is 7.33
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
per certification
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's the certification and the postage
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
u.s first class mail is currently 58
 
01:04:10.319 --> 01:04:11.829 align:start position:0%
u.s first class mail is currently 58
cents

01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
cents
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
last year or on an annual basis we spend
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
approximately sixty eight hundred
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
dollars in mailing alone
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
if we were to move to a first class mail
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
process it would save the department
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
approximately sixty two hundred dollars
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
for the month of december
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
we entered 52 not served enhanced
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
citations onto our database
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
of those 52 items 25 were returned
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
so for 52 items it cost us 381.16
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the returned items of that was 183
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
dollars and 25 cents
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
comparatively at an 80
 
01:04:47.599 --> 01:04:48.870 align:start position:0%
comparatively at an 80
savings

01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
savings
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
it would have initially cost us 30 and
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
16 cents and we would have gotten back
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
14.50 worth
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
just to give you an idea of the items
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
that are not served in hand the top
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
three items tend to be
 
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
non-inspections of vehicles
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
unregistered vehicles
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
and speeding
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
and in regards to
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
the presumed um
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
the three days after the mailing it
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
gives us a starting point
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
please know that after we mail these out
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
the ticket goes on to the system
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
after that 30-day mark the department
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
then sends a follow-up notice letting
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
them know they defaulted prior to a
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
suspension taken effect
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
with that i will be happy to take any
 
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.349 align:start position:0%
with that i will be happy to take any
questions

01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
any questions for this witness
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead reference crawford
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman my question is um
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
after 30 days
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
are do you mail out another notice
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
when they're in default or
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
first class or do you send it certified
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
mail thank you for your question the
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
default notification is also sent via
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
first class mail all of the
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
notifications from the department go out
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
first class mail
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
that notification lets them know that
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
they have an additional 30 days to pay
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
the citation itself
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
plus the administrative late fee prior
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
to going into suspension it is very
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
clear that the suspension time
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
and the date when it takes effect
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
tulerski thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i just want to
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
clarify because as we stated in the
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
previous bill the um
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
slowing of the u.s mail service in the
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
last couple years is concerning and the
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
three days
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
although in state mail concerns me a
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
little bit so i just want to clarify
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
that you're stating
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to happen on day four it
 
01:06:33.359 --> 01:06:34.390 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to happen on day four it
simply

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
sets the clock ticking for a 30 day
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
period thank you for your question you
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
are correct okay thank you
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
next up
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
paul halverson
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
would you turn on your microphone please
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
i would note that in a default in a
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
court environment the the judge will
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
issue a default from from the bench uh
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's one of the options that that the
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
judge has it's not a requirement but uh
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's an option uh again we come
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
down to the basic notice issue if
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
someone drives after a default such as
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
this and suspension uh occurs charging
 
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
them under
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
rsa26364 which is operating after
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
suspension re requires that they uh that
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
they knowingly commit deact
 
01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.549 align:start position:0%
they knowingly commit deact
and

01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
first class mail
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
draws into a question whether or not
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
they have proper notice
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
i'll refer to you back to my other
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
testimony any other bill
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
and if you don't mind
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
incorporating that by reference i'll end
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
it there and take any questions
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
the witness
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative terosha
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you sir for
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:07.910 align:start position:0%
taking the question
so

01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
in this instance if this change becomes
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
law then somebody could be notified by
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
first class mail and within three days
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
of that notice assumed that they
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
received it so if they were traveling or
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
out of the away from their permanent
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
address they would
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
may not have gotten it would that be a
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
possibility i i guess one could one
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
could assume that yeah yeah and and then
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
you're also assuming that male is going
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
to get them within three three three
 
01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.470 align:start position:0%
to get them within three three three
days

01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
and you know by just by way of of of
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
background i think that the
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
post office has recently changed their
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
standards for delivery of mail i don't
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
think it's three days anymore i think it
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
might be five for first class mail i'm
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
i remember reading that in the news
 
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.470 align:start position:0%
i remember reading that in the news
somewhere

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:54.630 align:start position:0%
somewhere
so

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%

01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
was passed in 2002 and as most of you
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
probably remember the world was a very
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
different place back then
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
i read through the hearing notes and the
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
impetus for the bill was a concern about
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
the privacy of the magnetic strip on the
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
back of licenses
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
lawmakers at the time were concerned
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
that businesses were recording and
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
storing information from this magnetic
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
strip and using it for marketing
 
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.669 align:start position:0%
strip and using it for marketing
purposes

01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
now fast forward to 2022 we don't have
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
magnetic strips on our licenses anymore
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
companies really aren't interested in
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
gathering our information from our
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses to use for marketing
 
01:12:07.199 --> 01:12:08.470 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses to use for marketing
purposes

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
they use smartphone apps rewards
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
programs and credit card information for
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
all that now
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
additionally just in the past few years
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
i've had my driver's license requested
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
and copied multiple times
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
when i applied to refinance my house the
 
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
bank wanted me to take a picture of my
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
own license and email it to them
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
when i closed on the loan the closing
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%

it
 
01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
when i go to a new doctor's office or
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
my license
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
when i applied to become a driver for

times have changed and this new law
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
should be updated i'm sorry this law
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
should be updated to allow an individual
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
to take a photo of their own license or
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
someone else to take a photo of the
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
license holders of the license with the
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
license holders consent so that people
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
can go on with their lives in the modern
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
era and i'll take any questions
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
any questions for the witness
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative o'hara
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative don't we can't we
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
currently i'm just trying to understand
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
what the intent of this law is because
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
can't we currently give consent for our
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
license to be copied
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
 
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:32.870 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
question

01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.830 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
we can give consent for our license to
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
be copied in a non-electronic manner so
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
somebody could
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
jot down the information on the front of
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
or that's contained on the front of the
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
license but they cannot take an
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
electronic copy so they couldn't take a
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
cell phone picture or use a scanner or
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%

fenton thank you for taking my question
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
so say you're purchasing a vehicle and
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
i've done this in the past when you're
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
going to the automobile dealership they
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
scan your license into the system are
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
you saying that's illegal at this
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
current law stance
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
according to my reading of the statute
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
represented tolerski
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
bolden um there's nothing here that
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
actually would
 
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.470 align:start position:0%
actually would
specify

01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
specify
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
how the person will um demonstrate
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
their um
 
01:14:33.199 --> 01:14:34.790 align:start position:0%
their um
consent

01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
would it just be considered verbal since
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's not specified
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative yeah i believe that a
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
simple verbal
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
consent would probably suffice
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
unless the committee you know would like
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
something else obviously they could
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
amend the bill
 
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.830 align:start position:0%
amend the bill
thank

01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
consent being handing the license over
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%

a i'm not a lawyer or a judge but i
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
would assume that a court would probably
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
to highlight that senate bill 311
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
311 also proposes changes to this um
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
statute so i just wanted to throw that
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
out there for consideration that is it
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%

oops

01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
i have a question for the chair would um
 
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
mr oberdenko i believe is the director
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
of licensing be willing to take a
 
01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:07.590 align:start position:0%
of licensing be willing to take a
question

01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is jeff
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
oberdank and i am with the division of
 
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles formerly with driver
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
licensing currently with registration
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
but i've got a
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
about 20 years worth of background in
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
driver licensing so i could certainly
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
take some questions but
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
just to touch on the testimony that was
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
given earlier
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
scanned and retained would mean scanning
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
the 2d barcode on the back of the
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
license and retaining that information
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
in a database
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
and some of the things we've had to
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
address in the past were companies that
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
were for instance sears was using that
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
information they would scan the license
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody was
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
returning tools or things and they were
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
keeping a database to find out if there
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
was any fraudulent activity
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
that was against the the prohibition in
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
2614 you could not do that
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
now photocopying the license when you're
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
test driving a car at the dealership
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely legal because it's not
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
keeping it electronically it's just a
 
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.390 align:start position:0%
keeping it electronically it's just a
photocopy

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
photocopy
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the license and it's really just a
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
snapshot in time that you were there and
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
that you were purporting to be a
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
properly licensed driver at the time you
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
were test driving the vehicle
 
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.630 align:start position:0%
were test driving the vehicle
so

01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if that answers the
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
question but just based on what i heard
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
from testimony scanning and retaining is
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
actually grabbing pulling the license
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
off the 2d barcode and keeping it in a
 
01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.750 align:start position:0%
off the 2d barcode and keeping it in a
database

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um i remember a bill we had
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
last term perhaps
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
that touched on the same issue it had to
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
do with i believe a school system that
 
01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
had a new security
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
concept where they would scan the
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
licenses of visitors to the school and
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
we had these discussions
 
01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:52.390 align:start position:0%
we had these discussions
i

01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
can you just touch on a little bit
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
similar situations or say when you hand
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
it over to the doctor and they slide it
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
through a machine i'm assuming that's an
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
electronic capture am i correct in that
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is not allowed by the
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
law that is correct and i do remember
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
that bill from last year uh
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative and that was for the same
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
reason it was scanning and pulling that
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
information from that 2d barcode in the
 
01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:21.830 align:start position:0%
information from that 2d barcode in the
back

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
which the information in that barcode is
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
everything listed on the front and that
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
was considered driver privacy
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
information that they were capturing and
 
01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.910 align:start position:0%
information that they were capturing and
keeping

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%

record my name is
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative george sykes i serve
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%

01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to speak in support of this
 
01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.350 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to speak in support of this
bill

01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
before i get to the particulars of the
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
bill itself i just wanted to make
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee aware of some
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
demographics or statistics that i think
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
are relevant to this bill
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
and that is that for the first time
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
in decades
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
population increased
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
rather than decreased
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty significant because a
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
lot of states are losing population we
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
were fortunate that we according to the
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
2020 census the population in new
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire went up
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
behind that number
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
is another fact
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
that the largest single cohort
 
01:29:23.159 --> 01:29:25.030 align:start position:0%
that the largest single cohort
identifiable

01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
identifiable
 
01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:25.750 align:start position:0%
identifiable
are

01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
legal immigrants coming into the into
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
the state these are people who come and
 
01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.270 align:start position:0%
the state these are people who come and
do

01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
work for
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
various jobs from professionals to
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
agricultural work etc
 
01:29:37.679 --> 01:29:38.790 align:start position:0%
agricultural work etc
and

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
most would agree that having an
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
increasing population and the talent
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
that comes in from
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
this identifiable cohort is important
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
this bill will help support
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
at the present time
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
according to federal regulations and i'm
 
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
not going to get into the specific
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
details there might be someone else who
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
can do a better job of that
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
at the present time in new hampshire
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
if you are a legal immigrant
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
but not a citizen of new hampshire you
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
cannot get a real id
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would bring
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in alignment with the
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
federal regulations which allows
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
for a legal immigrant to get a real id
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
real id is important for a variety of
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
reasons not least of which is to
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
facilitate travel
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
and for the kinds of people that we were
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
for the people that are coming to the
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
state they may have opportunities to
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
travel for work
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
for family reasons and putting
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
roadblocks in their way is
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
counter to the best interests of the
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
state and
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
what i believe to be important thank you
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
i i will take it i'll take questions but
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
again i'm going to leave it up to some
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
other folks who can do a better job
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
maybe thank you representative any
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%

01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
as current statute is we cannot issue a
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
real id to legal immigrants
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
that is a that is how i understand to be
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
the current state of affairs okay i just
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
want to make sure thank you
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
i have one just for clarification
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned legal citizens for work
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
and such i'm assuming that's green cards
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
or work visas
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
isn't there already
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
the way in law for them to get a
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
driver's license are you saying they
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
can't get a real id
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
so once you have a in new hampshire if
 
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
an illegal immigrant in this state
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
you can get
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
a driver's license if you have a work
 
01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:42.390 align:start position:0%
a driver's license if you have a work
permit

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
permit
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
what you can't but that is a
 
01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.229 align:start position:0%
what you can't but that is a
non-compliant

01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
non-compliant
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
other than real id
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%

give you trouble is a good thing
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
i remember one day when my mother was in
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
pain and uh it seemed hopeless uh
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
i remember driving to the to the store
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
um over let's say
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
record speed
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
and turning back in record speed
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
was okay
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
it was at also at the time where it was
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
the beginning stage of the pandemic
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%

01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to say is
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of the situation
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
people still need to make sure
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
that there's food on their table and
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
that involves
 
01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.070 align:start position:0%
that involves
driving

01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:52.950 align:start position:0%

people still got to go to their work
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%

this bill is that it simply it's a
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
simple matter in that it brings new

classes of applicants that would be
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for real id and in these
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
classes of applicants are not
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
being offered in the state these classes
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
of applicants are much broader than the
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
current eligibility standards that the
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
dmv offers and this law would bring our
 
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
state into compliance and open up these
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
categories which are already federally
 
01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:36.950 align:start position:0%
categories which are already federally
passed

01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
and make that available in to new
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
it is mandatory as we know that the new
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire dnb allow all eligible
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
applicants to obtain real id
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
and this bill does simply does a simple
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
matter of bringing this our state into
 
01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
compliance um so that's the technical
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
aspect of it and i think that's a very
 
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
important and it's the heart and spirit
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill um but also at the heart
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
and spirit of this bill is that part of
 
01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:03.109 align:start position:0%
and spirit of this bill is that part of
the

01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
the those who would be eligible to be
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
able to drive what this bill would do
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
includes people like me includes people
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
in my community
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
as well as other immigrants in the state
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
for many for those who
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
none of you know me but i grew up in new
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire i've lived in the state since
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
i since 1989 when i was two years old
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i started to drive in 2018
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
and so when we are saying that this not
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
only does this bill bring us into
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
compliance it also allows an opportunity
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
for many new hampshire residents who
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
would be otherwise eligible to be able
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
to care for their families go to work do
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
the things that they need to do as we
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
all very well know living in the state
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
how difficult it is to get around and do
 
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
what we need to do without a car so i
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to please pass
 
01:40:49.119 --> 01:40:50.790 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to please pass

chair recognizes sarah sarah noy uh also
 
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.280 align:start position:0%

01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
my name is sarah jane kenoi i'm the
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
executive director of the granite state
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%

01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire immigrant solidarity
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
network i did not intend to testify
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
today although i do support this bill i
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to note that earlier one of
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
the committee members asked a question
 
01:41:54.639 --> 01:41:55.750 align:start position:0%
the committee members asked a question
about

01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
if a person has a work permit can they
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
not get a driver's license or a real id
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
and the problem is right at this moment
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
a person can be here 100 legally can be
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
qualified to work
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
and can be waiting for over a year
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
because of bureaucratic delays for that
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
work permit and so that is another
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
reason why this law is necessary is to
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that people who are qualified
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
to drive are able to get those driver's
 
01:42:21.199 --> 01:42:22.310 align:start position:0%
to drive are able to get those driver's
licenses

01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
so that's all i wanted to say about
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh this bill today i do hope you'll
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%

01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
the passing of this legislation
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
at the very current moment new hampshire
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
does not comply with the federal federal
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
id act of 2005
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
passing this law will make sure that new
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire does comply when it becomes
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
effective in may 2023
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
we have had issues
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
with individuals that are eligible to

01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
driver's license at the dmv and it has
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
been you know dealt on a case-by-case
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
basis and this legislation will just
 
01:44:01.590 --> 01:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
remove you know that that need and make
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
sure that new hampshire again is
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
compliant and provides a driver's
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
license to people who are otherwise
 
01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:10.870 align:start position:0%
license to people who are otherwise
eligible

01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
the current statute
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
reads that only u.s citizens are
 
01:44:15.119 --> 01:44:16.390 align:start position:0%
reads that only u.s citizens are
eligible

01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
and that's not what the real id says
 
01:44:20.159 --> 01:44:21.030 align:start position:0%
and that's not what the real id says
so

01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
i'm open to 20 questions
 
01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:24.950 align:start position:0%

the committee for the record my name is
 
01:44:53.590 --> 01:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
jeff obernank and i'm here to testify
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of the division of motor
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles about this bill
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and we are opposed to the bill
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
because of the language in the way that
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's written
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
but i've also heard a lot of testimony
 
01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:04.470 align:start position:0%
but i've also heard a lot of testimony
about

01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
how new hampshire is not in compliance
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
with the real id regulation and we are
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
in compliance that's the only way to get
 
01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.070 align:start position:0%
in compliance that's the only way to get
approval

01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
approval
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
there is an approval process that goes
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
through homeland security that it was a
 
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
very strict approval process that we
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
went through
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
i personally wrote the submission and
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
received the
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
notice to proceed which is why we're
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
able to put the real id star on the
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
right-hand corner of the license the
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
only way to get that is to be in
 
01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:32.790 align:start position:0%
only way to get that is to be in
compliance

01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
so having said that i do want to look at
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill and draw your
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
attention specifically to
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
page two
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
line number seven
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
or excuse me line number nine that says
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
has a
 
01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:47.510 align:start position:0%
has a
pending

01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
pending
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
or approved application
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
for temporary protective status or a
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
pending application for asylum which is
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
on line eight and i also
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
hand it out to all of you a packet which
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
is the real id act and if you turn your
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
attention to page two
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
specifically probably about halfway down
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
the page
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
number two b
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
evidence of lawful status and i want to
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to the word shall a
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
state shall
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
require before issuing driver's license
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
or identification card to a person valid
 
01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:22.950 align:start position:0%
or identification card to a person valid
documentary

01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
documentary
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
evidence that the person and if you go
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
down through
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
you'll see specifically number four
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
which is in direct conflict
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
to the statute with to the to the
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
correction that's being written here in
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
the statute is has an approved
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
application for asylum
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
not a pending application and there's a
 
01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
big difference
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
and the difference being is that when
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
you submit an application for anything
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
there is an approval process
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
no different than if you would apply for
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
credit or if you're purchasing a vehicle
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
there's an application
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
process and then there's an approval
 
01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:57.270 align:start position:0%
process and then there's an approval
process

01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
had we issued real id compliant licenses
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
to people who are in the application
 
01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.950 align:start position:0%
to people who are in the application
process

01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
and would ultimately come back as being
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
denied for whatever reason we would be
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
in violation of the real id act
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
so having said that
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions the committee
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
o'hara thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
director sorry
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
um so i just want to get this clear for
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
you if we do pass 1463 it would make us
 
01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:32.870 align:start position:0%
you if we do pass 1463 it would make us
now

01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
not be in compliance with the real id
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
act the way it's written correct okay
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
the real id
 
01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
license is a different license than what
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
most of us probably
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
have if we haven't renewed it is it
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
possible for people with a pending
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
application to get
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
a regular license and not a real id so
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
that they could drive on the roads
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's not possible and i'll draw your
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
263 39a and administrative rule 1002.06
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
where the process is clearly outlined
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
that says for any
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
type of driver license that there is an
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
approved process an approval process
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you taking
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
what is the difference
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
with number seven uh has a pending or
 
01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
approved application for temporary
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
protected status in the united states
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
pending application would be for
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that's filed but that's not
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
gone through the approval process
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
so there's a and i've not had to go
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
through the process but you when you
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
when you apply for process there's
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting background check there
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
are those types of things that are done
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
before approval is is given
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's for any any type of status
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.639 --> 01:49:06.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr urban for taking
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
so in the federal real id act
 
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
um it does not specify
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
it it does it specifies
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
as one of the people that's eligible is
 
01:49:29.119 --> 01:49:29.830 align:start position:0%
as one of the people that's eligible is
a

01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
u.s citizen or
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
somebody who has one of the other
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
statuses that's listed in special
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
requirements section two
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
on page two of the real id act so it
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
gives you all of those other categories
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:46.310 align:start position:0%
as well
follow-up

01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.570 --> 01:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
so then is the
 
01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:50.870 align:start position:0%
so then is the
[Music]

01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
only problem
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
the approved application for asylum as
 
01:49:55.599 --> 01:49:56.629 align:start position:0%
the approved application for asylum as
it's

01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
written because i know we've had this
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
discussion of the problems in the
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
waiting period right for asylum seekers
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
to your point representative that has
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
been the problem at some points i've
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
seen the weight go as long as eight or
 
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
nine months or even up to a year
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes for some of those applications
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
to go through
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
and in my 22 years it's changed with
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
every administration i've seen it as
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
quick as 30 days
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
in early years past and i've seen it as
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
as almost as far as a year out before
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
next up chair recognizes
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
the honorable neil kirk
 
01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:56.470 align:start position:0%
the honorable neil kirk
um

01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for the record i'm
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
neil kirk i live in where
 
01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:02.390 align:start position:0%
neil kirk i live in where
and

01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
a lot a number of questions about this
 
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill i'm not sure whether i support it
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
or oppose it
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
but this bill is complicated
 
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
and it expands the number of people who
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
will be eligible to get either real id
 
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
or non-real id licenses in new hampshire
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
and that's a very important policy
 
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
question for this committee
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you get
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
very significant legal and technical
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
advice from dmv and perhaps from the
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
as to exactly whether we are in
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
compliance or not in compliance with the
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
real id act currently
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
and whether
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
what this bill does specifically on page
 
01:51:45.199 --> 01:51:46.390 align:start position:0%
what this bill does specifically on page
two

01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.310 align:start position:0%
two
um

01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
starting at line six number five and

number of people who are eligible for

01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
the dmv gentleman mentioned number six

and number seven
 
01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
on lines 8 and 9
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
with the word pending
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
explaining that person with a pending
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
application would be eligible for a
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
license in new hampshire real id license
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
and that's contrary to the federal
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
regulations i'd also
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
like to point out to you on line 11 the
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
word is or
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
all you have to do to be eligible is to
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
meet one of those not all nine but just
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
any one of them
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
the other point i'd like to bring to the
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee's attention is section c
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
starting on line 15
 
01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
which says basically
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
that if a person
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
presents evidence of
 
01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:02.950 align:start position:0%
presents evidence of
items

01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
five through nine in the prior paragraph
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
the individual can get a temporary
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
non-id driver's license
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
and c describes what has to be done
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
for this to happen and how long that
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
license is good for
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
so where this bill to pass
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
a person in the united states
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
who's i think physically in the united
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
states files an application for asylum
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
or files an application
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh for um
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
protected status
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
or has a valid non-immigrant or
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
immigrant id
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
or has approved deferred action status i
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
don't know what that means
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
or has an i 797 form showing pending
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
application that person will not be
 
01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
eligible for real id or maybe eligible
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
for real id
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
but also would be eligible as he is not
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
now as i understand it for a new
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire driver's license non-real id
 
01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:13.270 align:start position:0%
hampshire driver's license non-real id
license

01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
my concern only is that when this
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
committee makes its decision it be well
 
01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:18.790 align:start position:0%
committee makes its decision it be well
informed

01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
informed
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
and that you fully
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
understand which groups of people who
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
now cannot get either a real id or a new
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%

01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
allowing to get under this bill
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
i don't understand this well enough to
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
um to give you an opinion but i do know
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
this is complicated enough that you
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
really need to get some expert advice on
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
this before you go forward with the bill
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%

02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
through this committee
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
a number of times
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i keep going back to
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%

02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:34.390 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and supporting our law
enforcement

02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
i know there are other states that don't
 
02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:36.790 align:start position:0%
i know there are other states that don't
have

02:15:36.790 --> 02:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
the front plate requirement
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
however when i hear from
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
the police association the chiefs of
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
police hollis farmington
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
the state police
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
the dmv
 
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
and the concerns about toll collection
 
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
which we didn't exactly get into
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
specifics of the public hearing
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
but the most recent information that
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
i've heard um is that there's about 40
 
02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:04.709 align:start position:0%
i've heard um is that there's about 40
of

02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:16:06.310 --> 02:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
unpaid tolls
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
due to lack of reading the front plates
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that we find this bill
 
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
for those reasons
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
but i also have an issue with the
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
verbiage of collectibility
 
02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
um historic character and the ambiguity
 
02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill on how that's supposed to be
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
determined thank you
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else
 
02:16:33.589 --> 02:16:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative o'hara
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and yeah i'm a
 
02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
huge supporter of
 
02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the front license plate
 
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
but hearing that testimony from the
 
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
police did kind of change my mind on
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
that for now
 
02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anybody else
 
02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative erosion
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
i intend to vote
 
02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
against the prevailing motion
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
we have many
 
02:17:03.439 --> 02:17:05.110 align:start position:0%
we have many
drivers

02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
in vehicles that come to the state of
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire from other states that
 
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
don't require
 
02:17:11.589 --> 02:17:11.599 align:start position:0%
a front license plate and it's a
 
02:17:11.599 --> 02:17:13.830 align:start position:0%
a front license plate and it's a
non-event

02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
non-event
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
think the the some of the uh
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
easy pass can have cameras that
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
can pick up the rear plate
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
as many of you know we have scanning
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
devices that law enforcement use to get
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
the plate number
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
further the uh
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
during night time operation of the
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
vehicle that front plate's not lit
 
02:17:37.519 --> 02:17:38.790 align:start position:0%
vehicle that front plate's not lit
so

02:17:38.790 --> 02:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
if this was such an important
 
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
thing to have
 
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
i would think by now somebody would have
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
presented legislation to
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
to light up the front plate
 
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
so it's a good
 
02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
half of the time particular time of the
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
year you you can't even see it
 
02:17:59.910 --> 02:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i think there's some good reasons to
 
02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
allow it and um
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
we've we've heard some of these items
 
02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:07.599 align:start position:0%
before for the reason to be against it
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
but i i don't think i think if we're
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
really worried about it we would we
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
would have a policy that would require
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
other states when they
 
02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know other drivers from out of state
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
when they come here to new hampshire to
 
02:18:21.669 --> 02:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
display a plate so um it can't be that
 
02:18:23.589 --> 02:18:23.599 align:start position:0%
big of a problem thanks
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'll just point out first this must be
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
sub day great what
 
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes i'm subbing here so i just want to
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
point out though an issue that comes up
 
02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
all the time in um
 
02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:39.669 align:start position:0%
all the time in um
in

02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
in in all committees is this does
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
require a
 
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
new fee and that's why it's an early
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
bill but also requires hiring a due
 
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
state employee so i know there's
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
many members of the house who are um
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
very skeptical about any new fee and
 
02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
also hiring any new state employees and
 
02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
this bill requires both some
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
i plan to vote for the ital on its
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
merits but that's another just
 
02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll ask the clerk to call
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%

hearing last week the prime sponsor did
 
02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
not show up because it was a decal bill
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
um we did the necessary check thing

check the 501c3 status
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%

02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
support of the sponsor we can then go on

adopted 18-0
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%

02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
current motion about to pass
 
02:23:48.479 --> 02:23:49.190 align:start position:0%
current motion about to pass
back

02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:52.309 align:start position:0%
on the floor
um

02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
anybody cared to speak to the motion of
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:00.630 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

02:24:00.630 --> 02:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
we can't just make a separate we're
 
02:24:02.399 --> 02:24:03.910 align:start position:0%
we can't just make a separate we're
reconsidering

02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
reconsidering
 
02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
no what we're going to have to do
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
the motion to reconsider was one action
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
and so now
 
02:24:11.429 --> 02:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
by rules we have to
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
take up the state the motion on the
 
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
floor which is ought to pass yeah turn
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
it down
 
02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
if that's our wishes yeah and then make
 
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
another motion to to round it off just
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
trying to be clear about it thank you
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
yes it is going to be three votes
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
well i
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
unless we say ought to pass again but i
 
02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
so did you care to speak to this motion
 
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
i would thank you thank you thank you
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
very much um just to explain what
 
02:24:37.439 --> 02:24:38.550 align:start position:0%
very much um just to explain what
happened

02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
with this uh bill um
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
i reached out to the prime sponsor to
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
inquire as to why she wasn't here to
 
02:24:45.359 --> 02:24:46.389 align:start position:0%
inquire as to why she wasn't here to
present

02:24:46.389 --> 02:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
it was a scheduling mix-up but that
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what she did point out
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
was that the organization that's named
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
02:24:53.439 --> 02:24:54.469 align:start position:0%
in this bill
actually

02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:24:57.270 --> 02:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
um reached out to her
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
the week prior and said that they would
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
like to politely decline the offer of
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
being part of the multi-use decal
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
bill plate program
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
um i question that
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
the uh prime sponsor then uh looked a
 
02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
little further into it and i think that
 
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
what she found is probably useful
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
information for all of us as we get
 
02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
these bills in the future
 
02:25:23.349 --> 02:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
the organization looked at the list of
 
02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
non-profits that are approved in statute
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
one of them is the harris science center
 
02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
which i believe we
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
passed my first term maybe 2019
 
02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
and they reached out and said how do you
 
02:25:35.910 --> 02:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
like the program
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
and the harris science center said it's
 
02:25:39.750 --> 02:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
the biggest mistake we've ever made as
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
an organization
 
02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:42.870 align:start position:0%
an organization
they

02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
went through the process filled out the
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork said it was quite onerous
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
they spent the money to produce the
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
decals that fit the specifications of
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
the program
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
then they
 
02:25:58.389 --> 02:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
tried to sell them
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the course of three years they have
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
sold 12 decals
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
the organization is in the red over a
 
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for this program
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
some of the things that they brought up
 
02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:10.389 align:start position:0%
some of the things that they brought up
was

02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
people are very attached to their plates
 
02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
their moose plates their state park
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
plates their vanity plates they don't
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
want to have to
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
trade them in
 
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
then go get the new decal plate and then
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
buy the sticker
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
so for all these oh they all she also
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
said that for these science
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
environmental programs they are directly
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
in conflict with everyone who loves the
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
moose plates and the state park plates
 
02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:36.150 align:start position:0%
moose plates and the state park plates
so

02:26:36.150 --> 02:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
at the request of the prime sponsor
 
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you vote down
 
02:26:43.349 --> 02:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
the otp motion that's still on the floor
 
02:26:46.389 --> 02:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
and so that another motion can be made
 
02:26:48.790 --> 02:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
but i also think as a committee we need
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
to keep this information in mind as
 
02:26:54.070 --> 02:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
these organizations come to us
 
02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
i truly wonder if some sponsors
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
understand what's involved with the
 
02:26:58.319 --> 02:26:59.349 align:start position:0%
understand what's involved with the
program

02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
that money is needed
 
02:27:02.790 --> 02:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
to be put up front that there's a lot of
 
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
paperwork involved
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i think for some organizations it's
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
a great program the
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
university system of new hampshire has
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
the the means the numbers the the
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to handle it um i believe the
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
girl scouts that we heard last week does
 
02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:20.710 align:start position:0%
girl scouts that we heard last week does
also

02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:27:22.469 --> 02:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
but for some smaller organizations this
 
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
is definitely not a program for them so
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
with that i would be voting against the
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
otp that's on the floor and encourage
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
the otp is automatic on the floor
 
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
because once we've reconsidered we go to
 
02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
the original motion
 
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
so right now it's otp
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh that might be well good
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
advice for some of the smaller
 
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
organizations in the future um there was
 
02:27:53.670 --> 02:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
valuable information so the motion on
 
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
the floor is ought to pass once again on
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 1060.
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'll ask the clerk to call the roll once
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
soon as she's ready
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%

02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
public hearings this afternoon and an
 
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:01.429 --> 03:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
all right i'd like to open up
 
03:35:03.510 --> 03:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
the transportation house session on
 
03:35:04.750 --> 03:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
1666 fn
 
03:35:11.190 --> 03:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
first up would be the prime sponsor
 
03:35:21.190 --> 03:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:23.190 --> 03:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
chairman gagne and members of the
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
transportation committee thank you for
 
03:35:27.429 --> 03:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
allowing me to introduce
 
03:35:31.510 --> 03:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
this bill house bill 1666.
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i would like to
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
bring to the attention of the committee
 
03:35:35.910 --> 03:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:35:39.750 --> 03:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
in my mind and i think in yours too
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
a primary purpose of the legislature is
 
03:35:44.070 --> 03:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
to fix problems for the residents of
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
this state where problems exist if
 
03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
they're within
 
03:35:51.429 --> 03:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
our purview and they can be fixed
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
so this bill is trying to look at
 
03:35:56.710 --> 03:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
a problem of
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
public safety that's what i want to
 
03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
emphasize again and again and again
 
03:36:05.349 --> 03:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is about public safety
 
03:36:07.190 --> 03:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
whether we
 
03:36:09.030 --> 03:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
like it or not
 
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
there are people who drive in this state
 
03:36:14.070 --> 03:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
who do not who are do not have a
 
03:36:15.910 --> 03:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
03:36:18.070 --> 03:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
and in some instances they are
 
03:36:22.150 --> 03:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.469 --> 03:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
the public safety angle of this is if
 
03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to drive
 
03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's better from a public safety point
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
of view for
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
us to know
 
03:36:31.750 --> 03:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
who they are
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
where they live
 
03:36:35.590 --> 03:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
and if they're competent drivers
 
03:36:37.269 --> 03:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
this bill would require
 
03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
anybody who's qualifies otherwise
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
to take the written exam
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
and the practical exam before any
 
03:36:47.190 --> 03:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
license would be issued because driving
 
03:36:50.950 --> 03:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
is a privilege and we recognize that
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
the other part of this that i would like
 
03:36:52.880 --> 03:36:53.830 align:start position:0%
the other part of this that i would like
to

03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
point out is
 
03:36:57.190 --> 03:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
03:36:59.510 --> 03:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
many police departments and public
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
safety agencies are trying to accomplish
 
03:37:02.950 --> 03:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
03:37:05.750 --> 03:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
is to have a more active presence in
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
what they
 
03:37:08.070 --> 03:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
typically call
 
03:37:10.469 --> 03:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
community policing
 
03:37:12.229 --> 03:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
to do that you have to connect with the
 
03:37:12.239 --> 03:37:13.590 align:start position:0%
to do that you have to connect with the
community

03:37:13.590 --> 03:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
and if you have a segment of people who
 
03:37:17.590 --> 03:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
live in your community who are afraid
 
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
03:37:21.670 --> 03:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
to interact with the police that's not
 
03:37:24.229 --> 03:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
healthy or helpful
 
03:37:24.239 --> 03:37:25.269 align:start position:0%
healthy or helpful
so

03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:25.279 --> 03:37:27.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
for those reasons and many more
 
03:37:30.720 --> 03:37:31.990 align:start position:0%
for those reasons and many more
i've

03:37:31.990 --> 03:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
i've
 
03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
put this bill in the other thing i would
 
03:37:37.910 --> 03:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
point out to you as well is that
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
in talking to various public safety
 
03:37:40.720 --> 03:37:42.950 align:start position:0%
in talking to various public safety
organizations

03:37:42.950 --> 03:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
they have begun to recognize that this
 
03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:46.150 align:start position:0%
they have begun to recognize that this
is

03:37:46.150 --> 03:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:37:49.030 --> 03:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
an important constituency that they want
 
03:37:50.790 --> 03:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
to connect with because they can tell
 
03:37:50.800 --> 03:37:51.670 align:start position:0%
to connect with because they can tell
them

03:37:51.670 --> 03:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:37:53.349 --> 03:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
about things that are happening in their
 
03:37:53.359 --> 03:37:55.030 align:start position:0%
about things that are happening in their
community

03:37:55.030 --> 03:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
the other thing is there's probably
 
03:37:59.670 --> 03:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
the numbers are very i can't provide the
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
documentation but it's thought to be at
 
03:38:04.229 --> 03:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
least fifteen thousand undocumented
 
03:38:07.750 --> 03:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:07.760 --> 03:38:09.349 align:start position:0%
 
finally

03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
finally
 
03:38:11.590 --> 03:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
we are not
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
creating new ground here
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
and i say that because there are the
 
03:38:18.150 --> 03:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
last time i checked
 
03:38:19.990 --> 03:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
and please don't hold me to this exact
 
03:38:22.150 --> 03:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
number but i believe there are
 
03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
at least 15 states that have programs
 
03:38:26.469 --> 03:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
like this
 
03:38:28.710 --> 03:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
where they're trying to get everybody
 
03:38:28.720 --> 03:38:31.670 align:start position:0%
where they're trying to get everybody
licensed

03:38:31.670 --> 03:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:33.990 --> 03:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
two of the nearest ones are vermont and
 
03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
while new york is not contiguous with us
 
03:38:38.229 --> 03:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
new york also
 
03:38:40.550 --> 03:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
they allow undocumented persons to go
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
through a process
 
03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
that proves that they are safe community
 
03:38:45.359 --> 03:38:46.710 align:start position:0%
that proves that they are safe community
drivers

03:38:46.710 --> 03:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
03:38:48.710 --> 03:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
with this kind of documentation some
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
other pieces can fall into place
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
they can for instance get car insurance
 
03:38:57.600 --> 03:38:58.469 align:start position:0%
they can for instance get car insurance
that's

03:38:58.469 --> 03:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:39:01.590 --> 03:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
really helpful for many many people so i
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
would urge you to have an open mind
 
03:39:03.840 --> 03:39:04.790 align:start position:0%
would urge you to have an open mind
about

03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:39:06.790 --> 03:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
what problem it is that we're trying to
 
03:39:09.429 --> 03:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
fix and that problem is that we have a a
 
03:39:11.269 --> 03:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
segment of population driving in the
 
03:39:13.189 --> 03:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
state who have not proven that they are
 
03:39:13.199 --> 03:39:14.870 align:start position:0%
state who have not proven that they are
safe

03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
safe
 
03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
responsible drivers and we would like to
 
03:39:19.429 --> 03:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
bring them in the fold so that that can
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
be shown
 
03:39:24.309 --> 03:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
and without take any questions if i can
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'll answer any questions any questions
 
03:39:29.670 --> 03:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:42.469 --> 03:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:45.510 --> 03:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
next up is grace kendecki i think i
 
03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
pronounced that correctly i hope
 
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
can decay
 
03:39:48.960 --> 03:40:05.830 align:start position:0%
can decay
okay

03:40:05.830 --> 03:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.590 --> 03:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
here we go okay thank you
 
03:40:09.189 --> 03:40:09.199 align:start position:0%

my name is grace candecke i'm the
 
03:40:14.229 --> 03:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
program coordinator for the american
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
friends service committee and so i come
 
03:40:17.910 --> 03:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
here with a testimony that i will also
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
submit to the committee and i will pray
 
03:40:21.429 --> 03:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
our phrase from the immigrant rights
 
03:40:24.309 --> 03:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
network a group of passionate activists
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
organ and organizations that we can that
 
03:40:28.710 --> 03:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
afsc convenes
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
we strongly urge the committee to pass
 
03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
hb 1666 if passed this bill would allow
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
members of our community who are
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
undocumented to be able to drive without
 
03:40:41.189 --> 03:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
a license
 
03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
and to drive with a license i apologize
 
03:40:45.429 --> 03:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
the bill has the support of many law
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement leaders as well as members
 
03:40:49.510 --> 03:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
of the immigrant communities as well as
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
advocacy and faith groups and it is time
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
for our state to join the growing number
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
of jurisdictions across the country that
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
have concluded that licensing
 
03:41:00.309 --> 03:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
undocumented drivers would be beneficial
 
03:41:02.790 --> 03:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
to the state and to all of the residents
 
03:41:05.429 --> 03:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
these benefits include removal of an
 
03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burden on law enforcement
 
03:41:09.990 --> 03:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
and our criminal legal system because
 
03:41:11.510 --> 03:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
operating without a license in new
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire is currently a criminal
 
03:41:15.110 --> 03:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
offense and oftentimes for undocumented
 
03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
members of our community it is the one
 
03:41:19.269 --> 03:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
criminal offense that they are liable
 
03:41:19.279 --> 03:41:20.389 align:start position:0%
criminal offense that they are liable
for

03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:41:22.309 --> 03:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
it is unnecessary to burden law
 
03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the entire criminal
 
03:41:26.150 --> 03:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
legal system by criminalizing conduct
 
03:41:28.710 --> 03:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
that could be legalized by expanding
 
03:41:31.830 --> 03:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
expanding licensing eligibility
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
another benefit includes increased
 
03:41:35.269 --> 03:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
public safety
 
03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
because undocumented in new hampshire
 
03:41:39.510 --> 03:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
residents are not currently eligible for
 
03:41:41.830 --> 03:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses there is no systematic
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
operator or respect of this group of
 
03:41:43.840 --> 03:41:44.870 align:start position:0%
operator or respect of this group of
people

03:41:44.870 --> 03:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
permitting this group this population to
 
03:41:49.269 --> 03:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
be able to drive
 
03:41:51.030 --> 03:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
would benefit not only them but their
 
03:41:53.670 --> 03:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
families as well as the state it would
 
03:41:53.680 --> 03:41:54.950 align:start position:0%
families as well as the state it would
actively

03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
actively
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
it would positively identify the driver
 
03:42:00.150 --> 03:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
it would more effectively regulate motor
 
03:42:02.790 --> 03:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle operators it would be a safer to
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
operate vehicles on our roads and it
 
03:42:06.550 --> 03:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
would as um
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative sykes said it would
 
03:42:11.269 --> 03:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
increase insured drivers on our roadways
 
03:42:11.279 --> 03:42:12.870 align:start position:0%
increase insured drivers on our roadways
so

03:42:12.870 --> 03:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
being an undocumented immigrant is not a
 
03:42:17.110 --> 03:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
criminal offense although it is a
 
03:42:19.189 --> 03:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
federal misdemeanor to enter the united
 
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
states without permission the majority
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
of people unlawfully present here are
 
03:42:24.870 --> 03:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
those who entered with the visa and
 
03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
remained after the visas expired they
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
have built their families they have many
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
of them are working are supporting their
 
03:42:32.309 --> 03:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
families and their communities and
 
03:42:34.469 --> 03:42:34.479 align:start position:0%
enabling them to be able to drive
 
03:42:36.150 --> 03:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
especially in the state of new hampshire
 
03:42:38.229 --> 03:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
where a car is so necessary is
 
03:42:40.630 --> 03:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
critically important
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants are part of this
 
03:42:44.309 --> 03:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
community they contribute to our way of
 
03:42:46.950 --> 03:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
life to our economy to our schools in
 
03:42:48.870 --> 03:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
our workplaces
 
03:42:51.670 --> 03:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
by decreasing the fear between our
 
03:42:53.590 --> 03:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
undocumented populations as well as with
 
03:42:55.510 --> 03:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement it creates a
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
community that is much more able to
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
effectively address the larger issues
 
03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
that are needed to be addressed in order
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
for people to feel that they can move
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
safely and work safely in the state
 
03:43:09.910 --> 03:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
so i urge you all to please to pass this
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
bill because of the benefits that it
 
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
would have for our community
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
for our popular undocumented immigrants
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the state as well as for unburdening
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
the criminal legal system thank you
 
03:43:22.150 --> 03:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
03:43:23.830 --> 03:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:43:25.189 --> 03:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
for the witness
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
yeah representative thompson
 
03:43:30.389 --> 03:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon miami thank you for
 
03:43:30.399 --> 03:43:32.830 align:start position:0%
good afternoon miami thank you for
testifying

03:43:32.830 --> 03:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
03:43:36.070 --> 03:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
um i think what you're asking us to do
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
is to legalize
 
03:43:40.229 --> 03:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
someone who's already illegal to begin
 
03:43:40.239 --> 03:43:41.830 align:start position:0%
someone who's already illegal to begin
with

03:43:41.830 --> 03:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
and i i'm sorry but i can't i don't
 
03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
grasp the
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:52.710 --> 03:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how to phrase the question
 
03:43:55.349 --> 03:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
but yeah it is a question if you're here
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
illegally for us to legalize a driver's
 
03:44:00.309 --> 03:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
license for you
 
03:44:00.319 --> 03:44:01.590 align:start position:0%
license for you
gives

03:44:01.590 --> 03:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
gives
 
03:44:03.590 --> 03:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
i would think the state some sort of
 
03:44:03.600 --> 03:44:07.349 align:start position:0%
i would think the state some sort of
liability

03:44:07.349 --> 03:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:09.990 --> 03:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
03:44:14.830 --> 03:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.830 --> 03:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
true is that working now all right
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question no that is
 
03:44:22.150 --> 03:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
not true what the this bill would allow
 
03:44:24.790 --> 03:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
is it would it would systematize being
 
03:44:27.349 --> 03:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
able to give people driver's licenses so
 
03:44:28.870 --> 03:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
it would give people the ability to

03:44:35.910 --> 03:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
not offer legal status it does not offer

public safety all across new hampshire
 
03:46:55.359 --> 03:46:56.630 align:start position:0%
public safety all across new hampshire
communities

03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:46:58.389 --> 03:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
allowing people to obtain driver's
 
03:47:00.389 --> 03:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
licenses while they are awaiting the
 
03:47:03.590 --> 03:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
outcome of legal filings court cases or
 
03:47:06.070 --> 03:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
adjustment of immigration status
 
03:47:08.150 --> 03:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
will greatly decrease the fear of law
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement in immigrant communities
 
03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
many encounters with new hampshire law
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers occur within the
 
03:47:18.550 --> 03:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
context of motor vehicle activities
 
03:47:20.710 --> 03:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
therefore many immigrants including
 
03:47:23.590 --> 03:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
those legally present fear and avoid
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
contact with law enforcement
 
03:47:28.950 --> 03:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
this may lead to unreported crimes
 
03:47:31.349 --> 03:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
failure to appear as a witness or a
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
defendant in court and other
 
03:47:35.429 --> 03:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
consequences that affect a community's
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
quality of life
 
03:47:40.389 --> 03:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
i personally have a friend in manchester
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
named susan who was brought here as a
 
03:47:45.269 --> 03:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
child by her parents grew up here
 
03:47:48.070 --> 03:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
married a legal resident here had
 
03:47:50.790 --> 03:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
children and was driving her child to
 
03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
her dance lesson in goffstown one night
 
03:47:56.710 --> 03:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
when an illegal left turn resulted in a
 
03:47:58.229 --> 03:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
police stop
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
what should have been simply a ticket or
 
03:48:02.790 --> 03:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
a warning became a nightmare for this
 
03:48:06.070 --> 03:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
family as susan was taken to immigrant
 
03:48:06.080 --> 03:48:07.189 align:start position:0%
family as susan was taken to immigrant
detention

03:48:07.189 --> 03:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
detention
 
03:48:10.229 --> 03:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
for two weeks leaving her family
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
alone her children traumatized and those
 
03:48:15.189 --> 03:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
children still today are terrified when
 
03:48:17.429 --> 03:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
they see a police officer
 
03:48:19.429 --> 03:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
she's back at home now but the trauma
 
03:48:19.439 --> 03:48:20.950 align:start position:0%
she's back at home now but the trauma
lingers

03:48:20.950 --> 03:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
lingers
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
the wait times for processing most
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
immigration applications have increased
 
03:48:27.510 --> 03:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
and people who have applied for lawful
 
03:48:27.520 --> 03:48:28.550 align:start position:0%
and people who have applied for lawful
status

03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
status
 
03:48:30.309 --> 03:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
may have to wait months and sometimes
 
03:48:32.389 --> 03:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
years depending on the type of petition
 
03:48:34.469 --> 03:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
they have filed for adjudication of
 
03:48:35.990 --> 03:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
their application
 
03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to drive lawfully during
 
03:48:39.990 --> 03:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
this waiting period would decrease
 
03:48:42.229 --> 03:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
stress and fear for families with loved
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
ones awaiting approval of a lawful
 
03:48:44.640 --> 03:48:46.229 align:start position:0%
ones awaiting approval of a lawful
status

03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
status
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
additionally studies show that licensed
 
03:48:50.950 --> 03:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
drivers are safer drivers and are more
 
03:48:53.269 --> 03:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
likely to purchase auto insurance
 
03:48:55.030 --> 03:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
this will make our streets and highways
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
safer for everyone
 
03:48:59.030 --> 03:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
in closing if you are worried that
 
03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
possession of a driver's license would
 
03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
lead to ineligible people voting or
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
accessing state services
 
03:49:07.590 --> 03:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
please be aware
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
that a driver's license does not confer
 
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
the right to vote or establish
 
03:49:14.950 --> 03:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility for any state or federal
 
03:49:14.960 --> 03:49:16.150 align:start position:0%
eligibility for any state or federal
benefit

03:49:16.150 --> 03:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
03:49:18.150 --> 03:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
eligibility to register to vote in new
 
03:49:20.790 --> 03:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire is based on u.s citizenship
 
03:49:22.630 --> 03:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
age and domicile
 
03:49:24.870 --> 03:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
each state and federal benefits program
 
03:49:27.189 --> 03:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
is highly regulated and sets out
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility standards in their
 
03:49:31.349 --> 03:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
regulations and none of these standards
 
03:49:33.110 --> 03:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
are tied to the possession of a driver's
 
03:49:33.120 --> 03:49:34.309 align:start position:0%
are tied to the possession of a driver's
license

03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:49:36.630 --> 03:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration i urge
 
03:49:39.670 --> 03:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
you to support house bill 1666
 
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions and i do
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
have a copy for the clerk
 
03:49:45.510 --> 03:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for both any questions for
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
this committee from this representative
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
telersky thank you mr chairman thank you
 
03:49:51.429 --> 03:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:49:51.439 --> 03:49:53.910 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

03:49:53.910 --> 03:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:56.309 --> 03:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
last year when we heard a similar bill
 
03:50:00.150 --> 03:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
i recall uh my own police chief
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
who's since retired michael carrigan
 
03:50:05.510 --> 03:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
from nashua testified in support and he
 
03:50:08.070 --> 03:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
brought up the importance of
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:14.950 --> 03:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
community policing excuse me
 
03:50:16.870 --> 03:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
and what struck me and you touched on it
 
03:50:18.469 --> 03:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering if you can expand on a
 
03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
little bit more is that many crimes go
 
03:50:23.590 --> 03:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
unreported including sexual assaults
 
03:50:23.600 --> 03:50:25.590 align:start position:0%
unreported including sexual assaults
um

03:50:25.590 --> 03:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:27.349 --> 03:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know robberies attacks anything like
 
03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
that can you just expand on on how this
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
one uh document can help improve the
 
03:50:34.319 --> 03:50:35.590 align:start position:0%
one uh document can help improve the
trust

03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
trust
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
of people with the system
 
03:50:40.229 --> 03:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and yes
 
03:50:42.150 --> 03:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
we've worked extensively with manchester
 
03:50:44.070 --> 03:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
and nashua police departments and and
 
03:50:47.590 --> 03:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
many police officers do support
 
03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
this idea
 
03:50:52.550 --> 03:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know it can be standard procedure
 
03:50:55.110 --> 03:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
for an officer to ask for id when
 
03:50:56.950 --> 03:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
responding to a call
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
and even if i'm a citizen
 
03:51:01.510 --> 03:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
if my husband is not whether he's an
 
03:51:04.229 --> 03:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
asylum seeker whether he's applied for
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of status but if he doesn't
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
have a driver's license i'm going to be
 
03:51:10.710 --> 03:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
afraid to call the police into my home
 
03:51:12.150 --> 03:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
because the police will ask for
 
03:51:12.160 --> 03:51:13.670 align:start position:0%
because the police will ask for
identification

03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
identification
 
03:51:17.349 --> 03:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
and then the police may call
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
customs and immigration enforcement and
 
03:51:23.750 --> 03:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
it may result in time in jail so
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:28.560 --> 03:51:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
representation

03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
representation
 
03:51:32.469 --> 03:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you man for
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
taking the question you indicated in
 
03:51:37.189 --> 03:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
your testimony that um
 
03:51:39.910 --> 03:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
drivers are more likely to purchase car
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
insurance uh when they have a driver's
 
03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:43.269 align:start position:0%
insurance uh when they have a driver's
license

03:51:43.269 --> 03:51:43.279 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
do you have a
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
could you supply the committee with a
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
copy of a report that uh that shows that
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
i can find it yes i can thank you thank
 
03:51:53.590 --> 03:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your question
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions um
 
03:51:57.750 --> 03:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
i keep forgetting your name i'm sorry
 
03:52:00.150 --> 03:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay i'm that's i'm representative
 
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
schultz but i'm also friendly so it's
 
03:52:02.560 --> 03:52:03.429 align:start position:0%
schultz but i'm also friendly so it's
okay

03:52:03.429 --> 03:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:52:03.439 --> 03:52:04.389 align:start position:0%
okay
um

03:52:04.389 --> 03:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
did you know that to get car insurance
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
you typically need a driver's license
 
03:52:12.710 --> 03:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
and to submit the copies
 
03:52:14.790 --> 03:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
for your driver's license yes you can't
 
03:52:16.229 --> 03:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
get car insurance for the most part
 
03:52:18.070 --> 03:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
unless you have a driver's license so
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's why i believe that we would all
 
03:52:21.990 --> 03:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
be safer if we're not if we have uh
 
03:52:23.670 --> 03:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
reduce our chance of getting um
 
03:52:25.750 --> 03:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
interactions with uninsured drivers yes
 
03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:31.510 --> 03:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else from the committee
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you and you can just
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:43.030 --> 03:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
just watch your step
 
03:52:46.790 --> 03:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:48.790 --> 03:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
no there's more than one car here take
 
03:52:48.800 --> 03:52:51.590 align:start position:0%
no there's more than one car here take
that

03:52:51.590 --> 03:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
and pass that down if you like you like
 
03:53:06.309 --> 03:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:09.189 --> 03:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
next up is
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%

to help the immigrants here about the
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
immigrants so that's a happen
 
03:55:06.070 --> 03:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
when the people have opportunity to have
 
03:55:08.229 --> 03:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
a driving license here if you i don't
 
03:55:11.670 --> 03:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity so it's like every
 
03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
immigrant lives here all money they can
 
03:55:16.469 --> 03:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
meet at they're going to send out of the
 
03:55:17.670 --> 03:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
country they're going to invest in
 
03:55:19.269 --> 03:55:19.279 align:start position:0%
another country if the money is going to
 
03:55:20.870 --> 03:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
get out here because the immigrants is
 
03:55:22.469 --> 03:55:22.479 align:start position:0%
still here but when they have
 
03:55:25.030 --> 03:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to have a son like a
 
03:55:27.030 --> 03:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
driver license they're going to get a
 
03:55:29.349 --> 03:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
different mind they're gonna be saved in
 
03:55:31.110 --> 03:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
this country if they're gonna invest
 
03:55:34.150 --> 03:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
here for hard job but then they do it so
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's it's myself example then i did
 
03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
during 30 years here so that's
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
everything then i have to talk about it
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
03:55:45.110 --> 03:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
03:55:47.830 --> 03:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:05.030 --> 03:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a stab at this one
 
03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:13.110 --> 03:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:23.110 --> 03:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee my
 
03:56:24.550 --> 03:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
name is frank knack i'm the policy
 
03:56:27.750 --> 03:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
director with the aclu of new hampshire
 
03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
i have my colleague jill bisonette i
 
03:56:31.110 --> 03:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
believe emailed the committee copies of
 
03:56:32.710 --> 03:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
his testimony on this bill and i have
 
03:56:34.070 --> 03:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
hard copies with the chair's permission
 
03:56:35.349 --> 03:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
to hand out
 
03:56:37.510 --> 03:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
after after my testimony
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
most of our points have already been
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
covered so i don't want to repeat what's
 
03:56:42.469 --> 03:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
already been said um you know i think in
 
03:56:43.990 --> 03:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
general as you've heard from a public
 
03:56:46.550 --> 03:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
safety standpoint both from a roadside
 
03:56:48.469 --> 03:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
from a road safety perspective and also
 
03:56:50.389 --> 03:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
from a strengthening community police
 
03:56:50.399 --> 03:56:52.229 align:start position:0%
from a strengthening community police
trust

03:56:52.229 --> 03:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
trust
 
03:56:54.150 --> 03:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea and a really
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
positive ability i think there was a
 
03:56:56.870 --> 03:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
question around the number of states
 
03:56:58.950 --> 03:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
that have implemented this thus far and
 
03:57:00.870 --> 03:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
through our research we found 16 states
 
03:57:04.070 --> 03:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
plus the district of columbia
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
do not
 
03:57:06.870 --> 03:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
limit the ability to get a driver's
 
03:57:09.990 --> 03:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
license based off of immigration status
 
03:57:11.830 --> 03:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
and then again just from a you know
 
03:57:13.990 --> 03:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
basic human decency recognition of the
 
03:57:15.590 --> 03:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
practicalities of living in a rural
 
03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
state like new hampshire
 
03:57:19.750 --> 03:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
it driver's license is necessary to
 
03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
survive in our state you know as you all
 
03:57:23.670 --> 03:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
know to get to school to get to work to
 
03:57:25.830 --> 03:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
get to the doctor's office
 
03:57:28.229 --> 03:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
you need to get on the roads and so
 
03:57:29.990 --> 03:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
ensuring that all folks in our state
 
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
have the ability and access to do that
 
03:57:33.510 --> 03:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
and to do so lawfully we think is
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
important and so this is a really
 
03:57:36.550 --> 03:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
positive bill and we hope the committee
 
03:57:40.150 --> 03:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
will will support it so thank you
 
03:57:43.429 --> 03:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
 
03:57:43.439 --> 03:57:44.469 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
witness

03:57:44.469 --> 03:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
witness
 
03:57:46.870 --> 03:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none you can hand that right to
 
03:57:50.070 --> 03:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
that lady here and make sure the clerk

04:06:30.550 --> 04:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
up at a hearing in the immigration court
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
in addition uh there is a study
 
04:06:38.830 --> 04:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
conducted and published in
 
04:06:38.840 --> 04:06:40.550 align:start position:0%
conducted and published in
2019

04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
2019
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
called the marshall project
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
showing that there is no correlation
 
04:06:46.399 --> 04:06:47.910 align:start position:0%
showing that there is no correlation
whatsoever

04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
04:06:47.920 --> 04:06:49.189 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
between

04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
growing in a particular area and crimes
 
04:06:59.349 --> 04:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
also growing in the in the area
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
so the state showed that even though
 
04:07:04.150 --> 04:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
there had been an increase of
 
04:07:04.160 --> 04:07:05.910 align:start position:0%
there had been an increase of
undocumented

04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
undocumented
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
immigrants in the nashua metro area
 
04:07:11.110 --> 04:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
which also includes manchester
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh the the crimes actually remained the
 
04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
same and we're talking about property uh
 
04:07:19.830 --> 04:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know crimes against property and
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:24.000 --> 04:07:24.250 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:07:24.250 --> 04:07:24.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:07:24.260 --> 04:07:25.910 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
we um
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
so the threat is not really you know
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
like what we think it is
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh since to 2019
 
04:07:36.790 --> 04:07:36.800 align:start position:0%

04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh reports showing that the actual
 
04:07:47.110 --> 04:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
threat to our national security our

so continuing
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh immigrants are not allowed to to vote
 
04:09:05.189 --> 04:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:09:08.389 --> 04:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
in order to to be eligible to vote and i
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
as my colleague sarah jane have stated
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
the person has to to prove their age
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
their citizenship
 
04:09:20.469 --> 04:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
they must be a u.s citizen
 
04:09:22.630 --> 04:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
and show residency
 
04:09:25.030 --> 04:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the state otherwise they're not
 
04:09:27.030 --> 04:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote
 
04:09:29.670 --> 04:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
once they
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
they can prove that they can register
 
04:09:32.159 --> 04:09:33.030 align:start position:0%
they can prove that they can register
with

04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:09:36.550 --> 04:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office in their town or city
 
04:09:40.469 --> 04:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh and then their names are get entered
 
04:09:40.479 --> 04:09:41.429 align:start position:0%
uh and then their names are get entered
into

04:09:41.429 --> 04:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:09:43.189 --> 04:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
a roster
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's when uh someone
 
04:09:48.790 --> 04:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
that we go to to the polls and then we
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
cast our votes but we can only do that
 
04:09:54.870 --> 04:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
if our names are in the tally you can
 
04:09:57.030 --> 04:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
show your driver's license
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
if you are not u.s citizen as a matter
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
of fact we have many permanent residents
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
in the state green card holders that do
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
have a driver's license person who
 
04:10:10.149 --> 04:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
persons who are not green card holders
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
that do have a driver's license and we
 
04:10:15.269 --> 04:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
haven't had a history
 
04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
of any of these individuals voting in
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
um as a matter of fact
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
it can be
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
um it can be a very serious um
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
crime not crime but offense and actually
 
04:10:35.349 --> 04:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
permanently bar someone from getting
 
04:10:38.309 --> 04:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
any immigration benefit later on if they
 
04:10:40.950 --> 04:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
vote when they're not allowed as a
 
04:10:44.469 --> 04:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
matter of fact i have provided um a
 
04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
guide of
 
04:10:48.710 --> 04:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
the laws mr chair
 
04:10:50.710 --> 04:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
that shows the types of
 
04:10:53.030 --> 04:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
crimes and one of them
 
04:10:57.670 --> 04:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
is voting when you're not authorized
 
04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
so the other issue that has constantly
 
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
been brought up is that immigrants are
 
04:11:02.880 --> 04:11:04.389 align:start position:0%
been brought up is that immigrants are
important

04:11:04.389 --> 04:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:11:06.309 --> 04:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
to the state and they cost a lot of
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
money to to the state and this country
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh that is untrue
 
04:11:12.870 --> 04:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh in new hampshire we have
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 000 undocumented
 
04:11:16.319 --> 04:11:17.590 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 000 undocumented
immigrants

04:11:17.590 --> 04:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
these immigrants are not eligible to
 
04:11:22.710 --> 04:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
apply for any government assistance such
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
as wic food stamps etc
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
in addition these immigrants they have
 
04:11:34.070 --> 04:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:36.630 --> 04:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars in federal and state
 
04:11:36.640 --> 04:11:37.670 align:start position:0%
million dollars in federal and state
taxes

04:11:37.670 --> 04:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
with a household income
 
04:11:39.840 --> 04:11:42.189 align:start position:0%
with a household income
of

04:11:42.189 --> 04:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
595.4 million dollars
 
04:11:45.439 --> 04:11:46.389 align:start position:0%
595.4 million dollars
into

04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
04:11:51.750 --> 04:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
i have also provided um
 
04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh on tab d uh the the study
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
in general uh in the state we have uh 87
 
04:12:01.840 --> 04:12:04.309 align:start position:0%
in general uh in the state we have uh 87
05

04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
05
 
04:12:04.319 --> 04:12:05.590 align:start position:0%
05
immigrants

04:12:05.590 --> 04:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh who have paid 1.1 billion dollars in
 
04:12:10.159 --> 04:12:11.269 align:start position:0%
uh who have paid 1.1 billion dollars in
taxes

04:12:11.269 --> 04:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
with a 3 billion dollar expanding power
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
amongst these immigrants
 
04:12:20.229 --> 04:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
do you know which country is the most
 
04:12:20.239 --> 04:12:21.429 align:start position:0%
do you know which country is the most
populous

04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
populous
 
04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh between undocumented and undocumented
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
immigrants in the state
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
you are correct canadians i'm sure some
 
04:12:33.510 --> 04:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
of you might have thought mexicans but
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:37.520 --> 04:12:38.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:40.469 --> 04:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
and the other issue is that immigrants
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
don't pay taxes as i have just mentioned
 
04:12:45.510 --> 04:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
they do pay taxes
 
04:12:45.520 --> 04:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
they do pay taxes
um

04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
so they they pay taxes using what it's
 
04:12:53.429 --> 04:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
called an itin number uh which is a
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
number given by the irs
 
04:12:59.189 --> 04:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh another way that they they pay their
 
04:13:02.229 --> 04:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
taxes that they establish their own
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
companies and they actually end up
 
04:13:08.710 --> 04:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
hiring us citizens and people who have
 
04:13:11.429 --> 04:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
green cards to to work for them helping
 
04:13:14.950 --> 04:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
so moreover
 
04:13:19.030 --> 04:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
there are currently 17 states in the
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
district of columbia that have passed a
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
similar legislation
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
so i also provided the
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
last but not least these states have
 
04:13:36.070 --> 04:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
shown that there are many benefits by

maryland
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
have reports you know numerous reports
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%

terlaski have mentioned
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
we have um we have conversations with
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
many chiefs of police and that's one of
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
their concern if they stop someone uh
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
they prefer you know that that person
 
04:14:06.870 --> 04:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
has some sort of identity that they're
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%

04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
mobility and it helps the state's
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
economy north carolina
 
04:14:41.760 --> 04:14:44.149 align:start position:0%
economy north carolina
also

04:14:44.149 --> 04:14:44.159 align:start position:0%

same place as these individuals have
been

04:15:02.830 --> 04:15:02.840 align:start position:0%

04:15:45.429 --> 04:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sure your concern over white
 
04:15:47.910 --> 04:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
supremacy was in no way to defend white
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
supremacy but to say that white
 
04:15:50.000 --> 04:15:51.750 align:start position:0%
supremacy but to say that white
supremacists

04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%

alien or this or that i am a
 
04:17:33.279 --> 04:17:34.790 align:start position:0%
alien or this or that i am a
person

04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i live in this country for more than
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
20 years and i see the need the urge to
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
have this driver's license for everyone
 
04:17:45.030 --> 04:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
that can pay the fee
 
04:17:47.590 --> 04:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
that is able to drive
 
04:17:49.030 --> 04:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
that can
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
pass on a test on a written test
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
in the drivers you know the practical
 
04:17:53.760 --> 04:17:54.630 align:start position:0%
in the drivers you know the practical
test

04:17:54.630 --> 04:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
test
 
04:17:57.110 --> 04:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
to have a driver's license to me it's
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
like a
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
a simple thing
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
any adult any you know you have the age
 
04:18:05.670 --> 04:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
you have all the ability you have the
 
04:18:05.680 --> 04:18:06.790 align:start position:0%
you have all the ability you have the
financial

04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
financial
 
04:18:06.800 --> 04:18:08.149 align:start position:0%
financial
capacity

04:18:08.149 --> 04:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
just take the test and drive safely to
 
04:18:13.110 --> 04:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
me as simple as that
 
04:18:13.120 --> 04:18:14.469 align:start position:0%
me as simple as that
so

04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
many other states already have
 
04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
this law passed i think it's 17 or 18
 
04:18:22.710 --> 04:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
other states i'm not
 
04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
04:18:24.399 --> 04:18:25.349 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
so

04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
i hope that new hampshire will be the
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
next one
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
that will take this um in consideration
 
04:18:32.830 --> 04:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
that will approve this
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
law and
 
04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
why i wasn't ready for this
 
04:18:42.070 --> 04:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.710 --> 04:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
i think that's what i wanna
 
04:18:47.510 --> 04:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say today that i
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
live here for a long time that i see the
 
04:18:51.910 --> 04:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
need that i think the people we have we
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
have plenty examples we many of us
 
04:18:56.710 --> 04:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
already gave some examples to you to all
 
04:18:57.750 --> 04:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
of you
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
the importance to drive safely
 
04:19:00.840 --> 04:19:02.790 align:start position:0%
the importance to drive safely
um

04:19:02.790 --> 04:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
not to be caught by the police for you
 
04:19:08.070 --> 04:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
know for the light to be broken and then
 
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
have other issues
 
04:19:11.140 --> 04:19:11.150 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:19:11.150 --> 04:19:12.389 align:start position:0%
so um
[Music]

04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
because i i am a
 
04:19:17.110 --> 04:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
um from another
 
04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
country i would say
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
we all that are from other countries
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
suffer i already say this here um some
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
micro aggression which is like a little
 
04:19:30.550 --> 04:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
mosquito bite you know oh your english
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
is not good enough oh where are you from
 
04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
oh you don't have driving license oh
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with you those kind of you
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
know everyday
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
little mosquito bite little
 
04:19:41.600 --> 04:19:43.030 align:start position:0%
little mosquito bite little
microaggression

04:19:43.030 --> 04:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
microaggression
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
so the driver's license is a big one not
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
just for adults but for children
 
04:19:51.750 --> 04:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
for many many people and i would like
 
04:19:51.760 --> 04:19:52.550 align:start position:0%
for many many people and i would like
that

04:19:52.550 --> 04:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:55.269 --> 04:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
we would call like
 
04:19:57.030 --> 04:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
people people not
 
04:19:59.590 --> 04:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
alien or immigrants or this or that
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're all human beings we're all people
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that would be
 
04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
something nice to consider too and i'm
 
04:20:08.149 --> 04:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
here just to say that i'm on favor that
 
04:20:09.910 --> 04:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
i think this should be done a long time
 
04:20:12.309 --> 04:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
ago we have so many other issues that
 
04:20:15.429 --> 04:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken consideration as well
 
04:20:18.550 --> 04:20:18.560 align:start position:0%

04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
you for your work with gateway services
 
04:20:56.630 --> 04:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
i represent nashua and i know how very
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
important the agency is to our uh
 
04:20:59.040 --> 04:21:00.309 align:start position:0%
important the agency is to our uh
neighborhoods

04:21:00.309 --> 04:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
but nashua has some public
 
04:21:05.110 --> 04:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
transportation as manchester does
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
but i know that the majority of the
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
state does not can you speak to
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
any of the rural areas and what you know
 
04:21:12.720 --> 04:21:13.510 align:start position:0%
any of the rural areas and what you know
about

04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:21:15.030 --> 04:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
members of the community that may
 
04:21:17.990 --> 04:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
struggle because they are just outside
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
an area that has public transportation
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
and how uh this could be potentially
 
04:21:25.349 --> 04:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
life-changing for them in terms of um
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
providing for their families yes that's
 
04:21:29.429 --> 04:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point very good
 
04:21:29.439 --> 04:21:30.389 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point very good
question

04:21:30.389 --> 04:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
um as a counselor we try to help we try
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh there there are many problems
 
04:21:39.110 --> 04:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
transportation problems we try to solve
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
we try to find uh you know especially
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
with the school with driving the kids to
 
04:21:43.439 --> 04:21:44.469 align:start position:0%
with the school with driving the kids to
school

04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
and with the snow with the weather if
 
04:21:50.389 --> 04:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
the kid lives like a mile and a little
 
04:21:52.870 --> 04:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
step away from the school the kids
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't get the bus
 
04:21:55.590 --> 04:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
so then
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
the the older sibling has to go to
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
school to the little kid to the
 
04:22:01.510 --> 04:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
elementary level
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
walk to school
 
04:22:05.510 --> 04:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
drop off the little kid and then what
 
04:22:07.349 --> 04:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
you know walk all the way across the
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
other away
 
04:22:11.830 --> 04:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
to drop off the you know to go himself
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
to school
 
04:22:16.229 --> 04:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
so it's many many examples many barriers
 
04:22:18.870 --> 04:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
um the parents cannot drive some of the
 
04:22:21.110 --> 04:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
parents don't refuse to drive some of
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
them have to drive without the license
 
04:22:24.630 --> 04:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
because there's you know in case an
 
04:22:24.640 --> 04:22:26.790 align:start position:0%
because there's you know in case an
emergency

04:22:26.790 --> 04:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:22:28.950 --> 04:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
try to talk to another parents we try to
 
04:22:31.269 --> 04:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
solve the problem in many ways
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
we tried to get a van with the pto and
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
and community members
 
04:22:37.990 --> 04:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
so the parent that has the driver's
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
license could drive and pick up the kids
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
we try many many
 
04:22:42.000 --> 04:22:42.870 align:start position:0%
we try many many
um

04:22:42.870 --> 04:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know ideas but the the solution is
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
to get the driver's license to be able
 
04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
to drive safely and to be able to solve
 
04:22:52.790 --> 04:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
many problems not just for the kids but
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
you know for older people and so forth
 
04:22:55.199 --> 04:22:56.630 align:start position:0%
you know for older people and so forth
so

04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:58.630 --> 04:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that yeah especially the
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
kids the individuals that i serve as
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
well that have the developmental
 
04:23:02.800 --> 04:23:03.990 align:start position:0%
well that have the developmental
disability

04:23:03.990 --> 04:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
disability
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's not you know the transportation
 
04:23:08.630 --> 04:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
that we have doesn't serve them well
 
04:23:11.189 --> 04:23:11.199 align:start position:0%

manchester resident and an immigrant

rights advocate and i've been here in
 
04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
this country for over 40 years
 
04:30:46.229 --> 04:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire since 1982
 
04:30:48.790 --> 04:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
part of my work
 
04:30:50.870 --> 04:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
is work with
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
all kinds of immigrants and try to build
 
04:30:56.550 --> 04:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
relationships between police and in the
 
04:30:59.110 --> 04:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
immigrant communities
 
04:31:00.469 --> 04:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:31:00.479 --> 04:31:01.750 align:start position:0%
this bill
really

04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:31:01.760 --> 04:31:02.710 align:start position:0%
really
would

04:31:02.710 --> 04:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:31:02.720 --> 04:31:03.590 align:start position:0%
would
make

04:31:03.590 --> 04:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:31:07.110 --> 04:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
humongous progress
 
04:31:09.030 --> 04:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
building trust between these two
 
04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
different fractions of our society given
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
the lousy transportation system public
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
transportation system that we have in
 
04:31:19.750 --> 04:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire if we you know and i live
 
04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
in manchester which is a big city and
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
there's basically nothing there if you
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
do not have a car you have no way to
 
04:31:28.870 --> 04:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
bring your children to school you have
 
04:31:34.469 --> 04:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:37.110 --> 04:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
so people need a driver's license and
 
04:31:40.469 --> 04:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
this is just a reality
 
04:31:41.910 --> 04:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
people are
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
driving right now because they do not
 
04:31:44.159 --> 04:31:44.950 align:start position:0%
driving right now because they do not
have

04:31:44.950 --> 04:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
the right to get a driver's license
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
under our current laws
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
and this poses a safety threat
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
not only for our communities the
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
immigrant communities but also the
 
04:31:59.110 --> 04:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
community at large for police they stop
 
04:32:00.790 --> 04:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
somebody they really have no way of
 
04:32:03.590 --> 04:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
knowing who's behind the wheel people
 
04:32:06.149 --> 04:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
cannot find a way to register their car
 
04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
so they usually have their cars
 
04:32:10.710 --> 04:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
registered under somebody else's name
 
04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
people cannot get
 
04:32:15.269 --> 04:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
insurance car insurance for the same
 
04:32:15.279 --> 04:32:16.790 align:start position:0%
insurance car insurance for the same
reasons

04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
so given a driver's license would
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
assure that
 
04:32:23.349 --> 04:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know who you're dealing with
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
it would make sure that people know the
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
rules of the road people are
 
04:32:29.670 --> 04:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
likely to stay
 
04:32:31.990 --> 04:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the cars if there's an accident
 
04:32:35.189 --> 04:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
they're not going to flee
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
you have to pass all kinds of tests and
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
everything to to to be eligible to drive
 
04:32:43.750 --> 04:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
so i really don't
 
04:32:45.510 --> 04:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't see any
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
um bad thing about passing
 
04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
this law because people the reality is
 
04:32:54.550 --> 04:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
that people are driving as far as voting
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
and i heard many concerns about voting
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
we have people here that are legal
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
permanent residents
 
04:33:03.269 --> 04:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
for 30 40 years they have no right to
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
vote yet
 
04:33:07.349 --> 04:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
they have driver's licenses
 
04:33:10.629 --> 04:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
we know better i was here for maybe 20
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
25 years as a legal permanent resident
 
04:33:13.359 --> 04:33:14.470 align:start position:0%
25 years as a legal permanent resident
before

04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:33:16.949 --> 04:33:16.959 align:start position:0%
i was able to vote
 
04:33:20.310 --> 04:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
because i had not gone to get my tests
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
for citizenship i work in every single
 
04:33:26.390 --> 04:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
election and i never ever voted but i
 
04:33:27.990 --> 04:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
motivated those that didn't have the
 
04:33:30.390 --> 04:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
right to vote so we know better and and
 
04:33:32.949 --> 04:33:32.959 align:start position:0%
there's already all kinds of check
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
lists in place to make sure that those
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
that are not citizen do not vote so i
 
04:33:40.869 --> 04:33:40.879 align:start position:0%
just urge you to
 
04:33:40.879 --> 04:33:41.590 align:start position:0%
just urge you to
do

04:33:41.590 --> 04:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
something that's common sense and just
 
04:33:46.869 --> 04:33:46.879 align:start position:0%
vote for this that is going to help new
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire and and make us all a safer
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
community thank you
 
04:33:52.949 --> 04:33:52.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:11.670 --> 04:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
you said two minutes
 
04:34:14.789 --> 04:34:14.799 align:start position:0%
yeah good
 
04:34:17.670 --> 04:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:24.949 --> 04:34:24.959 align:start position:0%
so i came here as a refugee with my
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
and within the first few years of being
 
04:34:32.719 --> 04:34:33.510 align:start position:0%
and within the first few years of being
here

04:34:33.510 --> 04:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:34:37.269 --> 04:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
she was able to get a driver's license
 
04:34:40.390 --> 04:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
but she barely knew any english
 
04:34:42.470 --> 04:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
so she
 
04:34:44.150 --> 04:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
studied very hard
 
04:34:44.160 --> 04:34:46.150 align:start position:0%
studied very hard
and

04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:48.310 --> 04:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
got help from a translator
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
literally learned how to drive through a
 
04:34:51.359 --> 04:34:53.269 align:start position:0%
literally learned how to drive through a
translator

04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
translator
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:57.840 --> 04:34:58.869 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:34:58.869 --> 04:34:58.879 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:01.510 --> 04:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
the closest job she could get was like
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
30 to 40 minutes away from home she
 
04:35:06.949 --> 04:35:06.959 align:start position:0%
couldn't find any job
 
04:35:09.429 --> 04:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
closer than that before she got her
 
04:35:09.439 --> 04:35:10.869 align:start position:0%
closer than that before she got her
license

04:35:10.869 --> 04:35:10.879 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:35:10.879 --> 04:35:12.789 align:start position:0%
license
so

04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
getting a license really helped and
 
04:35:17.109 --> 04:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
if she
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to get one she would
 
04:35:21.910 --> 04:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
probably drive illegally
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
because she's a single mother trying to
 
04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
support five kids
 
04:35:26.799 --> 04:35:28.629 align:start position:0%
support five kids
so

04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:31.349 --> 04:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm here to tell you that you
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
should support this bill because
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
it will benefit
 
04:35:38.390 --> 04:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
many families who are probably
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
in similar situations or worse
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:35:44.390 --> 04:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.869 --> 04:35:54.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
britney shoot
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:05.830 --> 04:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
britney shoot the department does not
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
have any testimony at this time
 
04:36:09.269 --> 04:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:10.390 --> 04:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you

04:36:34.150 --> 04:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman
 
04:36:35.510 --> 04:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
and good afternoon to members of the
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record i'm neil kirk i
 
04:36:39.269 --> 04:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
live in ware
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm representing myself
 
04:36:44.789 --> 04:36:44.799 align:start position:0%
i think we all know how important
 
04:36:47.670 --> 04:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
immigrants are to the united states this
 
04:36:47.680 --> 04:36:49.109 align:start position:0%
immigrants are to the united states this
country

04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
country
 
04:36:50.789 --> 04:36:50.799 align:start position:0%
has had immigrants who have done
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
extraordinary things and become citizens
 
04:36:55.830 --> 04:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
and their families of course
 
04:36:58.629 --> 04:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
were naturalized became citizens and are
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
americans i'm one of those my parents
 
04:37:06.629 --> 04:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
that said
 
04:37:11.269 --> 04:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
as you know over the past 10 15 years
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
we've had a flood of
 
04:37:15.750 --> 04:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
undocumented or illegal immigrants into
 
04:37:17.429 --> 04:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
the country in other words those people
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
who came here
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
but without the authorization of
 
04:37:24.310 --> 04:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
congress for them to be here
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
and we just you the committee was just
 
04:37:27.910 --> 04:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
told that there are 15 000 of these
 
04:37:31.750 --> 04:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
so the question is for for this
 
04:37:34.080 --> 04:37:35.189 align:start position:0%
so the question is for for this
committee

04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:37:37.429 --> 04:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
how do we deal with a very difficult
 
04:37:37.439 --> 04:37:43.109 align:start position:0%
how do we deal with a very difficult
situation

04:37:43.109 --> 04:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
that you have before you 1666 is one
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%
that i oppose
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
and i oppose it for three reasons
 
04:37:54.240 --> 04:37:55.429 align:start position:0%
and i oppose it for three reasons
um

04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:55.439 --> 04:37:57.029 align:start position:0%
um
first

04:37:57.029 --> 04:37:57.039 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
the effect of this bill
 
04:38:02.070 --> 04:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
sections one two and five
 
04:38:04.949 --> 04:38:04.959 align:start position:0%
is to make new hampshire an
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
immigration sanctuary state
 
04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does
 
04:38:12.150 --> 04:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
it does it in two ways
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
first as you've heard
 
04:38:15.429 --> 04:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
it allows
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
undocumented or illegal immigrants to
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
get driver's licenses something they
 
04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
cannot currently do
 
04:38:25.830 --> 04:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
and secondly it either denies or makes
 
04:38:28.070 --> 04:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
it extremely difficult for federal
 
04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
authorities to have access to new
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
hampshire drivers records in immigration
 
04:38:35.189 --> 04:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
cases indeed it criminalizes their
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
behavior if they access this for those
 
04:38:37.600 --> 04:38:39.189 align:start position:0%
behavior if they access this for those
purposes

04:38:39.189 --> 04:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
a violation being a class b
 
04:38:42.240 --> 04:38:43.990 align:start position:0%
a violation being a class b
misdemeanor

04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
04:38:46.869 --> 04:38:46.879 align:start position:0%
so for those two reasons
 
04:38:49.830 --> 04:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
we see that there is a
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
an effort on the part of this bill to
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
create as i say a sanctuary state for
 
04:38:57.750 --> 04:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
illegal undocumented immigrants in new
 
04:38:57.760 --> 04:38:59.590 align:start position:0%
illegal undocumented immigrants in new
hampshire

04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
second reason i oppose the bill
 
04:39:03.750 --> 04:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:39:07.269 --> 04:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
the bill changes current law
 
04:39:09.990 --> 04:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
to make a driver's license a legal
 
04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
identity document current law says a
 
04:39:15.269 --> 04:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
driver's license is only permission to
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
operate on the roads of the motor
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle on the roads but this document
 
04:39:23.429 --> 04:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
changes that and adds
 
04:39:25.830 --> 04:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
a driver's license is a legal
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
identification documents
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
i don't understand the significance of
 
04:39:30.240 --> 04:39:32.230 align:start position:0%
i don't understand the significance of
that

04:39:32.230 --> 04:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i hope the committee will get the ag
 
04:39:36.150 --> 04:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
to come in and explain that
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:39:39.830 --> 04:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
this may make it easier for immigrants
 
04:39:42.628 --> 04:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
to prove who they are in a legal way
 
04:39:45.670 --> 04:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
but it also may promote a papers please
 
04:39:45.680 --> 04:39:47.430 align:start position:0%
but it also may promote a papers please
society

04:39:47.430 --> 04:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
society
 
04:39:48.550 --> 04:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
when the
 
04:39:50.628 --> 04:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
police or law enforcement ask people for
 
04:39:52.470 --> 04:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
documentation and require them to
 
04:39:54.788 --> 04:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
produce a driver's license which now is
 
04:39:57.590 --> 04:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
an identity document under this bill
 
04:39:59.030 --> 04:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's a good thing or a
 
04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
bad thing but i am very concerned about
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
it and it's not clear from the bill what
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
the consequences are
 
04:40:08.070 --> 04:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
the third reason has to do with social
 
04:40:11.670 --> 04:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:14.070 --> 04:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
the languages is somewhat
 
04:40:16.550 --> 04:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
unclear but basically
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
the bill coerces an applicant for a
 
04:40:18.958 --> 04:40:21.430 align:start position:0%
the bill coerces an applicant for a
non-real

04:40:21.430 --> 04:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
non-real
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
id license into providing their social
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
security numbers
 
04:40:30.070 --> 04:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
or pay an extra 100 dollars
 
04:40:32.070 --> 04:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars for the license a hundred
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
dollars for the
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
ability to remove your social security
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
number uh from the department's database
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply to a real id license
 
04:40:44.708 --> 04:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
under federal law you have to provide
 
04:40:46.390 --> 04:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
your social security number for that and
 
04:40:49.510 --> 04:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
the state dmv has to keep that number
 
04:40:52.628 --> 04:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:54.390 --> 04:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
a person who is applying for the license
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
for the first time has to provide a
 
04:40:59.670 --> 04:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
social security number but at his option
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
may have it removed from the
 
04:41:02.230 --> 04:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
department's records the department
 
04:41:04.390 --> 04:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
needs that to validate a variety of
 
04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
things but they don't need to keep it on
 
04:41:08.470 --> 04:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
record and under current law a person
 
04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to
 
04:41:12.708 --> 04:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
give permission to do it under this bill
 
04:41:14.628 --> 04:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
if you want to exercise that right it
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
cost you a hundred dollars
 
04:41:20.070 --> 04:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
the bill seems to be drafted so that it
 
04:41:22.868 --> 04:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
only applies to first time
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
license applicants and not
 
04:41:27.030 --> 04:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
to renewal applicants
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's not clear it's confusing
 
04:41:29.680 --> 04:41:30.470 align:start position:0%
it's not clear it's confusing
and

04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:31.990 --> 04:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed although
 
04:41:33.990 --> 04:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
frankly i think the idea of charging so
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
much money uh to keep your information
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
dmv database is
 
04:41:40.400 --> 04:41:42.868 align:start position:0%
dmv database is
inappropriate

04:41:42.868 --> 04:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
04:41:42.878 --> 04:41:44.868 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
specifically

04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:41:48.390 --> 04:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
section 7 which provides for the 100
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
may be viewed not as a fee but as a tax
 
04:41:54.150 --> 04:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
and is therefore unconstitutional
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire a fee can only be equal
 
04:41:58.390 --> 04:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
to the cost of providing the service
 
04:42:01.030 --> 04:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
plus 25 percent that's new hampshire
 
04:42:03.990 --> 04:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
supreme court's definition
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
the committee needs to check with dmv to
 
04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
find out whether that hundred dollars
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
meets that criteria i don't believe it
 
04:42:10.320 --> 04:42:12.868 align:start position:0%
meets that criteria i don't believe it
does

04:42:12.868 --> 04:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:12.878 --> 04:42:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
secondly

04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
04:42:17.270 --> 04:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
requiring a person to provide a social
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
security number to get a non-real id
 
04:42:20.400 --> 04:42:21.590 align:start position:0%
security number to get a non-real id
license

04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
absent to substantial justification
 
04:42:28.390 --> 04:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
is contrary to and probably in violation
 
04:42:30.070 --> 04:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the reasonably enact the recently
 
04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
enacted constitutional amendment
 
04:42:34.150 --> 04:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
article 2b
 
04:42:34.160 --> 04:42:35.110 align:start position:0%
article 2b
says

04:42:35.110 --> 04:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:42:37.350 --> 04:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
this is called a right to privacy an
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
individual's right to live free from
 
04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion in private or
 
04:42:43.750 --> 04:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
04:42:46.868 --> 04:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent
 
04:42:46.878 --> 04:42:48.470 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent
now

04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:42:50.948 --> 04:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
the bill seems to say one can buy his
 
04:42:50.958 --> 04:42:51.750 align:start position:0%
the bill seems to say one can buy his
way

04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:42:53.990 --> 04:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
his or her way out of information
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
sharing with the government
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
by paying for it
 
04:42:59.830 --> 04:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
this suggests to me at least that
 
04:43:02.550 --> 04:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
there's no compelling reason
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
for the government to have that social
 
04:43:06.150 --> 04:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
security number
 
04:43:08.470 --> 04:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case
 
04:43:11.190 --> 04:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's a violation of
 
04:43:15.510 --> 04:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:17.590 --> 04:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
for these three reasons i would ask the
 
04:43:19.510 --> 04:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
committee find the bill inexpedient to
 
04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you mr chairman
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the committee
 
04:43:28.150 --> 04:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative talersky
 
04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for taking my
 
04:43:35.040 --> 04:43:36.150 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for taking my
question

04:43:36.150 --> 04:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:43:36.160 --> 04:43:38.788 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
your history here uh in transportation
 
04:43:44.070 --> 04:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
has come up quite a bit in my uh one and
 
04:43:45.590 --> 04:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
a half terms and it's nice to finally
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
meet you
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
um i understand that you've always been
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
a proponent of
 
04:43:53.670 --> 04:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
the right to privacy
 
04:43:55.350 --> 04:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
for people who live here in new
 
04:43:55.360 --> 04:43:56.470 align:start position:0%
for people who live here in new
hampshire

04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:43:57.750 --> 04:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
04:44:01.510 --> 04:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
and um i am curious though as you said
 
04:44:03.750 --> 04:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
that part of the parts of this bill that
 
04:44:05.350 --> 04:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
you disagree with
 
04:44:07.190 --> 04:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
04:44:10.230 --> 04:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
the records were to be kept from federal
 
04:44:13.030 --> 04:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
authorities and i'm wondering why
 
04:44:16.948 --> 04:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
that view of people's right to privacy
 
04:44:19.270 --> 04:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
would not apply to this group of
 
04:44:21.430 --> 04:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
individuals that would benefit from this
 
04:44:21.440 --> 04:44:24.550 align:start position:0%
individuals that would benefit from this
bill

04:44:24.550 --> 04:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:26.868 --> 04:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
the federal government has established a
 
04:44:29.590 --> 04:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
policy with respect to immigration
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
the federal government has authorized
 
04:44:35.110 --> 04:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:36.788 --> 04:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
that establishes
 
04:44:36.798 --> 04:44:38.390 align:start position:0%
that establishes
a

04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
justification we can debate whether it's
 
04:44:42.628 --> 04:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
compelling or not for the federal
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
government have access for this
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
information for new hampshire to stand
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
in the way of the federal government
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
getting this information to enforce its
 
04:44:50.320 --> 04:44:51.270 align:start position:0%
getting this information to enforce its
laws

04:44:51.270 --> 04:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
laws
 
04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be contrary to the nature
 
04:44:57.750 --> 04:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:01.510 --> 04:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
were there no federal immigration laws
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
i certainly would agree with you that
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
this information should not be made
 
04:45:07.270 --> 04:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
available to federal authorities
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
but considering that there are i think
 
04:45:11.350 --> 04:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate for us to deny the
 
04:45:12.948 --> 04:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
federal government the information it
 
04:45:15.510 --> 04:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
needs to enforce its laws and remember
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
04:45:19.990 --> 04:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
is under the constitution of the united
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
states the supreme law of the land
 
04:45:29.430 --> 04:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it thank you very much
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question by the way
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:40.470 --> 04:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
04:45:42.310 --> 04:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
i'll just clarify
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
point one which you said
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
sections one two and five would make new
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire an immigration sanctuary state
 
04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
so but why is that a bad thing i mean
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm old enough to remember when
 
04:45:54.628 --> 04:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
we welcome
 
04:45:56.470 --> 04:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
millions of uh
 
04:45:58.708 --> 04:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
immigrants from uh from europe who are
 
04:46:00.708 --> 04:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
fleeing oppression either communists or
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
fascists or even just
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
fleeing the social uh
 
04:46:07.030 --> 04:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
chaos to follow world war ii so why is
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
representative horgan um
 
04:46:16.948 --> 04:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
it's not a bad thing
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
the problem is that there are different
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of immigrants to the united states
 
04:46:23.590 --> 04:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
some of them are here legally and as i
 
04:46:26.070 --> 04:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
said in my introductory statement
 
04:46:27.750 --> 04:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
i heartily support that this country
 
04:46:29.670 --> 04:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
needs immigrants for population growth
 
04:46:32.310 --> 04:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
for brains for talents goodness knows
 
04:46:32.320 --> 04:46:33.350 align:start position:0%
for brains for talents goodness knows
what

04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:46:34.948 --> 04:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
and i would hope the federal government
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
would be passing policies to encourage
 
04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
those folks to come here
 
04:46:41.430 --> 04:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
but if you have an immigration law at
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
the federal level
 
04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's got to be enforced and we may not
 
04:46:47.110 --> 04:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
like it we may want to change it in
 
04:46:49.030 --> 04:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
which case we should do that but until
 
04:46:50.708 --> 04:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
that happens
 
04:46:54.550 --> 04:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:56.788 --> 04:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
those people who are not here in
 
04:46:58.708 --> 04:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
accordance with those laws
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
do not get the benefits that those
 
04:47:02.868 --> 04:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
people who here are here immigrants who
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
are here in accordance with those laws
 
04:47:10.390 --> 04:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:13.350 --> 04:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you representative schultz
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:47:17.190 --> 04:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
it is great to see you i've admired when
 
04:47:19.910 --> 04:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
you served in this body how fiercely you
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
fought for privacy i think that you um
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
i admire you for that and it's good to
 
04:47:26.470 --> 04:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
see you again
 
04:47:28.708 --> 04:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
um i hope i'm asking this question in a
 
04:47:31.590 --> 04:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
way that is germane but
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
since you've raised the issue of
 
04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
who has documented status and who
 
04:47:38.400 --> 04:47:39.750 align:start position:0%
who has documented status and who
doesn't

04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
you must know that the need for
 
04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
immigrant workers now
 
04:47:48.390 --> 04:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
is far outpacing the number of available
 
04:47:52.470 --> 04:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
visas and while that's a federal
 
04:47:54.948 --> 04:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
issue that needs to be rectified you you
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
must know
 
04:47:57.670 --> 04:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
that there are businesses in new
 
04:47:59.590 --> 04:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire that
 
04:48:02.550 --> 04:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
really desperately need the help because
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
american citizens aren't
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
working in those jobs currently or don't
 
04:48:12.150 --> 04:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:16.708 --> 04:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:19.510 --> 04:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
in raising this you made a
 
04:48:22.070 --> 04:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
very clear point about the distinction
 
04:48:24.310 --> 04:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
between people who are currently not
 
04:48:24.320 --> 04:48:26.470 align:start position:0%
between people who are currently not
documented

04:48:26.470 --> 04:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
documented
 
04:48:29.350 --> 04:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
through work visas or tourist visas or
 
04:48:31.750 --> 04:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
as a citizen
 
04:48:33.910 --> 04:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
which obviously is an important point
 
04:48:36.070 --> 04:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
that this bill addresses
 
04:48:39.430 --> 04:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
but you must also understand
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
given your understanding of the free
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
market suspend please suspend plea
 
04:48:46.948 --> 04:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
please just ask a question
 
04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
no just ask it in a question please
 
04:48:51.030 --> 04:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just am aware he is
 
04:48:52.390 --> 04:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
a fierce
 
04:48:54.550 --> 04:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
fighter for the free market and our
 
04:48:57.030 --> 04:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
market desperately needs workers when we
 
04:48:59.910 --> 04:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
don't have enough visas
 
04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
representative schultz i do understand
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
the question and it is complicated
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is the state legislature
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
i recognize that in the free market
 
04:49:12.788 --> 04:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
things happen
 
04:49:15.270 --> 04:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
illegals are hired there's a great need
 
04:49:18.550 --> 04:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
for all sorts of not just
 
04:49:19.830 --> 04:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
farm workers
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
but all sorts of workers we have what
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
2.6 unemployment rate
 
04:49:24.798 --> 04:49:26.310 align:start position:0%
2.6 unemployment rate
businesses

04:49:26.310 --> 04:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
they don't advertise hamburgers anymore
 
04:49:29.910 --> 04:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
they advertise help wanted
 
04:49:32.948 --> 04:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
we understand that the question for the
 
04:49:36.550 --> 04:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
legislature is
 
04:49:39.990 --> 04:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
do we act to facilitate
 
04:49:42.868 --> 04:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
illegal undocumented
 
04:49:42.878 --> 04:49:45.030 align:start position:0%
illegal undocumented
immigrants

04:49:45.030 --> 04:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
to work in this state
 
04:49:49.350 --> 04:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
contrary to federal law and i think
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
while a business may or may not want to
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
skirt the law i don't think it's
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the legislature to do
 
04:49:55.600 --> 04:49:56.390 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the legislature to do
that

04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:58.230 --> 04:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
to facilitate that
 
04:50:00.550 --> 04:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
but i i do appreciate your
 
04:50:02.948 --> 04:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
your concerns and i share them and as i
 
04:50:04.310 --> 04:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
said at the beginning i think this
 
04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
country needs to adopt a much more
 
04:50:06.240 --> 04:50:07.910 align:start position:0%
country needs to adopt a much more
comprehensive

04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
04:50:10.390 --> 04:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
immigration policy so that
 
04:50:12.788 --> 04:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
both temporary and permanent workers can
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
come from abroad i mean in our
 
04:50:17.030 --> 04:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
competition with russia and china and
 
04:50:18.708 --> 04:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
all of the other countries brain power
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
is crucial we have an opportunity this
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
is a magnet country for all sorts of
 
04:50:25.510 --> 04:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
people and why we're not taking
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
advantage of it
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
you ought to run for congress let's put
 
04:50:32.310 --> 04:50:32.320 align:start position:0%

05:00:06.868 --> 05:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
isn't easily fixable sometimes and
 
05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's pretty easy in this
 
05:00:10.390 --> 05:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
i spent some time with the former
 
05:00:14.390 --> 05:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
director of the dmv and this was the
 
05:00:16.550 --> 05:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
language that we came up with but
 
05:00:19.750 --> 05:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um the bill
 
05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
never made it through the covid process
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
so it was not there was never a vote on
 
05:00:25.510 --> 05:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
this bill in the past but this is the
 
05:00:28.230 --> 05:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
same bill that i've introduced before
 
05:00:30.868 --> 05:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
its purpose is pretty straightforward
 
05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
and also quite limited
 
05:00:33.520 --> 05:00:34.868 align:start position:0%
and also quite limited
um

05:00:34.868 --> 05:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background for those of
 
05:00:38.788 --> 05:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
you who are struggling to keep up with
 
05:00:39.750 --> 05:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
all these
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
twists and turns about immigration law
 
05:00:46.470 --> 05:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
a person can come into this country
 
05:00:46.480 --> 05:00:47.670 align:start position:0%
a person can come into this country
legally

05:00:47.670 --> 05:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
legally
 
05:00:51.270 --> 05:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
as an example on a tourist permit
 
05:00:54.150 --> 05:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
but they came here on that on this
 
05:00:57.270 --> 05:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
tourist permit a tourist visa
 
05:00:59.110 --> 05:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
because of
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
violence in their country for instance
 
05:01:03.110 --> 05:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
and that they could escape they came
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
here they were here in the united states
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
legally their next step
 
05:01:10.948 --> 05:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
is to apply for asylum to get achieve
 
05:01:15.430 --> 05:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
whilst waiting for that they have no way
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
to drive because they are a temporary
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
resident and you can't get a driver's
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
license if you're a temporary resident
 
05:01:26.470 --> 05:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
05:01:26.480 --> 05:01:28.788 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
there's

05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
so what happens is when they put in
 
05:01:33.110 --> 05:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
their asylum request
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
they're still ineligible to apply to get
 
05:01:38.310 --> 05:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
a driver's license
 
05:01:38.320 --> 05:01:39.910 align:start position:0%
a driver's license
however

05:01:39.910 --> 05:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:01:41.590 --> 05:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
one of the federal rules under the
 
05:01:43.110 --> 05:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
immigration laws
 
05:01:44.550 --> 05:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
if you do not receive your hearing
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
after one year
 
05:01:52.788 --> 05:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
then you can get a work permit
 
05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
that status then allows you to apply for
 
05:01:57.350 --> 05:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
a driver's license here in new hampshire
 
05:01:59.590 --> 05:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
if you have a work permit
 
05:02:02.070 --> 05:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
the disconnect that this bill is
 
05:02:03.910 --> 05:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
attempting to fix
 
05:02:05.270 --> 05:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
they arrive
 
05:02:07.360 --> 05:02:08.310 align:start position:0%
they arrive
they

05:02:08.310 --> 05:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:02:11.350 --> 05:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
file their asylum status request
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
and then they have to wait for a whole
 
05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
year before they can
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
actually apply for a driver's license in
 
05:02:19.350 --> 05:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
rural northern new hampshire
 
05:02:20.470 --> 05:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
05:02:22.788 --> 05:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
that's a problem
 
05:02:25.190 --> 05:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's really really difficult so
 
05:02:27.270 --> 05:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
the language was worked out with dmv
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
last year um it's just attempting to
 
05:02:33.670 --> 05:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
give them a temporary driver's license
 
05:02:36.390 --> 05:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
while they wait for adjudication on
 
05:02:38.230 --> 05:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
their permanent status
 
05:02:40.550 --> 05:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me while they wait to receive
 
05:02:40.560 --> 05:02:41.830 align:start position:0%
excuse me while they wait to receive
their

05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:02:43.990 --> 05:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
work permit which they can then go in
 
05:02:46.390 --> 05:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
and take the driver's test both written
 
05:02:49.110 --> 05:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
and practical and they can drive legally
 
05:02:50.788 --> 05:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire this they're here
 
05:02:50.798 --> 05:02:51.830 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire this they're here
legally

05:02:51.830 --> 05:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
legally
 
05:02:53.910 --> 05:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's a legal process for them to get
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
their driver's license but they have to
 
05:02:57.910 --> 05:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
wait one year
 
05:03:00.230 --> 05:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
the problem also applies to the fact
 
05:03:00.240 --> 05:03:01.190 align:start position:0%
the problem also applies to the fact
that

05:03:01.190 --> 05:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:06.390 --> 05:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
information about
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
asylum requests i can speak from
 
05:03:11.270 --> 05:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
personal knowledge that a person that i
 
05:03:13.830 --> 05:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
um helped sponsor through
 
05:03:17.670 --> 05:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
um escaping his country due to violence
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
who now lives in lebanon works in
 
05:03:22.868 --> 05:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
lebanon and now drives in lebanon he is
 
05:03:25.990 --> 05:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
at year seven waiting for his
 
05:03:28.948 --> 05:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
asylum requests to be heard
 
05:03:30.948 --> 05:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
so that's why we try to
 
05:03:33.670 --> 05:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
make their entryway to getting driving
 
05:03:36.550 --> 05:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
privileges a little faster within a
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
system that dmv
 
05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
has in the past been supportive of
 
05:03:43.990 --> 05:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
and if i'm certainly happy to take any
 
05:03:44.000 --> 05:03:46.628 align:start position:0%
and if i'm certainly happy to take any
questions

05:03:46.628 --> 05:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:03:49.590 --> 05:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
05:03:51.590 --> 05:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
05:03:59.510 --> 05:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
is this legislation of yours
 
05:04:03.030 --> 05:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
any legislation from
 
05:04:07.110 --> 05:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
from another country perhaps if if one
 
05:04:09.110 --> 05:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
of those asylum seekers had chosen a
 
05:04:11.590 --> 05:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
country other than the united states
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
would they have that ability
 
05:04:16.708 --> 05:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
to get a temporary driver's license and
 
05:04:19.350 --> 05:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh and operate in in that country as
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
well well i'm not sure that i'm
 
05:04:22.948 --> 05:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
qualified to know
 
05:04:25.030 --> 05:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh a full and complete answer for that
 
05:04:27.510 --> 05:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative hill what i can tell you
 
05:04:30.150 --> 05:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
is that the bill that's before you
 
05:04:32.708 --> 05:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
was a specific for
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:04:36.550 --> 05:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
just trying to fix the problem for
 
05:04:38.550 --> 05:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
asylum seekers who
 
05:04:40.788 --> 05:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
choose for whatever reason to come and
 
05:04:44.948 --> 05:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:48.150 --> 05:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you but i'm i'm wondering if if um
 
05:04:50.550 --> 05:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
when you submitted the
 
05:04:52.470 --> 05:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
the bill to
 
05:04:55.750 --> 05:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
ols whether that was
 
05:04:58.470 --> 05:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
as a result of or
 
05:05:01.350 --> 05:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
included in language that came from some
 
05:05:04.708 --> 05:05:04.718 align:start position:0%
other place that was that this type of
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
operation had been
 
05:05:08.230 --> 05:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
had been approved
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
is this possible in another country i
 
05:05:10.080 --> 05:05:10.868 align:start position:0%
is this possible in another country i
guess

05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
guess
 
05:05:12.390 --> 05:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't i don't have an answer to
 
05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
that it was i i did not consult with any
 
05:05:18.550 --> 05:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions again this was i was
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
looking for a new hampshire specific
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
fix to a problem
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
although it's very narrow in scope that
 
05:05:28.390 --> 05:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's not like we have thousands of
 
05:05:31.110 --> 05:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
asylum seekers but we do have some
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
and they have difficulty getting their
 
05:05:34.948 --> 05:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
driver's license in a timely manner so
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
this was a temporary solution for them
 
05:05:40.310 --> 05:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
until they can then apply for a
 
05:05:41.910 --> 05:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
permanent driver's license after
 
05:05:43.750 --> 05:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
receiving their work permit
 
05:05:45.990 --> 05:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative talersky
 
05:05:51.270 --> 05:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:05:53.270 --> 05:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative sykes
 
05:05:53.280 --> 05:05:54.310 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative sykes
um

05:05:54.310 --> 05:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:56.628 --> 05:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
following your timeline of someone
 
05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
applies they get a hearing within a year
 
05:06:00.948 --> 05:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
they can then uh apply for driver's
 
05:06:03.510 --> 05:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
license the 180 days
 
05:06:03.520 --> 05:06:04.550 align:start position:0%
license the 180 days
um

05:06:04.550 --> 05:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:06.628 --> 05:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
that the driver's license can be valid
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's six months so i guess i'm just
 
05:06:08.480 --> 05:06:09.670 align:start position:0%
that's six months so i guess i'm just
curious

05:06:09.670 --> 05:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
curious
 
05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:15.270 --> 05:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
does that 180 days
 
05:06:17.910 --> 05:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
start or how did that number come about
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
if you could help me understand that so
 
05:06:22.150 --> 05:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
format i'm going to have to name names
 
05:06:22.160 --> 05:06:23.590 align:start position:0%
format i'm going to have to name names
here

05:06:23.590 --> 05:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
former director
 
05:06:25.040 --> 05:06:26.708 align:start position:0%
former director
bilecki

05:06:26.708 --> 05:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
bilecki
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i came to the realization that
 
05:06:32.708 --> 05:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
the license need only be good for 180
 
05:06:34.550 --> 05:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
days because that's approximately the
 
05:06:36.070 --> 05:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
time it would take
 
05:06:37.990 --> 05:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
once they were eligible to get this
 
05:06:39.750 --> 05:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
temporary license
 
05:06:41.190 --> 05:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
that would be the time it would take
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
before they could get there
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
once they had it would take for them to
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
get a work permit and move on
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
so there's there's like i said it's just
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's a narrow window of time that we're
 
05:06:53.990 --> 05:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
trying to fix hence the reason it's
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:07:07.590 --> 05:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
taking my additional question
 
05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
um when they submit for a temporary
 
05:07:13.590 --> 05:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
05:07:18.830 --> 05:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
number i don't i don't believe it does
 
05:07:22.400 --> 05:07:23.430 align:start position:0%
number i don't i don't believe it does
um

05:07:23.430 --> 05:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm not i i have to beg off to the
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
dmv about that i think the
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
the question would be more accurately
 
05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
representative i think
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
is can you get a social security number
 
05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
before you have a work permit
 
05:07:42.150 --> 05:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:44.628 --> 05:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
right well and do you need
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
a social security number to get the work
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
from it
 
05:07:52.390 --> 05:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
again i don't have the answer to that
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
i i just would like
 
05:07:56.948 --> 05:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate your question thank you
 
05:07:58.948 --> 05:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
i what i'm really trying to focus on
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
here is just a very narrow problem
 
05:08:05.190 --> 05:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
and that is driving privileges for for a
 
05:08:07.510 --> 05:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
very discreet group of
 
05:08:07.520 --> 05:08:08.788 align:start position:0%
very discreet group of
individuals

05:08:08.788 --> 05:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
05:08:11.670 --> 05:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
for a very discreet length of time until
 
05:08:13.350 --> 05:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
they can then fulfill
 
05:08:16.708 --> 05:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
the requirements for a a full
 
05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that so i have a
 
05:08:26.550 --> 05:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
question you said it's a very narrow
 
05:08:28.550 --> 05:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
issue and it may be
 
05:08:30.390 --> 05:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
but this is relative can you say you
 
05:08:33.030 --> 05:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
have experience in this
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
who is eligible to seek asylum and under
 
05:08:37.830 --> 05:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
what circumstances
 
05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
in general without getting too deep in
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
the weeds because
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the reading i've done on the into the
 
05:08:44.948 --> 05:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
immigration laws and we're not debating
 
05:08:47.110 --> 05:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
those here it doesn't seem to be that
 
05:08:47.120 --> 05:08:51.990 align:start position:0%
those here it doesn't seem to be that
narrow

05:08:51.990 --> 05:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:55.030 --> 05:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer for that i would
 
05:08:57.190 --> 05:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
prefer to have an immigration
 
05:08:59.350 --> 05:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
some other immigration official answer
 
05:09:00.550 --> 05:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
that question
 
05:09:00.560 --> 05:09:01.350 align:start position:0%
that question
um

05:09:01.350 --> 05:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:03.510 --> 05:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
when i had my conversations with dmv
 
05:09:05.830 --> 05:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
there was a very small number i don't
 
05:09:07.270 --> 05:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was last year and i've
 
05:09:09.030 --> 05:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
been looking for my notes but it was a
 
05:09:10.830 --> 05:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
very small number of
 
05:09:12.550 --> 05:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you state
 
05:09:12.560 --> 05:09:13.990 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you state
representative

05:09:13.990 --> 05:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:09:15.510 --> 05:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:09:16.948 --> 05:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
representative sykes for taking my
 
05:09:16.958 --> 05:09:18.150 align:start position:0%
representative sykes for taking my
question

05:09:18.150 --> 05:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:09:20.070 --> 05:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
is the concept of this if if someone
 
05:09:22.948 --> 05:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
gets a temporary license for 180 days is
 
05:09:22.958 --> 05:09:23.750 align:start position:0%
gets a temporary license for 180 days is
this

05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:09:26.070 --> 05:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
kind of the stepping stone to getting a
 
05:09:26.080 --> 05:09:27.510 align:start position:0%
kind of the stepping stone to getting a
full-fledged

05:09:27.510 --> 05:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
full-fledged
 
05:09:29.350 --> 05:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
license i guess i'll call it
 
05:09:31.350 --> 05:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
well before the yeah the
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
one it's partly it's a public safety
 
05:09:36.070 --> 05:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
issue okay partly and i guess i would
 
05:09:40.628 --> 05:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i stand to be corrected about this
 
05:09:44.310 --> 05:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
but when you
 
05:09:45.750 --> 05:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
when you
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
choose to move into new hampshire you
 
05:09:49.510 --> 05:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
have a there's a time frame when you
 
05:09:51.350 --> 05:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
have to apply for a driver's license if
 
05:09:53.190 --> 05:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
you're driving
 
05:09:55.510 --> 05:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
now prior to that they could be using
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
their the driver's license
 
05:10:00.788 --> 05:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
from another jurisdiction
 
05:10:02.070 --> 05:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
that creates
 
05:10:04.628 --> 05:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
problems in and of itself in terms of
 
05:10:04.638 --> 05:10:05.670 align:start position:0%
problems in and of itself in terms of
making

05:10:05.670 --> 05:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
making
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
is this driver license the same thing as
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
what you know are you driving a tractor
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
trailer when you really only should be
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
driving a car
 
05:10:14.948 --> 05:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
so those kinds of questions could come
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
up we could have translation issues
 
05:10:20.830 --> 05:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
all of those things can be
 
05:10:23.510 --> 05:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
problematic however
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
you are legally allowed to drive under
 
05:10:25.280 --> 05:10:26.390 align:start position:0%
you are legally allowed to drive under
your

05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
for the sake of discussion your haitian
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
which is in french
 
05:10:33.270 --> 05:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
and may or may not be
 
05:10:35.430 --> 05:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
extreme it may not be particularly
 
05:10:35.440 --> 05:10:36.788 align:start position:0%
extreme it may not be particularly
equivalent

05:10:36.788 --> 05:10:36.798 align:start position:0%
equivalent
 
05:10:38.550 --> 05:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
under this you would
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
still have to take the driver's test
 
05:10:42.708 --> 05:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
both written and practical
 
05:10:44.390 --> 05:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
and you would get
 
05:10:46.948 --> 05:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
a temporary license identifying it as
 
05:10:50.230 --> 05:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
such that it is temporary
 
05:10:52.390 --> 05:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
until you get your work permit if for
 
05:10:54.150 --> 05:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
some the reason for the
 
05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
length of time
 
05:10:58.230 --> 05:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
if you don't go and get a work permit
 
05:11:00.550 --> 05:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
based on your asylum request
 
05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
then you that driving privilege goes
 
05:11:02.480 --> 05:11:03.350 align:start position:0%
then you that driving privilege goes
away

05:11:03.350 --> 05:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:11:05.430 --> 05:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for it being temporary
 
05:11:07.910 --> 05:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
if you do get your work permit you can
 
05:11:09.670 --> 05:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
take the next step and get a driver's
 
05:11:09.680 --> 05:11:13.990 align:start position:0%
take the next step and get a driver's
license

05:11:13.990 --> 05:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.708 --> 05:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:11:20.150 --> 05:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:22.550 --> 05:11:22.560 align:start position:0%

05:12:24.550 --> 05:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
to apply for a work permit first um
 
05:12:26.310 --> 05:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
before you get your social security
 
05:12:26.320 --> 05:12:27.350 align:start position:0%
before you get your social security
number

05:12:27.350 --> 05:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:12:29.350 --> 05:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
and in order to people who apply for
 
05:12:31.350 --> 05:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
asylum apply for asylum based on
 
05:12:33.750 --> 05:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
credible fear of persecution because
 
05:12:35.430 --> 05:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
their life would be in danger due to
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
their political or religious beliefs or
 
05:12:39.590 --> 05:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
their affiliation with a particular
 
05:12:41.910 --> 05:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
marginalized group based on nationality
 
05:12:44.708 --> 05:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
race or gender so there are particular
 
05:12:46.390 --> 05:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
categories as to why people do seek
 
05:12:46.400 --> 05:12:47.670 align:start position:0%
categories as to why people do seek
asylum

05:12:47.670 --> 05:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
asylum
 
05:12:50.070 --> 05:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
and the last data does show that um in
 
05:12:51.990 --> 05:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
the last set of from 2019 my colleagues
 
05:12:55.030 --> 05:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
did share with me we had about 27 000 um
 
05:12:56.948 --> 05:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
asylum petitions granted in new
 
05:12:56.958 --> 05:12:58.230 align:start position:0%
asylum petitions granted in new
hampshire

05:12:58.230 --> 05:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:12:58.240 --> 05:12:59.350 align:start position:0%
hampshire
so

05:12:59.350 --> 05:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:13:01.350 --> 05:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
i want to go into why this bill we are
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
seeking support for hb 1093
 
05:13:05.830 --> 05:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
we are
 
05:13:08.310 --> 05:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to please um to
 
05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
pass this bill in order to diminish the
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
waiting period for
 
05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire who are
 
05:13:15.510 --> 05:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
seeking asylum in order for them to be
 
05:13:17.350 --> 05:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
able to be issued a temporary driver's
 
05:13:17.360 --> 05:13:18.628 align:start position:0%
able to be issued a temporary driver's
license

05:13:18.628 --> 05:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:13:20.708 --> 05:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
as many of us many of folks have heard
 
05:13:22.470 --> 05:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
and continue to learn about our
 
05:13:25.110 --> 05:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
immigration system are the work permit
 
05:13:25.120 --> 05:13:25.910 align:start position:0%
immigration system are the work permit
and

05:13:25.910 --> 05:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:28.150 --> 05:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
work permit and adjudications are
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
backlogged with significant delays and
 
05:13:31.830 --> 05:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
this has significant impact on
 
05:13:31.840 --> 05:13:32.948 align:start position:0%
this has significant impact on
communities

05:13:32.948 --> 05:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:13:35.190 --> 05:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
and families of asylum seekers in new
 
05:13:35.200 --> 05:13:36.150 align:start position:0%
and families of asylum seekers in new
hampshire

05:13:36.150 --> 05:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
this means that even after waiting a
 
05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
year to apply for permission to work um
 
05:13:42.070 --> 05:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
it could still take a year another year
 
05:13:45.190 --> 05:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
or more um in in order for that work
 
05:13:47.030 --> 05:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
permit to be issued and with that work
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
authorization most asylum seekers again
 
05:13:50.550 --> 05:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
would not be able to
 
05:13:52.150 --> 05:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
be able to get their social security
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
number um be able to provide for their
 
05:13:56.230 --> 05:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
families and do what they need to do so
 
05:13:58.470 --> 05:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
as i know we continue to hear that new
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a state that is very
 
05:14:01.670 --> 05:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to live in if you're not able
 
05:14:04.868 --> 05:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
to be able to drive
 
05:14:07.350 --> 05:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
during this bill would allow
 
05:14:09.430 --> 05:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
petitioners to be able to obtain a
 
05:14:11.670 --> 05:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
driver's license and they would they
 
05:14:13.110 --> 05:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
would also
 
05:14:16.230 --> 05:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
um i apologize i lost my place
 
05:14:19.270 --> 05:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
it would add an eligible eligibility
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
class to that would allow people to be
 
05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
able to get their driver's licenses so i
 
05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
do urge the committee to please pass hb
 
05:14:29.430 --> 05:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
1093 because it does in fact serve the
 
05:14:31.110 --> 05:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire and does
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
indeed close a significant gap that has
 
05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
been described here in our state thank
 
05:14:38.310 --> 05:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
you happy to take questions
 
05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
05:14:43.830 --> 05:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative i'll be very quick i just
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify and maybe see if i was
 
05:14:51.030 --> 05:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding the speaker about a
 
05:14:52.550 --> 05:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
piece of information she included she
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
said 27 000 asylum seekers which i just
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
googled because it seems like a lot
 
05:15:02.070 --> 05:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm on the dhhs new hampshire.gov
 
05:15:04.788 --> 05:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
website the health of human services
 
05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
and it appears that it looks like
 
05:15:10.470 --> 05:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
the most recent information is from 2019
 
05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
that there were 400 total refugees
 
05:15:16.550 --> 05:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
the year before that 393 total refugees
 
05:15:19.510 --> 05:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
so is it possible that that 27 000 is a
 
05:15:22.230 --> 05:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
total since a certain year back
 
05:15:24.550 --> 05:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
oh yeah you're i'm probably right i
 
05:15:25.750 --> 05:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
would have to double check with my
 
05:15:25.760 --> 05:15:27.270 align:start position:0%
would have to double check with my
colleagues

05:15:27.270 --> 05:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
05:15:27.280 --> 05:15:28.390 align:start position:0%
colleagues
sorry

05:15:28.390 --> 05:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:15:29.990 --> 05:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
oh i apologize the number is for
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
countrywide that
 
05:15:32.160 --> 05:15:33.270 align:start position:0%
countrywide that
that

05:15:33.270 --> 05:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:15:34.550 --> 05:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
and yes refugees are a different
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
category from asylum seekers but i do
 
05:15:38.230 --> 05:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
apologize for that misunderstanding it
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
is countrywide not specific to new
 
05:15:39.920 --> 05:15:40.868 align:start position:0%
is countrywide not specific to new
hampshire

05:15:40.868 --> 05:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:15:42.150 --> 05:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for that clarification i
 
05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
apologize to the chair first thank you
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
for catching that
 
05:15:48.230 --> 05:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:15:52.708 --> 05:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:54.390 --> 05:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes jeff overdank from the
 
05:16:05.830 --> 05:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman and members
 
05:16:08.788 --> 05:16:08.798 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
is jeff overnight and i'm here to
 
05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
represent the division of motor vehicles
 
05:16:14.470 --> 05:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
and opposition in this bill today
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
in very similar fashion to the way i
 
05:16:18.628 --> 05:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
testified on an earlier bill for the
 
05:16:20.550 --> 05:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
same reasons that
 
05:16:22.230 --> 05:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
there is a process that one goes through
 
05:16:25.110 --> 05:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
when you apply for a driver license
 
05:16:26.550 --> 05:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
let's say you're moving in from another
 
05:16:27.990 --> 05:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
state you come into the counter you fill
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
out the application you provide a driver
 
05:16:32.230 --> 05:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
license to us as proof that you've got a
 
05:16:34.470 --> 05:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
license in another state
 
05:16:36.150 --> 05:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
we immediately do some data entry while
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
you're standing there and we go out to
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
that other state and says
 
05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
does this person have the ability to
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
drive and is a license in good standing
 
05:16:45.590 --> 05:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
and that answer comes back immediately
 
05:16:47.110 --> 05:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
and that gives us the authority the
 
05:16:48.310 --> 05:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
ability to go out and make sure that
 
05:16:50.470 --> 05:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
you're qualified to drive
 
05:16:52.150 --> 05:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
secondly if you were to provide your
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
social security card to us as you are to
 
05:16:55.830 --> 05:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
answer the earlier question from the
 
05:16:57.670 --> 05:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative it is a requirement to
 
05:16:59.190 --> 05:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
provide your social security number on
 
05:17:00.230 --> 05:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
your first
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
driver license application that is found
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
in section 263 of the motor vehicle code
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
we then run that social security number
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
through our system we go right out to
 
05:17:10.550 --> 05:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
social security and it comes back and
 
05:17:12.310 --> 05:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
tells us whether or not that's your card
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
and if it's a valid number
 
05:17:16.470 --> 05:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
and in the same fashion and has provided
 
05:17:18.310 --> 05:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
an earlier testimony on an earlier bill
 
05:17:19.750 --> 05:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
we have the same
 
05:17:21.830 --> 05:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
instant link up with
 
05:17:24.550 --> 05:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
department of homeland security specific
 
05:17:27.190 --> 05:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
uscis customs immigration
 
05:17:29.750 --> 05:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
and when you provide us documentation
 
05:17:32.070 --> 05:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
from immigration we immediately go out
 
05:17:33.830 --> 05:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
with that information that you provided
 
05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
us on the application and any documents
 
05:17:38.070 --> 05:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
you may have handed to us
 
05:17:39.510 --> 05:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
and we send an immediate answer
 
05:17:43.110 --> 05:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
immediate require a query out to uscis
 
05:17:45.110 --> 05:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
and we say is this a valid card this is
 
05:17:47.350 --> 05:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
a valid status
 
05:17:49.830 --> 05:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
and based on our interpretation of 263
 
05:17:52.708 --> 05:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
39a as it's written is that that status
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
is to be verified before you issue a
 
05:17:56.948 --> 05:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
driver license or non-driver
 
05:17:59.270 --> 05:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
identification card
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
and in the event you've just applied or
 
05:18:03.990 --> 05:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
just provided an application to
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%

until they're determined to be approved
 
05:18:16.230 --> 05:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
so what you're asking for us to do is
 
05:18:18.310 --> 05:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
verify some documents in this bill and
 
05:18:21.750 --> 05:18:21.760 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you for taking my
question

05:18:33.270 --> 05:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:18:36.230 --> 05:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
are you aware of
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
anything that an asylum seeker would
 
05:18:38.400 --> 05:18:39.270 align:start position:0%
anything that an asylum seeker would
have

05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:18:41.590 --> 05:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
that would demonstrate that they had
 
05:18:43.590 --> 05:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
filed a complete application do they
 
05:18:46.550 --> 05:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
have a receipt that they have a
 
05:18:46.560 --> 05:18:47.910 align:start position:0%
have a receipt that they have a
confirmation

05:18:47.910 --> 05:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
confirmation
 
05:18:49.830 --> 05:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
anything that could work to prove that
 
05:18:52.070 --> 05:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
they have gone through the process the
 
05:18:57.430 --> 05:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:59.430 --> 05:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
we receive confirmation in the fact that
 
05:19:01.110 --> 05:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
they may bring in a receipt that they
 
05:19:03.510 --> 05:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
paid for an application
 
05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't indicate approval of that
 
05:19:05.280 --> 05:19:08.310 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't indicate approval of that
application

05:19:08.310 --> 05:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:08.320 --> 05:19:10.788 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:19:10.788 --> 05:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:12.390 --> 05:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up sorry
 
05:19:15.670 --> 05:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
but isn't that the point of this bill is
 
05:19:15.680 --> 05:19:16.628 align:start position:0%
but isn't that the point of this bill is
um

05:19:16.628 --> 05:19:16.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
it's not for people who have an approved
 
05:19:20.070 --> 05:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
application it's people who have a
 
05:19:21.510 --> 05:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
pending application so if they've
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
applied then in fact it is pending
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of the bill
 
05:19:27.190 --> 05:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
05:19:30.708 --> 05:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
and if not i can add on that for you um
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
not all of them get approved either so
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
just the mere fact of applying for it uh
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they're going to get it if
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
you go into the immigration laws it's
 
05:19:40.230 --> 05:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
called frivolous they actually use the
 
05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
word so
 
05:19:43.270 --> 05:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't that helps well but that's
 
05:19:45.430 --> 05:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
why it's a temporary license right
 
05:19:46.948 --> 05:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
05:19:46.958 --> 05:19:49.270 align:start position:0%

committee

we may need a couple extra minutes to
prepare

05:20:18.070 --> 05:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
prepare
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%

05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
make a motion to itl hb 1100. it'll has
 
05:56:54.628 --> 05:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
been moved there's our second
 
05:56:55.510 --> 05:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative seconded by
 
05:56:58.310 --> 05:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative greg i mean i he'll
 
05:56:59.590 --> 05:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to your motion
 
05:57:02.628 --> 05:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um as was
 
05:57:04.470 --> 05:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
discussed this law was changed several
 
05:57:06.390 --> 05:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
years ago after an incident where
 
05:57:08.470 --> 05:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
someone was pulled over for
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
not having a license was written up
 
05:57:14.150 --> 05:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
and soon thereafter plowed into a series
 
05:57:16.310 --> 05:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
of bicycles
 
05:57:16.320 --> 05:57:17.510 align:start position:0%
of bicycles
causing

05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
causing
 
05:57:19.190 --> 05:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
causing damage
 
05:57:21.430 --> 05:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
to various people and
 
05:57:24.230 --> 05:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
i sense that doing this is
 
05:57:25.910 --> 05:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
a slippery slope
 
05:57:28.868 --> 05:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
and by changing this violation moving it
 
05:57:31.750 --> 05:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
from a misdemeanor to a violation is a
 
05:57:33.750 --> 05:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh precedent and a slippery
 
05:57:35.750 --> 05:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
slope so therefore i think we should
 
05:57:37.990 --> 05:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
vote to itl 1100.
 
05:57:39.750 --> 05:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anybody else
 
05:57:41.670 --> 05:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
care to speak to 1100
 
05:57:43.430 --> 05:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
05:57:45.030 --> 05:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:57:46.948 --> 05:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
so i have a slightly
 
05:57:49.190 --> 05:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
different perspective about house bill
 
05:57:49.200 --> 05:57:50.628 align:start position:0%
different perspective about house bill
1100

05:57:50.628 --> 05:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
1100
 
05:57:55.270 --> 05:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:57.510 --> 05:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
i i understand that there were some
 
05:58:00.548 --> 05:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
original motor motivations to pat to
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
change that bill back in i think 2015
 
05:58:08.230 --> 05:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i respect that concern however
 
05:58:11.270 --> 05:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
when we pass laws we we really need to
 
05:58:13.030 --> 05:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
be mindful
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
mindful of
 
05:58:18.070 --> 05:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
who it affects and how many people it
 
05:58:18.080 --> 05:58:20.230 align:start position:0%
who it affects and how many people it
affects

05:58:20.230 --> 05:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
affects
 
05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
eleven hundred is trying to make it
 
05:58:23.990 --> 05:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
possible for
 
05:58:24.000 --> 05:58:25.670 align:start position:0%
possible for
um

05:58:25.670 --> 05:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:27.990 --> 05:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
single working parents
 
05:58:30.390 --> 05:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
others who are are economically
 
05:58:32.628 --> 05:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
challenged we're trying to make the
 
05:58:36.868 --> 05:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
penalty to the penalty there fit their
 
05:58:40.310 --> 05:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
the the crime if you will and far more a
 
05:58:43.110 --> 05:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
far greater number of people
 
05:58:45.110 --> 05:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
are affected by having
 
05:58:48.310 --> 05:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
this be a misdemeanor than a violation
 
05:58:49.830 --> 05:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
than a one-off
 
05:58:51.510 --> 05:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
incident that happened
 
05:58:53.030 --> 05:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
05:58:55.830 --> 05:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
and so no disrespect about
 
05:58:57.830 --> 05:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
all the people who are affected by that
 
05:59:00.708 --> 05:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
one-off incident but we really we really
 
05:59:02.948 --> 05:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
05:59:05.030 --> 05:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the fact that we're but
 
05:59:06.948 --> 05:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
this will help
 
05:59:09.990 --> 05:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
people who can use our help
 
05:59:11.270 --> 05:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:59:13.350 --> 05:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
i would urge uh
 
05:59:13.360 --> 05:59:14.470 align:start position:0%
i would urge uh
to

05:59:14.470 --> 05:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:59:16.470 --> 05:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
vote no on this particular motion so
 
05:59:20.548 --> 05:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:24.150 --> 05:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:26.470 --> 05:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative palersky i just wanted to
 
05:59:28.310 --> 05:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
make one comment of something that came
 
05:59:29.910 --> 05:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
up um i'm not sure it fully came out in
 
05:59:31.350 --> 05:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing but
 
05:59:35.510 --> 05:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
one concern i had was thinking about
 
05:59:37.750 --> 05:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
maybe teenagers going for a joyride
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
we've all known that they've done it a
 
05:59:42.070 --> 05:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
15 year old takes mom's car or someone
 
05:59:44.948 --> 05:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
who hasn't you know finished driver's ed
 
05:59:46.948 --> 05:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:59:49.430 --> 05:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about what that means for
 
05:59:51.510 --> 05:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
college applications applying for the
 
05:59:54.150 --> 05:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
military that kind of thing and um it's
 
05:59:57.670 --> 05:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
a lot for a teenager and i i just i'm
 
05:59:59.110 --> 05:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
just throwing that out there as trying
 
06:00:00.628 --> 06:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
to think of who else this could affect
 
06:00:07.590 --> 06:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:09.030 --> 06:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know if anyone could
 
06:00:10.470 --> 06:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
answer this but
 
06:00:12.390 --> 06:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
if that situation that representative
 
06:00:14.470 --> 06:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
tuliski was talking about i'm looking at
 
06:00:16.230 --> 06:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant back there
 
06:00:21.830 --> 06:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
is it at the discretion of the police
 
06:00:27.190 --> 06:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
officer if they should catch that person
 
06:00:29.990 --> 06:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
that that teenager going for a joyride
 
06:00:30.948 --> 06:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
is it
 
06:00:33.750 --> 06:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
is it your discretion to say hey this is
 
06:00:34.868 --> 06:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
you don't have to
 
06:00:39.910 --> 06:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:44.868 --> 06:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:46.948 --> 06:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
sure representative sykes i appreciate
 
06:00:49.030 --> 06:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
your i didn't i waited a week just to
 
06:00:49.620 --> 06:00:49.630 align:start position:0%
hear from you
 
06:00:49.630 --> 06:00:51.430 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]
 
06:00:53.990 --> 06:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
um i've asked the trooper
 
06:00:56.470 --> 06:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
discretion to write something other than
 
06:00:58.548 --> 06:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
or just discretion to not write at all
 
06:01:01.350 --> 06:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
in other words could he write it as a
 
06:01:01.360 --> 06:01:03.270 align:start position:0%
in other words could he write it as a
violation

06:01:03.270 --> 06:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
violation
 
06:01:05.830 --> 06:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
or does it have to be a misdemeanor if
 
06:01:06.948 --> 06:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
he writes
 
06:01:14.868 --> 06:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:16.708 --> 06:01:16.718 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair um a little more

you've stopped the person
 
06:01:30.390 --> 06:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
06:01:32.070 --> 06:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
likely that they only did the one thing
 
06:01:34.230 --> 06:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
wrong not having a license
 
06:01:36.390 --> 06:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
so if they've had multiple violations
 
06:01:40.390 --> 06:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:43.190 --> 06:01:43.200 align:start position:0%

06:16:50.548 --> 06:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
not one of the five of c3s right sorry
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's not one of the bible's e3's
 
06:16:54.150 --> 06:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
so we're just opening up a i know we
 
06:16:55.350 --> 06:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
opened up with the firefighters but i
 
06:16:56.788 --> 06:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
think this would open door wider for
 
06:16:56.798 --> 06:16:57.510 align:start position:0%
think this would open door wider for
more

06:16:57.510 --> 06:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:16:59.430 --> 06:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
councils and i think it's a bad hole to
 
06:17:01.030 --> 06:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
go down
 
06:17:03.590 --> 06:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
okay fair enough any further discussion
 
06:17:06.390 --> 06:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative tillerson thank you
 
06:17:06.400 --> 06:17:08.948 align:start position:0%
representative tillerson thank you
um

06:17:08.948 --> 06:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:11.270 --> 06:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
i like the idea of this
 
06:17:13.430 --> 06:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
i understand that
 
06:17:14.948 --> 06:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
having a state department as part of
 
06:17:16.708 --> 06:17:16.718 align:start position:0%
this program
 
06:17:22.310 --> 06:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
would be relatively new um but
 
06:17:26.230 --> 06:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:27.990 --> 06:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
primarily because of what we discussed
 
06:17:29.460 --> 06:17:29.470 align:start position:0%
this morning about the
 
06:17:29.470 --> 06:17:31.830 align:start position:0%
this morning about the
[Music]

06:17:31.830 --> 06:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:17:33.750 --> 06:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
financial investment that a group must
 
06:17:35.510 --> 06:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
make to participate in the program that
 
06:17:38.548 --> 06:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
is often not understood
 
06:17:41.190 --> 06:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
understanding the demand that may or may
 
06:17:44.230 --> 06:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
not be existing for a program such as
 
06:17:44.240 --> 06:17:45.190 align:start position:0%
not be existing for a program such as
this

06:17:45.190 --> 06:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:17:45.200 --> 06:17:46.230 align:start position:0%
this
and

06:17:46.230 --> 06:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:17:47.510 --> 06:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
partially because i think of
 
06:17:50.390 --> 06:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of what the program is
 
06:17:51.430 --> 06:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:17:53.670 --> 06:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
with that um
 
06:17:56.070 --> 06:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
i will support the itl and also
 
06:17:58.900 --> 06:17:58.910 align:start position:0%
uh move forward to try to help the
 
06:17:58.910 --> 06:17:59.990 align:start position:0%
uh move forward to try to help the
[Music]

06:17:59.990 --> 06:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:18:01.430 --> 06:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor
 
06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the future if she wants to find a way
 
06:18:05.990 --> 06:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
to um honor the arts in such a way
 
06:18:08.708 --> 06:18:08.718 align:start position:0%
eloquently put representative o'hare
 
06:18:09.830 --> 06:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick question should
 
06:18:11.190 --> 06:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
this be something that we start looking
 
06:18:13.750 --> 06:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
into more as a committee
 
06:18:15.670 --> 06:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal
 
06:18:18.150 --> 06:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
the financial impact of this for these
 
06:18:20.628 --> 06:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
councils and like start i telling them
 
06:18:22.628 --> 06:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
if we feel that they couldn't make it
 
06:18:24.150 --> 06:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
i i'm just it's a question in general
 
06:18:26.868 --> 06:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
off of what she said
 
06:18:26.878 --> 06:18:27.670 align:start position:0%
off of what she said
we

06:18:27.670 --> 06:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:18:29.990 --> 06:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
with what we got from information from
 
06:18:31.750 --> 06:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
the other bill
 
06:18:32.948 --> 06:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to be a question on
 
06:18:34.390 --> 06:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
every one of these we see from here on
 
06:18:34.400 --> 06:18:35.350 align:start position:0%
every one of these we see from here on
and

06:18:35.350 --> 06:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:18:37.110 --> 06:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
whether it was intentional or not i
 
06:18:38.230 --> 06:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
think it's here
 
06:18:43.830 --> 06:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:45.270 --> 06:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll ask the clerk to call
 
06:18:46.468 --> 06:18:46.478 align:start position:0%
the roll
 
06:18:48.628 --> 06:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
when she's ready uh the motion on the
 
06:18:52.390 --> 06:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
floor is itl on hospital 1492.

06:19:53.670 --> 06:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
do a couple more that we heard today
 
06:19:55.110 --> 06:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
it won't be the big ones at the end
 
06:19:56.788 --> 06:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
don't worry
 
06:19:58.948 --> 06:19:58.958 align:start position:0%

06:20:01.270 --> 06:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
decide to move on excuse me give me a
 
06:23:08.830 --> 06:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:08.840 --> 06:23:10.628 align:start position:0%

06:23:12.230 --> 06:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to uh
 
06:23:15.590 --> 06:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
um exec anymore today
 
06:23:18.150 --> 06:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
we did eight plus a reconsideration so
 
06:23:19.990 --> 06:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
we've done our work
 
06:23:21.590 --> 06:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
um just to give you a little game plan
 
06:23:23.670 --> 06:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
of where i was hoping to go it might
 
06:23:27.030 --> 06:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:27.040 --> 06:23:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:23:28.310 --> 06:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:29.830 --> 06:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
so we scheduled today we've done a good
 
06:23:31.990 --> 06:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
job executing as we go
 
06:23:33.270 --> 06:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
next tuesday i'm going to schedule
 
06:23:35.590 --> 06:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
another full day with an exact session
 
06:23:38.310 --> 06:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
we get caught up on these
 
06:23:38.320 --> 06:23:39.270 align:start position:0%
we get caught up on these
i

06:23:39.270 --> 06:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:23:41.190 --> 06:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
at this time not intending on scheduling
 
06:23:43.270 --> 06:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
anything for the week of the 15th
 
06:23:44.548 --> 06:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
because we're going to be in session for
 
06:23:47.110 --> 06:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
two days and two days is enough for most
 
06:23:47.120 --> 06:23:48.948 align:start position:0%
two days and two days is enough for most
people

06:23:48.948 --> 06:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:23:53.430 --> 06:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
and then the 22nd i've reserved the haul
 
06:23:55.830 --> 06:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
originally it was going to be for the
 
06:23:57.510 --> 06:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
two remaining bills that we don't cover
 
06:23:59.430 --> 06:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
next week
 
06:23:59.440 --> 06:24:00.628 align:start position:0%
next week
with

06:24:00.628 --> 06:24:00.638 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:24:04.948 --> 06:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
hp 1000 and hb 1424 which i'm expecting
 
06:24:06.788 --> 06:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
could be a crowd that's the speed limit
 
06:24:08.868 --> 06:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
on winnipesaukee
 
06:24:11.350 --> 06:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
followed by an executive session
 
06:24:13.670 --> 06:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
my goal is to get everything wrapped up
 
06:24:16.310 --> 06:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
by the end of february 22nd that's the
 
06:24:16.320 --> 06:24:17.110 align:start position:0%
by the end of february 22nd that's the
goal

06:24:17.110 --> 06:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
goal
 
06:24:19.750 --> 06:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
if we run if we run into any snags we do
 
06:24:21.990 --> 06:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
have time but that's that's where i want
 
06:24:23.030 --> 06:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
to head
 
06:24:23.040 --> 06:24:24.390 align:start position:0%
to head
so

06:24:24.390 --> 06:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:26.868 --> 06:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:24:28.948 --> 06:24:28.958 align:start position:0%
mr chairman just a reminder just a
 
06:24:31.110 --> 06:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
reminder that committee members that in
 
06:24:34.468 --> 06:24:34.478 align:start position:0%
the office there's the new book
 
06:24:36.390 --> 06:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's not this color it's another color
 
06:24:37.670 --> 06:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
yeah if you look
 
06:24:38.868 --> 06:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
if you look in the desk in there there's
 
06:24:40.868 --> 06:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
two boxes they are purple this year
 
06:24:44.310 --> 06:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:46.070 --> 06:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
