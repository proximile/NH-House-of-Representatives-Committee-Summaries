00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
all right it's uh it's
 
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
1:00 uh with that we should uh convene
 
00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
the division 3 hearing uh we're looking
 
00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 align:start position:0%

uh commissioner overview um and the
 
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
Budget Trailer I is is I think available
 
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's not a lot to it there's like
 
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
five pages maybe 12 items um so we ought
 
00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
to be able to get through that uh for
 
00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
hp71 Mr
 
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
Ripple I want to take the non gerain
 
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that we discussed with
 
00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 align:start position:0%
519 and I want to at the end of the day
 
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
do something with it uh can are we
 
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to discuss it today because I
 
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
don't see it on the calendar and I I I
 
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
was I I I we have discussed it in public
 
00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
right so I guess so I guess for
 
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
clarification do you want to add dis
 
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 align:start position:0%
discuss the
 
00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 align:start position:0%
amendment that you'd previously
 
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
recommended for 519 or the slightly
 
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
different amendment that you had for 71
 
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
it's barely different the only
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
differences are that it fits and now
 
00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
makes it fit with 71 okay
 
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
um all I know is that I had a an email
 
00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 align:start position:0%
conversation with the clerk after after
 
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
our last meeting and he thought before
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
you voted on it um since it's being
 
00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 align:start position:0%
attached to a different bill it would
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
require a new public hearing on a
 
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
non-main Amendment um I don't think that
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
precludes you from discussing anything
 
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
today well I maybe we could just go
 
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
ahead and make a division recommendation
 
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
on it and have the uh full finance
 
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
committee properly noticed so that when
 
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
our recommendation goes to full Finance
 
00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
it can be heard then okay Mr chairman
 
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am I'm sorry to to dispute
 
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
process here but I would be very
 
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable to vote on an amendment
 
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
and division when there requires a
 
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
public hearing I feel that that does not
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
give respect to the public that needs to
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
um come out and speak to the effect of
 
00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment and and I violently agree
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
with you which is why the public hearing
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
will be in front of the full finance
 
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
committee which respects it even more
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
because there'll be more of us available
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
correct so I don't believe that as a
 
00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
division we should discuss it or take a
 
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
vote a division vote today which I
 
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
thought I just heard you say we would do
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
I I hear you and I I'm leaning towards
 
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
taking a vote and you can vote the way
 
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.629 align:start position:0%
taking a vote and you can vote the way
you

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
want I would object on the process there
 
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
all right all right Mr chairman yes a
 
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
point of clarification what are we uh
 
00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 align:start position:0%
voting on the amendment itself I'll get
 
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
to it okay thank you I I'm I was working
 
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
out with with Mr Ripple what what what
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
what what what what is in play and what
 
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
is not and so I I'm I'm ready to make a
 
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
motion to um move uh OTP on House Bill
 
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
71 FN uh with an amendment to be
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
discussed is there a
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
second I'll second that okay uh seconded
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
all right so I think we're supposed to
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
discuss the amendment
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
first um this was the amendment that
 
00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
we've already discussed that was going
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
to be part of
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
519 uh nothing material has changed from
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
519 uh so we we have discussed and it
 
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 align:start position:0%
was uh did already have a public Hearing
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
in uh that
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
context um and in that meeting we said
 
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
that uh we would be trying to attach it
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
to 71 out of respect for
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
519 and so uh with get that uh in place
 
00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does is exactly what
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
we said it would do um it uh it tells
 
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.350 align:start position:0%
we said it would do um it uh it tells
the

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 align:start position:0%
department that for contracts all of
 
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
their contracts or addenda should
 
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 align:start position:0%
include a provision requiring the
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
contractor to comply with the patient
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights pursuant to RSA 151 colon
 
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
21 it sets up a repeal same as the other
 
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
one uh relative to DH HS contracts um
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
will will uh will repeal wait a second
 
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
section okay and so it sets up a repeal
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
so that this requirement expires
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
November 30th
 
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
2026 I want to require to get it into
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
the law but I don't want to keep the law
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
hanging around forever uh because it
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
should at some point just become
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
practice and then because we're sticking
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
it in
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
71 71
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh needed to have its effective date uh
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
changed and it stays the same line 17
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
the remainder of this act shall take
 
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days after its passage which
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
is what is said on line 20 of the bill
 
00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:17.629 align:start position:0%
is what is said on line 20 of the bill
so

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
um so that is the amendment
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative tersi I just wanted to go
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
back to what we discussed last week
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
which is I believe we all agreed that
 
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919 align:start position:0%
this amendment as drafted um met our
 
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
needs yes to the First non- gerain
 
00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919 align:start position:0%
Amendment so we all felt really felt
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
good with this however we I have written
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
here on the top that we need the non-
 
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
derain amendment full hearing that needs
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
scheduled in order to then attach it to
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
71 so I guess I am just confused I
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
thought today we were coming to discuss
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
House Bill 71 so so we are discussing 71
 
00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:03.639 align:start position:0%
the be the underlying uh uh motion was
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
to uh move 71 as an OTP and with an a
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
with an amendment and this is the
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
amendment we're discussing yeah can can
 
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
you tell me substantially what's
 
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
different now remember I'm doing this
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
for you guys I app I could have stuck
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
this on to 519 and ignored I 100% am
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
saying that I AG could use a little bit
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
of leeway now just to get this off of
 
00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:30.919 align:start position:0%
our plate
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
I'm just clarifying that we can't get
 
00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
this off of our plate until we have a
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
non-gain hearing on this amendment okay
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
I understood the work session today was
 
00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:42.039 align:start position:0%
to talk about the underlying bill that's
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
why I'm confused and trying to clarify
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
the point of this meeting that was
 
00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:48.519 align:start position:0%
scheduled at 1 p.m do you do you see any
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
substant substantive difference between
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment as proposed today on
 
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
0416 hotel and what we had last week
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
week that uh I had intended to attach to
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
519 you see anything substantively
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
different yes yes represent wner go
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
ahead I don't see anything different
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
about it my only question
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
is what if just what if someone showed
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
up at the non-main amendment
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
hearing with some sort of new
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
information and that and here we have
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
already acted
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
on the non-main amendment before we've
 
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
had the hearing and that I think is what
 
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
confusing I think we have a calendaring
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
issue I wish it would have been on
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
today's calendar um but uh I didn't make
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
sure that that happened I think we can
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
fix it by saying that there'll be a non
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
gerine Amendment hearing on the next
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
full Finance are we meeting tomorrow yes
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
but but it's too late to put the
 
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
non-main amendment tomorrow also right
 
00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
well the division is meeting tomorrow
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
but the non-gain amendment hearing would
 
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
be before the full committee which and
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
as far as I know the full committee
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a uh an upcoming meeting
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled so so can we add it to the
 
00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:25.959 align:start position:0%
next and today we're just making a
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation the non gerain Amendment
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
hearing can be done done
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
on the F First full finance committee my
 
00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:36.639 align:start position:0%
my plan was to schedule it for the next
 
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
meeting of the full finance committee
 
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:44.829 align:start position:0%
meeting of the full finance committee
yes

00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah okay we'll we'll I think we can do
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
that and then uh I want to change my uh
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh motion on
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
hp71 and uh I vote I would like to move
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
to retain it
 
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
until after we get the non gerain
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment heard and because I want to
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
attach it to 71 so I don't I don't think
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
I can move 71 today because it won't be
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
around to stick the non gerain Amendment
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
on later is that
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
right this is just a work session I
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
believe Mr chairman I know to discuss
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
base the base bill of 71 about that the
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
content of it and the fiscal note on the
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
base bill of 71 because we had questions
 
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.430 align:start position:0%
base bill of 71 because we had questions
last

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
week you you had questions on 71 yeah
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll come back to 71 I'm I'm just
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
trying to uh figure out how to get these
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
two uh put together I don't believe we
 
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
have to take any official action today
 
00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
as a division on the bill or the
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
amendment is what I'm the the thing I
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
want to see happen is I want to see us
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
get to the floor uh at some point as
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible with 71 with an
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
otpa of of this
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh previously known your main amendment
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
I want to do an otpa on 71 with this
 
00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
amendment that's where I want to end
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
up correct okay
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
so so I don't know that we can do
 
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
anything more today on the non gerain
 
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment other than to schedule it for
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
the First full full finance committee is
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct okay so so
 
00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
today I think that would likely be the
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the clerk all right so
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to withdraw my Amendment uh
 
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:37.370 align:start position:0%
that means the second needs to be
 
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.550 align:start position:0%
that means the second needs to be
[Music]

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
withdrawn I'll withdraw the second okay
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
so so now we need a new motion on uh on
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
71 and I since I don't want to see this
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
voted on I want it to discussed today so
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
that we can have it available to attach
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment to later so so so what
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
would be the proper motion for
 
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
that I I don't think you need a motion
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh this being a work session you could
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
just discuss whatever aspects of the
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
bill you want to very good so we're
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to go into a work session on
 
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 71 FN do you have a question
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
that was it that was my clarification
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
that this is just a work session and we
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
can jump right in there's no vote today
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
this is just a work
 
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.550 align:start position:0%
this is just a work
session

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
Stringham Stringham I I appreciate and
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
understand everything you're saying I
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
say it's not necessary for division 3 to
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
ever uh speak out on hp71 and still have
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
the bill whether amended or not amended
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
emerg from Finance it can go directly to
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
finance without uh having having had us
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh act on it but you can decide or we
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
whe whether we need to after the
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
non-gain amendment is introduced
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
whatever it is whether we have to meet
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
as uh division three and make a make a
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
vote but it could go straight to finance
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
for final vote my understanding of the
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
process okay I'll I'll we'll have time
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
I'll have time to to figure that out
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
with the clerk and all um but I
 
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:11.759 align:start position:0%
appreciate your uh input I think we'll
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
be okay if we schedule the amendment for
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
the to be heard in full finance and if
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
we don't send 71 to full Finance yet
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
then we can come back to a subsequent
 
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
division three and make a recommendation
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
then so in the second full finance
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
committee there'll be a properly formed
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%

priest yes thank you Mr chairman for
 
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
being here um my question is it's my
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
understanding that we would be losing or
 
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
potentially losing
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
8.5 I'm sorry 12 to18 million a year if
 
00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed is that correct so
 
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
the our our fiscal analysis was based on
 
00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
the term used within the bill that said
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
specified alien where we could not find
 
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
a direct definition but when we looked
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
into the definition of specified alien
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
in the um act it with included in the
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
bill it referred to any person who's a
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
non- US Citizen and So based on that
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
including all non- US citizens we
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
included both our HUD funding and our
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
office of refugee resettlement funding
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
that could be potentially affected by
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
that definition and so we have been able
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
to pull exactly what we have for our
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
actuals from 24 as well as our project
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
projected budget and that's why that
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
range and where that comes from follow
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
for taking this followup is this a
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
problem now in in local communities are
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
is are our local schools being flooded
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
by immigrants and people asking for
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
Asylum that you know about we have no
 
00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
time other questions represent
 
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
Daniels thank you i' like to take a
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
definition one step further you've
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
identified an alien as a non- US citizen
 
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
could you identify what an
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
alien who has not been admitted into the
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
United States is so it was not clear in
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
our analysis of this definition to that
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
our understanding we had to use just the
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
term alien because that's what was in
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
definition that's referred to within the
 
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
bill um let me just reference
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
back that you
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
just did this over to me right I have
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
too many
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so where it says
 
00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
specified alien within House Bill 71 is
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
the immigration and nationality act um
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
in in section
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
111a and so I when we look up that
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
definition there's a definition under
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
alien but I did not see a definition
 
00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
under specified alien and so that is why
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
we uh interpreted it more broadly to
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
that where it says alien within that
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
section refers to any person who is not
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
so if we have misanalyzed that we can
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
then do a different fiscal analysis but
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
that was our what we're basing that our
 
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.510 align:start position:0%
that was our what we're basing that our
assumptions

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
assumptions
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
on would you agree that there's a
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
difference between an alien who has been
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
admitted to the us and one who has not
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
been admitted to the us correct and so
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's why this could potentially
 
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
prohibit the use of shelters um for
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
those who who have been admitted to the
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
US and
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
including the refugees and so when we
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
looked at those populations the policy
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
could create some disparities in the
 
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
treatment of refugees which um would be
 
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
would be problematic and those who have
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
that are considered non US citizens but
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
legally U represent seaworth thank you
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman I
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
get understand this in a little more
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
detail if I understand what you just
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
said you're concerned about the
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
definition in this bill and potential
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the with the federal law
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
and you believe that that conflict might
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
cause you to lose the
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
money um and I'm I'm trying to
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
understand the mechanism for that is it
 
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
because the de is it because of the
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
mismatch in definitions or that you are
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
concerned that when you interpret this
 
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
definition you'll do it wrong and
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
therefore the federal government will
 
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
take action under federal law I it
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
because of the mismatch because it feels
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
like as though without the list of sort
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
of what is specified or a clearer
 
00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
definition of what is specified then we
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
um are interpreting it more broadly and
 
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
then it would include refugees which is
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
that $3 to8 million range and then also
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
include potential HUD funding as well so
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
um with excluding certain groups that
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
are not undocumented not here
 
00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
undocumented including those that are
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for the office of refugee
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
resettlement populations the policy
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
could create some disparities in the
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
treatment of refugees and that may make
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
that funding be at risk and and I guess
 
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
I'm again I'm trying to get a just a
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
so excluded from what the fact that you
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
can't put that person into a school is
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
what will cause that money to
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
disappear and and that's why we use the
 
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039 align:start position:0%
word may we do not know that it would
 
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
but it would go against the intent of
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
the of the
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
funding to not be able to shelter folks
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
that are here documented and then part
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
of the refugee program would put at risk
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of that funding the those it
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
includes people that are fleeing more in
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
violence and the intent of the funding
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
is to is to create safety and so not
 
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
allowing a uh Sheltering of those folks
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
could potentially put a risk that
 
00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.510 align:start position:0%
could potentially put a risk that
funding

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
and again keep going thank you and
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
specifically in the federal language the
 
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
schools are this is specific to schools
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the federal language no this is
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
General yes the federal language that I
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
was referencing is within House Bill 71
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
that they did not find a definition of
 
00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:07.830 align:start position:0%
that they did not find a definition of
specified

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
specified
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
alien do you have other questions I got
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
have have we ever have anywhere in the
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
United States has the federal government
 
00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:18.350 align:start position:0%
United States has the federal government
directed

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
directed
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
Sheltering in um a public school
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
chartered public school public Academy
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
or institution of Higher Learning have
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
we has the federal government ever
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
directed directed that those types of
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
facilities be used as shelter I don't
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
have the answer to that question I
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
imagine in cases of disaster that they
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
have but I'm not sure so let's assume no
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
because we have to assume something here
 
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
and and so wouldn't it be true that as
 
00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:47.799 align:start position:0%
long as we found adequate shelter to
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
support a refugee
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
request that it wouldn't interfere with
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
this money if we chose not to use our
 
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
schools if we found Alterna ative
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
adequate shelters we would still comply
 
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
with the order and we'd still be
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
eligible for the money would we not I
 
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
think we just don't know if there's a
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
need or a mandate or that necessitates
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
the need to open school facilities so
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
we're because it has not been an issue
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
in the past we don't have an example to
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
point to and and looking into the
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future over the next four
 
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
years do you imagine the federal
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
government directing any refugees be
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
housed in a public school chartered
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
public school public Academy or
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
institution of Higher Learning could do
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
you do you even imagine that to be a
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
realistic possibility I I would not make
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
an assumption about what happen I know
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's not for you as much as it is for
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
us so um all are there other are there
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
Stringham uh are there times in the case
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
of an uh natural disaster that uh the
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
least expensive uh location might be
 
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh a public education institution and if
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
that that was uh not available that you
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
would have to use something that would
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
cost us and hence the federal government
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
more money on your existing
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
contracts potentially our our regional
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
public health networks have emergency
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
preparedness plans that do include
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
school buildings so if they're not
 
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:22.039 align:start position:0%
available that might change the cost of
 
00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
what it is how did uh if followup would
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
be how how did you come up with 12 to 18
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
million as the is that the size of the
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
current contracts that you have with HUD
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
and and the um uh office of ref Refugee
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
resettlement that represent 100% of
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
those contracts yes so we just utilized
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
our existing funding from these two
 
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
sources that we thought could
 
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
potentially be impacted and we did pull
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
um those accounting units for you all
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
for today well thank
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
Tori thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
question um I'm not sure if you're the
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
person to answer this but I'm going to
 
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
put out the question that we had last
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
week which was what in what does the
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
term institution facilities
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
mean do we know I do not know okay um
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up to that would be um if
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
this if you believe that this as written
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
applies to um private institutions of
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
Higher Learning also say St angelum
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
College Riv College in nasua or is it
 
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
just public higher institutions of
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
learning and I guess by extension I
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
could say how about private schools in
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
um the state could they
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
shelter as I read it I interpret the the
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
final you know section there it says
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
institution of Higher Learning or
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
facilities of a schools or institution
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
which is very broad there is
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
specifically public and public charter
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
and public Academy me but that secondary
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
language is Broad and it does not say
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
public on Higher Learning that's what I
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
thought thank you very much for
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
that are are there other
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you for coming
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
so so I guess I I have another it this
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
sort of uh jumps out at me is it's it
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
the last sentences and I know LBA wrote
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
this but I think they did this on input
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
in the worst case scenario in which all
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
such funding were withheld the
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
department estimates the loss of federal
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
revenue well aren't there others oh
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
she's gone Miss Higgins Miss Higgins oh
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
Higgins I'm sorry I I I I changed my
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
mind as you were walking from the table
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
so so I maybe maybe you uh had some
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
insight on this worst case scenario
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
language in the final sentence of the
 
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.310 align:start position:0%
language in the final sentence of the
fiscal

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
note it says in the worst case scenario
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
in which all such funding were withheld
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
the department estimates the loss of
 
00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:03.559 align:start position:0%
federal revenue at 12 to 18 million per
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
year so so that documents the worst case
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
scenario did the department have an
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
opinion on what the most likely scenario
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
is and and what the best case scenario
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
is I I mean I really just hate operating
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
off of a a single worst case scenario as
 
00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
though dysfunction is is
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
inevitable U no I thank you for your
 
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
question I I think what we did was in
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
order to because this is not something
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
that we've had happen before in order to
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
give you a sense of where it could
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
potentially impact we simply pulled the
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
full funding of those two funding
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
sources from the office of refugee
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
resettlement and the HUD funding so
 
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
you're only looking at that total with
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
potential supplemental we don't have a
 
00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:53.519 align:start position:0%
sense of if of impact it was a May would
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
it be reasonable for us as a committee
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
you think to be thinking that they're
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
probably is also a best case scenario
 
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
and a most probable scenario that aren't
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
that isn't written into the fiscal note
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
potentially I think we're we are not
 
00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:09.559 align:start position:0%
saying that this will be a loss
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely or that this is a direct
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
impact but just that that it could
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
potentially go against the intent of
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
those two pieces of funding we do not we
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
have a requirement federally on our fud
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
on our HUD funding the um Housing and
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
Urban Development funding source the
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
requirement H is to to shelter with no
 
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
precondition and no barrier and so we
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
that you know and then the office of
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
refugee resettlement funding has
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
specific conditions as well um that make
 
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
sure to just keep people safe and So
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
based on the language in those two
 
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
pieces we thought there could be
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
potential impact and again we gave you
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
the full amount not saying that all of
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
that would be at risk but that these are
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
the funding sources that this bill could
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
potentially impact right when when they
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
say Sheltering with no barrier does does
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
does does that mean that people could be
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
directed to shelter in their own home to
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
to have refugees sent into private homes
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't right there there there
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
are barriers to what shelters we select
 
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
what what what constitutes a violation
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
of the of the of the the thought that we
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
should not have barriers to shelters so
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
there is typically in this instance
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
there there are certain barrier there
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
are certain things that are considered
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
barriers by Hud and in this instance the
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
HUD funding typically prioritizes US
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
citizens and and eligible non-citizens
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
and there are Provisions for some
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
noncitizens particularly those with Leal
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
legal status so that includes refugees
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
or lawful permanent residents that
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
they're able to access um housing
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
assistance and shelter and so these
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
individuals who are lawfully present in
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
the United States such as green card
 
00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.710 align:start position:0%
the United States such as green card
holders

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
holders
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
um those seeking Asylum and certain
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
other categories of individual with of
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
individuals with immigration status
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
recognized by the US government and so
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
the in the again it's in the
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the definition of of
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
alien it goes back to that again because
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
there are these categories that are
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
outside of um US citizen that are still
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
lawfully present and that if we were
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
impacting those lawfully present that
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
are not US citizens that would be the
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
potential conflict with the intent of
 
00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
the funding sources sure I but I think I
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
just heard you in in that to to to say
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
that it would be permissible if there
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
was a natural disaster kind of thing and
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
we had to shelter us residents New
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents if we had some sort
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
of a priority for limited shelter space
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
and we gave first priority to New
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents that we could give
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
secondary or third priority to people in
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
I hear you and I'm not disagreeing I
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
validate that but I also believe that in
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
terms of disaster we often don't have
 
00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
identification so we we don't it's just
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
not how we operate emergency shelter is
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
to look for um people's status it's just
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
to keep people safe because in terms of
 
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
disaster many of us may leave our home
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
in you know fires or floods or whatever
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
without identification and so
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
prioritizing like that could potentially
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
put any or all of us at
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
risk okay any new questions
 
00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
representative stringam it sounds like U
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
as a possible uh remedy to the passage
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill you may have to rework your
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
emergency uh preparedness program uh
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
since the um uh essentially schools
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
would no longer be an appropriate place
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
for these for anybody because you don't
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
know that everybody meets the standards
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
set by the state of New Hampshire um I
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
assume there would be a cost to revising
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
the preparedness plans to exclude
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
schools and that there may be some
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
impact on on the preparedness plan to be
 
00:32:15.389 --> 00:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
effective uh you know should a
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
circumstance uh like a natural disaster
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
emerge that that that's being done do
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
you think that's a reasonable response
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
to this bill um and um uh as WR and um
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh to to uh make sure that you can
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
comply and not lose these contracts so I
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
honestly feel like I would have to ask
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
our colleagues in public health that
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
oversee emergency preparedness that
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
question as we are a large department
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm from behavioral he so I do feel
 
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
like it's a reasonable question but I
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
don't feel like I'm the right person to
 
00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.830 align:start position:0%
don't feel like I'm the right person to
answer

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
it are there other questions represented
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
Daniels thank you you you mentioned that
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
specified alien uh can mean in part
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
those lawfully present would would they
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
also include those unlawfully
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
present the whole analysis is really
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that there isn't a
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
definition of specified alien so I think
 
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you said there is not a
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
definition right I could not find a
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
definition of specified alien so we did
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
this analysis based on the definition of
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
alien so if there's a definition of
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
specified alien which is
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
different then we could look at that
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
separately the B seems to indicate that
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
there is a definition who has been
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
admitted as so defined going back to the
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
whole federal statute correct and when I
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
looked in the federal statute I did not
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
locate specified alien only the
 
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
alien if someone else has seen that
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
specified alien definition and would
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
provide it to us that could have been my
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
misstep but I did the analysis based on
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
um the best information that I could
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
find and the definition was of the word
 
00:33:57.279 --> 00:34:00.389 align:start position:0%
find and the definition was of the word
alien

00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry are so you're saying that
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
if we were to look at section 101a of
 
00:34:09.729 --> 00:34:09.739 align:start position:0%
the immigration nationality act section
 
00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:10.790 align:start position:0%
the immigration nationality act section
[Music]

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
1101a that the those things don't exist
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
those references don't exist or the or
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
at the reference we still don't have a
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
definition specified alien the
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
definition is of alien and then I don't
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
know if the term specified means
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
something else within there I just there
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't a way so alien is defined in
 
00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
those sections correct so the analysis
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
is based on the the definition of alien
 
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
within that
 
00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:38.839 align:start position:0%
National I'm sorry I'm just being
 
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
slow all right representative um
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
seaworth thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
again I don't know the background on
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
this so what I see here is line 11 we've
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
defined at the state level a new term it
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
means something for the state specified
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
alien and is this normal that it if we
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
try to use terms that aren't defined in
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
the same way by the federal government
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
we can't we can't have our own
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
definitions is that kind of the
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
background to this no I believe we can
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
we can have our own definition we we
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
would have to still be in line with
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
federal law but we can Define it okay I
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
think I think we're going to have to get
 
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor in here because I think
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
what they tried to do was Define alien
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
but then to say this specified part is
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
the back portion of the sentence that
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
says who's not been admitted so you take
 
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
an alien and then you you modify it to
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
say specified alien and you're
 
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
specifying that they have not been
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
admitted into the United States so I
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
think that's the they're stumbling
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
around you know the Goda ways the
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants all the normal Al
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
language that many of us uh use when
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking to one another trying to
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
find a legal way of saying that but I
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
think what they're trying to say is we
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
don't know we don't want to House people
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
uh that are not here in a proper legal
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
status and there's lots of proper legal
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
statuses but it looks like they're
 
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
trying to find one where there is an
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
absence of legal status so I think we
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
got to get the bill sponsor in here
 
00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.790 align:start position:0%
got to get the bill sponsor in here
represent

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman again uh
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to walk through a
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
scenario um which I think why this bill
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
is here um I have not spoken with this
 
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor um but it's it's seems like it's
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
a kind of relating to an emergency a
 
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.470 align:start position:0%
a kind of relating to an emergency a
short-term

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
disaster um and you know short-term
 
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
disasters are defined here by you know
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
flood fire hurricane
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
tornado um high water earthquake
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
snowstorm all of these have been part of
 
00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:10.069 align:start position:0%
snowstorm all of these have been part of
New

00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's history in the past and when
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
this happens to a large area and a large
 
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
group of people are affected they
 
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
usually direct them to the um schools
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
because that's where schools have
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
generators and hot water and facilities
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
for a shortterm basis and they even
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
Define this not to exceed 72 hours so
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
represent priest my question is this I I
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
had a question about your question
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
though if you look if you look at uh
 
00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
line eight and nine it it seems to me
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
like it says it does not include
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
short-term emergency shelter so every
 
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
point that you just made was beautifully
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
made made and I agree with it but I
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's applicable to this
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
discussion so this is my question
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
because it is kind of confusing why they
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
Define this when it's for longer
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
durations well because they don't want I
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing because we don't have the
 
00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor here but what I think they're
 
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to say like in the
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
hotels in in uh Manhattan in New York
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
City that have been basically almost
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
permanently turned over to house
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
migrants that what they're trying to do
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
is if there's a longer term shelter
 
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
requirement uh beyond beyond what they
 
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
call a short-term emergency that the
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
schools aren't to be used for people who
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
are here without legal authorization but
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
but if the dis if you know if there is a
 
00:38:50.309 --> 00:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
disaster can they use them for shelter
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
for the residents Beyond 72
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
hours I don't know let's get the sponsor
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
in uh any other question Mr chair I
 
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
think it would be also good to have
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
someone legal here to see if if we're
 
00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.589 align:start position:0%
someone legal here to see if if we're
going

00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
against yeah you know but the other
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
thing is I keep getting chastised in the
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
past years of trying to take on policy
 
00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
the policy has been we're just dealing
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
with we're just supposed to be dealing
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal and understanding the
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal note so I I I I think we should
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
entertain all the questions that may
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
impact our interpretation of the fiscal
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
note but I don't I want to be careful
 
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
not to revisit the policy too
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
strenuously representative
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
walner all right so I interrupted you
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
did you want to continue your question
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
no you you basically um
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
clarified uh the question that I had I
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
because I because I see in the law the
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
the ability to interpret it to say I
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
don't care who you are if if there's an
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
emergency you can do emergency shelter
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
of anyone but if you're beyond an
 
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
emergency Sheltering then then the
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a it seems like there's a
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on people not here legally
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
from using the
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
schools that's correct but but that is
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
my conjecture based on a lot of
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
conjecture representative seaworth thank
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chairman I and I would agree
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
with your conjecture and I I think I'm
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
not saying we shouldn't talk to the
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor but we can also read the plain
 
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
language of the bill that passed the
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
house I would agree with your
 
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
interpretation on line of line six or of
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
line eight uh I would also read the
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
plain language of line six which says
 
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
that all we're talking about here is
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
emergency Selter housing provided
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
exclusively to specified
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
aliens um so
 
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
again we can speculate well what if this
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
means all kinds of things that aren't
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
written here but I find the language
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
pretty specific when I read the bill and
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
so it frustrates me to say well what if
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean exclusively what if
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
they really mean everybody in a town who
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
who shows up for emergency shelter well
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
then obviously to me it wouldn't be
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
those exclusively provided to specified
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
aliens all right so
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
than so representative priest you look
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
like you want to say
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
more I representative n vono yeah I want
 
00:41:40.349 --> 00:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
to come I want to come back to the risk
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
analysis or risk assessment on the
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
financial end of this H have have we
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
ever lost complete funding for a program
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
for similar kinds of
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
reasons I don't know I think this was
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
provided based on would we be out of
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
compliance with the objective of the
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
funding so may I so as a followup to
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
that so typically you'd have some period
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
of time when you could you know um I'm
 
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get my head around is the
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario uh which would would
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
mean losing all of the funding because
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
some technical violation of the uh of of
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
the contracts or the policy and
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
typically that you know there'd be a
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
interim case where somebody would say we
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
think you're you're doing something
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's inv violation of the contract but
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
the worst case seems like it would throw
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
the baby out with the bathwater uh from
 
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
the standpoint of of at least uh
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
directionally for the bulk of the people
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
involved be
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
providing uh the spec specified services
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
so I I think I come back to what
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
chairman Edwards was asking was that
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem the worst case doesn't seem
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
like even close to a a most likely case
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
and so when you when you go to look at
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
the risk analysis you say Okay U 100%
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
loss is on one end of the spectrum and
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
the best case is it's a it's a waiver
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
situation where they say well
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
technically you're you're in violation
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
of the of the letter of it but we'll
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
wave it because the greater good is
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
providing uh the services to the bulk of
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
the people is that is that a
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
fair assessment again I'm not sure we
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
can make I can make an assumption about
 
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not the federal funding would
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
be at risk it was our analysis was that
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
the risk was indeterminable and the
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
range that we provided you is our
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
current award so again it's not we don't
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
have an amount that that outside of this
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
is the award and that the bill as
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
written in our interpretation would be
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
in direct conflict with Federal guidance
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
on providing shelter um and or in
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
conflict with Federal funding and Grant
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
obligations as they're written today so
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
then we gave the en the entirety of the
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
awards under both places for your
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
consideration but with the caveat that
 
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
it just may be an impact and that we're
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
not suggesting it would be the full
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
amount but we're just making sure you
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
have the all of the information that we
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
have and then everything else would be
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
some guess work right I understand that
 
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of an extreme uh at the
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
extreme end of what could happen but but
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
the most well I don't want to say the
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
most likely but there are um ranging all
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
the way from as I said a case where
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
nothing happens and you get a waiver
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
because some small piece of the language
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
was technically in violation uh to
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
something you know greater or lesser
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
than the uh zero case or the full full
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
loss of funding case but I I'm trying to
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
remember from my own uh I'm not sure
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
I've ever seen any kind of a scenario
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
where uh uh full funding was totally uh
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
withdrawn on a program unless that
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
unless you have an example of that I
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
don't have an example of that I know
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
that in the way that the current bill is
 
00:45:20.549 --> 00:45:20.559 align:start position:0%
written includes those who are here
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
lawfully and therefore would also be a a
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
federal civil rights violation so
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
there's multiple kind of layers to the
 
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
way it's defined today that would be um
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
concerning to this this funding source
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
but if there's some amount of clarity
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
that is offered within the bill then we
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
would go back and rework that
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
analysis okay okay real good anybody
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
else for this witness thank you so very
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
much I'm sure we will have further
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
questions perhaps especially when this
 
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
bill will have another work session
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
scheduled so we'd welcome you back at
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
that point Thank you absolutely at this
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
point I want to direct your attention
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know when we last met on this bill I
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
came in at the tail end there and I
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
asked Mr Ripple to please provide the
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
precise accounting units that were
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
referenced and referred to in this bill
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
which he did so if you look at your
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
emails at precisely 12:12 p.m.
 
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
today he sent to all of us the exact
 
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
units we were looking for so there are
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
two I know we're getting ahead of
 
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
ourselves because we will have plenty of
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
time to go through all of the lines
 
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
however uh the two here are Health and
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
Human Services naturally the
 
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office Behavioral Health
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
and then we get into the office of the
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner and homeless and housing Mr
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
Ripple do you want to just briefly give
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
any remark with regards to these two

all right it's uh it's a one minute P
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
two uh we're going division 3 is going
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
to come out of recess uh we're going to
 
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
begin a budget work session this is the
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
first time we're looking at numbers uh
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's the DHHS commissioner's overview
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
and then um subsequent to that we'll
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
walk through um the trailer bill that we
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
have so um with that I I know that the
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner is away today and I believe
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
Dr Hanah and Mr White will come in and
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
um now one of the things I'm I'm hoping
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to do uh Mr White
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
is uh you I know we have uh the nice U
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
pretty documents here uh I'd like to be
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
able to uh have us Trace along and stick
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
our finger in the big nasty book along
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
with the nice Graphics so so can you
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
tell us what page and the big budget
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
binder we're going to be starting out
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
sure So today we're we're actually going
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
to be looking at numbers through a
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
couple of different lenses that are
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
aggregate there's some analyses that
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
that I worked on um after the governor's
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
budget was released to try to get better
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
perspective on uh how our budget is
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
funded in some of the complexities um
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
and then tomorrow we're going to be
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
going into the details of all of oom as
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
far as the operations Finance legal HR
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
facilities um we'll be going through
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
each of those detail by detail tomorrow
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay so today isn't about the the big
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
budget binder this is about your
 
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
separate analyses and the presentation
 
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
correct yeah we've only had about one
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
full uh business day with the governor's
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
budget so we're working on those
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
presentations finalizing making sure all
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
the numbers are accurate for tomorrow
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
okay I could have saved myself a Heria
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
of bringing that but representative
 
01:05:15.269 --> 01:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
walner thank you
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
um so one thing that I'm interested in
 
01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
in every every is part of the budget is
 
01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh your priority requests and I wondered
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
how we would be able to I know I can go
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
to the to the 3,000 page document that
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
was online for a while um but is there a
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
way we will be able to see that those by
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
division yes um and and I apologize I I
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
didn't introduce myself to start Nathan
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
white Chief Financial Officer with the
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
um what we've done we've tried to
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
standardize our budget presentation
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
templates and at the back of each one
 
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
we've tried to to leave a section for
 
01:05:59.710 --> 01:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
those prioritized needs so that um the
 
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
committee has an understanding of sort
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
of what what was funded and what was not
 
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
funded at the by the governor so you
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
have that record
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%

wanted to thank you for the opportunity
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
over the last two weeks to come and do
 
01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.150 align:start position:0%
over the last two weeks to come and do
some

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
non-numbers um conversations uh we hope

you found that helpful um and so I won't
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
belabor the introductory slides but it
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
seemed important to acknowledge kind of
 
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
the core reason we're here and why uh
 
01:06:46.349 --> 01:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
this this funding matters um obviously
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
our our vision and Mission and values
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully came across in those
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
presentations and the fact that we do a
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff we do a lot of things um
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
from education and Service delivery to
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
health and safety protections and
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
Regulatory oversight um on slide four we
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
have sort of our best um attempt as we
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
talked with you uh a couple weeks about
 
01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
ago at uh listing out our our core um
 
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
divisions and so um just want to uh also
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledge um you know how much you
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
heard and as a recap um you know you
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
heard from uh let's see we had Trish
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
chly here who talked about the
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health System of
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
care which really crosses several of
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
these divisions in blue um we also heard
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
from uh we've heard from our Medicaid
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
leadership from um Anne Landry we heard
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
from um chrisan anello on developmental
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities long-term services and
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
supports we also had Meredith tus and um
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
Dave weeders here talking about
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and data and program
 
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
Integrity so I think what I want to
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
emphasize as we begin getting into to
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
the numbers is that our team is highly
 
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
integrated um when we speak pretty
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
regularly with other states they're
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
pretty amazed at how much goes on Under
 
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
One Roof we believe that's a real
 
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
strength of ours um the fact that we can
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
walk down the hallway and have a
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
conversation between division directors
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
to problem solve and to ensure that
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're operating in the most effective
 
01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
but also very lean way possible another
 
01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
element that supports that um
 
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
integration and that efficiency is
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
Illustrated on Slide Five which is
 
01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
making sure we always know our true
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
north um our uh our road map sometimes
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
in other states called A business plan
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
is meant to help us keep our eye on what
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
is most important to the people we serve
 
01:08:46.349 --> 01:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
um as well as how we invest in our own
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
people so they come and stay and do good
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
work and deliver the customer service
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
and the efficiency um that people should
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
expect um so a progress report on that
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
plan should be out any day um to help
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
get at some of the questions you've
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
asked around what's the return on
 
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
investment and the impact that we're
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
demonstrating through this work so
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
that's all I wanted to say by way of
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
introduction is thank you for having us
 
01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
the last two weeks and for the
 
01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
thoughtfulness of your questions um we
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
believe what we do is important um we
 
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
believe what we do is um vast in scope
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
but we also believe um like you we're
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
committed to doing it with great
 
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
efficiency and a commitment to being um
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
relatively easy to work with for the
 
01:09:29.309 --> 01:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
consumer and for partners alike so
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
thanks for having us and excited to dive
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
into uh some numbers today with Nathan's
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
help excellent if you if you turn to the
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
next page um you will see a uh a couple
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
of circles there and the title is DHHS
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
budget complexity um for new members to
 
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
this committee that that have uh not
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
been through this process with uh with
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
dhs's budget there's just a couple of
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
things that I I want to touch on because
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
um DHHS is budget it is large it is
 
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
complex and it is integrated and um some
 
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
of the complexity allows us to uh to
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
essentially maximize the federal funds
 
01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
that are available to us um however we
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
do have hundreds of well over a hundred
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
different Federal funding sources and
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
other funding sources and with some of
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
those funding sources there are specific
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
requirements that come with those and if
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
you um if you turn to the left there
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
you'll see a couple of bullets across
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
the left number one is cost allocation
 
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
so one thing that kind of sits behind
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
the scenes that the legislature isn't
 
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
really involved in on a day-to-day basis
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
is our Public Assistance cost allocation
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
plan and what that basically is it's a
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
200 I think we're at 260 page document
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
that we developed and what it does is it
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
defines the methodology that we use to
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
attribute certain activities to
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
different federal funds so certain
 
01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
positions in our department are paid
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
with over a hundred different Federal
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
funding sources and we're able to do
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
that because we have this Fally approved
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
cost allocation plan we also use um we
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
use random moment studies and random
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
time studies to check on on certain
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
individuals and certain positions to
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
make sure what's the type of work that
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
you're doing okay we can claim fore for
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
that what's the type of work you're
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
doing okay we could claim Medicaid for
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
that so that we can maximize those
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
federal funds that are available um and
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
not use General funds and that's a
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
really important thing to understand but
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
one of the downsides to that I think
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
just from a budgetary perspective from
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
the seats that you're sitting in is if
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
you do unfund certain positions then
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
you're no longer to earn those federal
 
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
dollars in those positions and then I'm
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
kind of I'm kind of skipping ahead uh to
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
the second piece there maintenance of
 
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
effort so some of the federal grants
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
that we do receive require that the
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
state spend a certain level of General
 
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
funds towards that so if you have a
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
vacant position you're no you're no
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
longer going to spend General funds
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
towards a certain activity and you can't
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
apply that to your maintenance of effort
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
and that can come back to bite Us in
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
different ways as a state it may result
 
01:12:00.189 --> 01:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
in penalties if you don't meet a
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort it may result in
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
reduced federal funds for that year or
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
subsequent years and it's just important
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
that as we go through this when I if
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
there are questions or there or there
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
are requested actions those are just
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
some of the risks that I'm going to be
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
highlighting for this committee as we
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
move forward um we also we do have some
 
01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
programs where we have matching funds
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program and Henry Litman is
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
going to be here on Friday um with his
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
team talking about the Medicaid Program
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid we can for every you
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
know every dollar of General funds we
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
spend we get a $1 of federal but for the
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh the children's health insurance
 
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
program it's a
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
6535 um split for granted Advantage it's
 
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
9010 so there's there's different um
 
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
there's different Federal matching
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
levels depending on the
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
program and uh what you'll also see when
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
we start to dig in the budget into
 
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
specific class lines and accounting
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
units tomorrow we have I think at last
 
01:12:58.629 --> 01:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
about 226 different accounting units um
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
so there is a tremendous amount of
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
detail in there I'm going to go over a
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
couple of the high the highest generally
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
funded accounting units today um on the
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
right there that that you've seen this
 
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
before that is our sort of visual
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
demonstration to show you the interplay
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
of of how we budget versus what actually
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
happens and how we cost allocate those
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
dollars so if you turn to the next page
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
um what I've tried to do here is show
 
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
the committee where the governor's
 
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
budget stands as it compares to the
 
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
current bium and the summary file that
 
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the governor's operating
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
budget and and I um I can direct you to
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
that if you are so inclined if you have
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's operating budget in front
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
of you it is on page
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
um on page
 
01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
1,64 and and the comparisons that you
 
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
see in the governor's budget are the
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 2024 actual expense
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
the state fiscal year 2025 adjusted
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
authorized and then the governor's
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
recommended budget and the actual
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
expense doesn't show what the budget was
 
01:14:10.629 --> 01:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
it shows you this is what we actually
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
spent the adjusted authorized that shows
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
you any carry forward from the prior
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
year uh any new legislative activities
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
any fiscal acceptant expends those are
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
all showing up in that adjusted
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
authorized so sometimes the adjust that
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
authorized can actually be above what
 
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
the actual budget number is and so what
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
I've tried to laid out in front of you
 
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
here on slide seven is a comparison of
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
the operating budget there in the first
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
slide where you have House Bill one from
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
the current uh by name for
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
2425 with the 99.5 million and the just
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
over a billion dollars ear in 25 to the
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget that has
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
1.1 billion and 1.14 billion in state
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 26 and 27 now what wasn't
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
included in house bill one was all of
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
the hb2
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
Appropriations um which totaled U north
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
of $240 million and I'm trying to kind
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
of lay that out here and then another
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
consideration here and these are General
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
funds only by the way what what I've
 
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
also laid out here is the additional uh
 
01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
General general fund Appropriations that
 
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
came through legislation from State
 
01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:20.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 27 or excuse me State fiscal
 
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
year 25 so that when you're looking at
 
01:15:24.629 --> 01:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
at where we are currently in the
 
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
governor operating budget compared to
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
the effective or one way of looking at
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
the effective operating budget for 24
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
and 25 you will see a net reduction and
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
as we present for the various division
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
areas we're going to be going through
 
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
what are the reductions and what do
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
those represent um so that you have U an
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of uh of the current
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
budget that we are looking at so moving
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
on to to page eight um what I've done
 
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
here is I have identify the major some
 
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
of the major areas primarily by division
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
and what you see there that the bar
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
represents the total funds over the
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
entire banum and Medicaid there on the
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
far left you'll see is about 2.6 billion
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
doar of total funds the blue represents
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
the general fund portion um of of of
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
that budget uh for the
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
bium and uh again on Friday we're going
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
to go into the details on that that to
 
01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
understand okay in addition to the
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
general funding sources what are the
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
other funding sources and what does that
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
really mean the division for long-term
 
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
supports um and services the Bureau of
 
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
adult and aging um that that is the area
 
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
where we'll be talking about the county
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
cap so while there is $238 million of
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
General funds there there's also in this
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
bium I think around $267 $268 million of
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
money being contributed by the count
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
ities towards the CFI program and
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility uh payments for
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid eligible individuals the uh
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
dtss the developmental Services uh the
 
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
governor made reference to this I
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
believe in her um in her in her budget
 
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
address uh that's that's the number
 
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
relative to the billion dollars towards
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh DD Services over the course of the
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
banum um that's where you'll find those
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
numbers and in in those areas we have
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
matching funds uh primarily Medicaid
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
matching dollars that are available to
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
us that that's that's part of the reason
 
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
why you're seeing a much higher uh
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
Federal fund and other fund rate there
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
but when you move to the division for
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
children youth and families we do have
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
four e dollar available we do have some
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
tanif that we can use in certain
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances but um for the most part
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh that that function and that
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility falls to the state which
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
is why you're going to see a higher
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
general fund portion there um it's a
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
similar case in the division for
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health as well and the and
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
the division of economic stability uh
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office this is what
 
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to be covering tomorrow as
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
you see comparatively it's a relatively
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
small um piece of our budget but that's
 
01:18:13.229 --> 01:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
where some of the core critical services
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
and functions um are provided relative
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
to uh legal facilities HR Administration
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
Finance accounts payable AR um and those
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
things that you need to make things
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
happen on a day-to-day basis um Public
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
Health you'll see it's $49 million of
 
01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
General funds it's a relatively small
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
portion compared to the the federal
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
funds that we do receive that that is an
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
accounting area that um we have I think
 
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
close to if not above a 100 different
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
accounting units because we have so many
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
different small Federal awards that we
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
manage that come through that area and
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
then finally New Hampshire hospital and
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
Glencliff I combine those for for the
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
purposes here the the green you see
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
there um those are those are generally
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
speaking uh that is our other Revenue so
 
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
that's the revenue that we receive
 
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
through either um Medicaid Billings or
 
01:19:07.149 --> 01:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
third party insurance that we're able to
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
collect there to offset the operations
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
at the 247 facilities so again what I'm
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
trying to do here with this slide and
 
01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
then the upcoming slides is to give the
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
committee like a different perspective
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
because once you kind of dive down into
 
01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
the single accounting units I think it's
 
01:19:22.629 --> 01:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
easy to get lost there but but I'm
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
trying to provide a general overview in
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
cont context of sort of where the money
 
01:19:29.229 --> 01:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
is at and and how the how the services
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
that that we've been discussing over the
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
past two weeks sort of fit into larger
 
01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.149 align:start position:0%
past two weeks sort of fit into larger
budget

01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
scheme on the next page what I've done
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
here is I've put together the top 15
 
01:19:43.629 --> 01:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
generally funded accounts and on this
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
slide you you will see in 15 accounts of
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
HHS it it approximates about 77% of all
 
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
of the general funds and at the top
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
there the uh 7100 the DD Services
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
account uh represents a significant
 
01:20:01.629 --> 01:20:01.639 align:start position:0%
portion Medicaid that's our standard
 
01:20:03.629 --> 01:20:03.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid line the
 
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
7948 uh as well the waiver payments to
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
County participation um that that's
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's also a significant general fund
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
account State phas down is something
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
that we're going to talk about it's a
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
requirement that we pay the federal
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
government uh a portion of funds back
 
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
this started uh probably 20 years ago or
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
more um where for individuals that are
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid dual eligible we
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
actually have to make payments back to
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government uh in those cases
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
and uh Child and Family Services that's
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
a that's a large accounting line within
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
DCF uh that represents the residential
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
service costs that the state pays for uh
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
on a on a regular basis and uh this
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
committee did add some additional funds
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
to that line last time to meet to meet
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
the needs uh of the children there the C
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health program
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
support um and and it kind of goes down
 
01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
from there but the reason that I just
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of provide this
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
information to the committee in advance
 
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
of getting into the numbers is so that
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
to kind of trigger uh your questions so
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
if you do have questions please reach
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
out in advance of each of these specific
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
presentations um but again just trying
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
to tr trying to provide a different
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
insight into into some of the accounting
 
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
units that we do have next up on the
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
subsequent slide is Staffing
 
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
so overall um the Staffing was
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
relatively stagnant however there were a
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
few pieces of legislation from this past
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
session that did uh that did establish
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
new positions um you'll see those in
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
DCF and that was one of the major
 
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
changes that we did see one thing that
 
01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
that I would um certainly put out there
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
for the committee to consider um the
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital and resid treatment
 
01:21:57.629 --> 01:21:57.639 align:start position:0%
facility we have had some recent changes
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
here uh through the budget so some of
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
you probably saw that GNC several weeks
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
ago um approved and we recently closed
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
on uh a an agreement with Dartmouth
 
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
where they will take over leasing uh the
 
01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
facility and they will be running the
 
01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
operations of the hospital uh we were
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
previously looking at a little over $4
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
million of General funds necessary for
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
the B for the state to continue um to
 
01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
continue operating that now what we'll
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
actually see in this bium is we'll see a
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
net positive impact Dartmouth will be
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
paying the state um in in slightly less
 
01:22:39.149 --> 01:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
than $1.3 million each year for lease
 
01:22:41.709 --> 01:22:41.719 align:start position:0%
revenue and there is a subsequent there
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
is a bill that uh and I don't recall the
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
number off the top of my head there is a
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill currently that would establish a
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund to receive that revenue
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
and the reason that that that bill is
 
01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
going forward is because the agreement
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
that the State signed with Dartmouth it
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
requires that the state pay up to $3
 
01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
million in capital uh in in matching
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
Capital funds so if Dartmouth spends a
 
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
dollar then we have to spend a dollar
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
the advantage there is that Dartmouth
 
01:23:15.149 --> 01:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
will be investing Capital dollars into
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
the state-owned facility but we just
 
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
need to match over the next 7 years up
 
01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
to $3 million so I can certainly get the
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
committee the number for that
 
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.629 align:start position:0%
committee the number for that
legislation

01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:25.639 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
it's uhb sb18 um
 
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
yes I think we have a question
 
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
representative wner yes thank
 
01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.990 align:start position:0%
representative wner yes thank
you

01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
so I looked at the Hamstead page in the
 
01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:43.639 align:start position:0%
budget and I noticed that you know you
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
dropped down to zero yes but we will be
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
purchasing services from Dartmouth for
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
those children that are Medicaid
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
eligible is that correct
 
01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:59.629 align:start position:0%
eligible is that correct
purchasing

01:23:59.629 --> 01:23:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
service wait c c can can you clarify are
 
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
are are you thinking that we will be
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
paying Dartmouth directly or through the
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid budget through the Medicaid
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
budget yes yes yes through the Medicaid
 
01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
budget yes if they chip or standard
 
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid eligible so though that we
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
don't have an expense any longer in
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital I mean we are still we
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
are still liable to pay for the Services
 
01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
provided those children so it will come
 
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
through the Medicaid budget when we get
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
to the Medicaid budget will you be sure
 
01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
to point that out because that would be
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
an increase in the budget for Medicaid
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
correct um no I I don't think so because
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
those individuals would would have
 
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
already been within the Medicaid budget
 
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
we were still claiming I mean we'd still
 
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
be getting Medicaid dollars for those
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
individuals the reductions that we saw
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
in the Hamstead budget um it was
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
primarily related to the operational
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
cost so it went through a couple
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
iterations where initially we had a
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
contractor providing all the clinical
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
and direct care and then we moved into
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
state employees for a period of time um
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
and and those were many of the primary
 
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
drivers of those costs but I can talk to
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
Henry in advance of that to see if we
 
01:25:16.590 --> 01:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
can isolate something for you there yeah
 
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
I mean the model has changed so
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
previously um Hamstead hospital had a
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
finance office that was essentially
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
getting reim reimbursed reimbursement
 
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
through Medicaid as well as other
 
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
sources other uh payers insurers
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
Commercial Insurance
 
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
Etc um but so that that shouldn't given
 
01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
the commitment to the underserved and to
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
low-income kids and families that are
 
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
required under the lease and the joint
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
operating committee we don't we expect
 
01:25:48.669 --> 01:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
the number of um youth uh on Medicaid to
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
to stay the same or increase and so now
 
01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:53.719 align:start position:0%
it's Dartmouth that is financially
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
carrying the responsibility for
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and risk so I don't I
 
01:25:59.229 --> 01:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
don't see it changing if anything uh it
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
might even go down given some of the
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
generosity of those benefits as a state
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
hospital but um but your point is well
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
takeen okay
 
01:26:12.109 --> 01:26:12.119 align:start position:0%
thank represented stream um just quick
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
follow up on that does that mean then
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
where we would see the change by uh
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
having Hamstead not part of um our
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
budget here is that the revenues
 
01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere will be decreased since we're
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
not collect
 
01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
true Hamstead we're not collecting from
 
01:26:29.109 --> 01:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
managed care and so
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
on yes so so Hamstead was collecting
 
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
revenues um they were relatively small
 
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
amount I think for this year last I had
 
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
checked it was about $6 million but when
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
we were looking at operating costs north
 
01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
of $20
 
01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
million um it there were certainly
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
challenges relative to the sort of
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
long-term viability and so when we were
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the you know the what is the
 
01:26:55.149 --> 01:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
net benefit as far as General funds Go I
 
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
mean we were really honing in on what
 
01:26:58.350 --> 01:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
what are the general funds that would be
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
needed to continue operating there and
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
they were looking to be over $40 million
 
01:27:03.109 --> 01:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:27:03.119 --> 01:27:07.030 align:start position:0%
for the
bium

01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I we we got to Staffing right the
 
01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
that page I don't see a page number on
 
01:27:13.639 --> 01:27:15.030 align:start position:0%
that page I don't see a page number on
it

01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
but it looks like the agency request for
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
Staffing went up by 12 from the the
 
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
governor's budget so the agency requests
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
this represents the positions that were
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
included in the efficiency budget um we
 
01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
had a number of prioritized needs
 
01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
requests to address the the legislation
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
that passed in state fiscal year 20 uh
 
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
24 and the reason that we had
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs requests for those
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
positions is because initially when we
 
01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:49.639 align:start position:0%
put the go put the budget together
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
together the instructions were to not
 
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
have any new positions so we had to set
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
those positions aside that were
 
01:27:59.109 --> 01:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
established via the 24 legislation and
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
put those in as prioritized needs so the
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
agency request again is the efficiency
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
budget um s SP 417 s SP
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
463 uh I think it was
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
1573 if I remember correctly I may not
 
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
um all all basically either established
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
SP 463 as well um either establish new
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
positions via legislation or would
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
require new position to implement and so
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
only a portion of what we had requested
 
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
was added to the governor's
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
budget all right well well thank you for
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
that I um I I do specifically want to
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
look at that list um and I'm I'm
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
particularly curious about the
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
DCF prioritized needs I I I I was
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
involved in uh a significant DCF Bill
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
looking at out of state uh inspections
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
all last year and I lost track of what
 
01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
happened to it at the end of the term so
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
so I I would like to see where we ended
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
up um and then I
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
thought that the governor's request was
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
um based on giving you a number of 400
 
01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
they looked at 450 vacancies and said
 
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
you could fill 400 and or excuse me 50
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
of and they held back 400 where where do
 
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
I see that number yep so um we had 394
 
01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
positions that were unfunded during the
 
01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
governor's phase those positions were
 
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
unfunded across dozens of different
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
accounting units um so you're not going
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
to see those show up in one individual
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
spot one thing that I was doing before I
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
came here Was preparing for tomorrow so
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
that as we go through different
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
accounting units I can say there's three
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
unfunded here there's three unfunded
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
here um to try to give you that
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
information we're also working and and
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
this is part of the challenge of of only
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
having about a business day or so we're
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
also working on um finalizing a
 
01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
crosswalk so that as we go through the
 
01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
budget you will see certain accounting
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
units have positions increase and
 
01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
certain accounting units decrease we're
 
01:30:15.629 --> 01:30:15.639 align:start position:0%
working on a crosswalk that we can
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
provide to you to address all those
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
questions because there are a lot of
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
different moving pieces that we have had
 
01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
over the the current bium just to
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
address operating business needs so I
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
I'll get that prepped for you as well so
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
so the at the end result this staffing
 
01:30:37.629 --> 01:30:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.639 --> 01:30:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
change

01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
so it's subject to change if the house
 
01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
make changes what the governor's budget
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
did not do was it did not abolish
 
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
positions it unfunded the positions so
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
the positions still exist but what
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
you'll see show up in in the governor's
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
operating budget is you won't see that
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
full-time authorized or unclassified
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
line increase in numerically but you
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
will see a decrease in the class 10 the
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
salary or the class 12 the salary for
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions and the class 60
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
benefits you will see the decrease there
 
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
that's where the savings will be
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
generated okay so the first time second
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
time we run into that example i' I'd
 
01:31:23.229 --> 01:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate a a a going over it in detail
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
so I know how to interpret the future
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
lines of course all right thank
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
representative tki I just want a
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
clarification on the um Staffing at
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
Hamstead so the 27 that are there are
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
you saying that that's going to zero out
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
or is that 27 remaining that the state
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
has so this this is probably an issue
 
01:31:44.189 --> 01:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
that we'll we'll want to discuss um
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
because the because those positions
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
unfunded what we have done uh prior to
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
what we were doing prior to the close
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
was were working with um the individuals
 
01:31:58.109 --> 01:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
that were there some many of them were
 
01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
offered jobs with Dartmouth many of them
 
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
took those and then we transfer the
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
other individuals to other places within
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
the department um but what what I
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
suspect this committee would look to do
 
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
is to reduce that full-time authorized
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
count of 27 and so we would just want to
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
work with you to make sure that if we
 
01:32:18.669 --> 01:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
are going to go down that route we
 
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
abolish positions that are vacant and
 
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
not positions that have someone in them
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
today and filled
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um all right any other
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
other questions do you want to continue
 
01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely um if you turn to the next
 
01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
page slide 11 and I apologize I I think
 
01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
what happened maybe why one of the
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
number why the numbers were written over
 
01:32:41.109 --> 01:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
was because I probably pasted an image
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
over that so that's my fault and my uh
 
01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.830 align:start position:0%
over that so that's my fault and my uh
PowerPoint

01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
deficiencies um but on page 11 uh what
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
I've done here is I've pulled a couple
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
reports from the governor's uh budget
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I've looked at the the class 10 the
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
salary line for uh full-time authorized
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
positions the class 12 which is the
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
salary line for unclassified positions
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
class class 50 which is part-time
 
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
positions and class 59 which is
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
part-time temporary positions as well as
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
the uh salary and benefits to to um
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrate sort of what portion of our
 
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
budget is represented by Personnel what
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see there is slightly less than
 
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
11% is currently Personnel we and I'm
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
still working on the final numbers but
 
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
basically by unfund the 394 it's it's
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
effectively around 2526 million of a
 
01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
general fund reduction over the banum um
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
to our Personnel
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
costs is is it is it the case though
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the use of contracts basically uh
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
is another way to effectively augment
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
Personnel so at Glen Cliffe and New
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital we do use contracted
 
01:34:00.189 --> 01:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
agency staff to fill uh staffing needs
 
01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
when we have them what we generally find
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
though is contracted staff are
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
significantly more expensive uh for the
 
01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
operations of a 247 facility um so we we
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
try to maximize and retain staff
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
internally um in the state positions
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
because we're going to probably end up
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
paying a lot more if we're going to be
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
contracting that out yes sir I see all
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
of that I'm I'm just trying to
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
understand this ISS Personnel costs and
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
you just listed the the four categories
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
of permanent full and and so so we're
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
also having Personnel costs that are out
 
01:34:39.109 --> 01:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
in the contract world that are not on
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
this slide correct I apologize I I
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
misunderstood yes in addition to this we
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
also have contracted staff in class 102
 
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
103 and that should be it okay and and
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
then do we have an overview of that um
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
the the Personnel costs associated with
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
contracted Services is
 
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
there so um when we were when we are
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
going to talk about the um the YDC
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
budget and the New Hampshire hospital
 
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
budget and the Glen Cliff home budget I
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
was planning on addressing that at that
 
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
point if that works for the committee
 
01:35:15.629 --> 01:35:15.639 align:start position:0%
that that's probably 80% of our
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
contracted uh Personnel but but it
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't include things like it or public
 
01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
health or so there would still be some
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
Miss components are those other
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
components not significant in your view
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
um I I think when um when when Ernie uh
 
01:35:33.629 --> 01:35:33.639 align:start position:0%
Jillian and and Dave weers come to
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
present on the Bureau of Information
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
Services budget tomorrow we're going to
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about that because
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
that that is a critical service that um
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
our Information Services team utilizes
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
right all right so again I'm just trying
 
01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand what's in the
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
slides what and what's not in the slide
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
and what's not in the slide are the
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel costs that are carried by
 
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
contract correct all
 
01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.950 align:start position:0%
contract correct all
right

01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay so on the next page again this is
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
this is a quick overview of what what is
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
to come in the coming days and weeks um
 
01:36:11.709 --> 01:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry I I've been meaning to ask
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
you this and and it's going to slip my
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
mind again if I don't and and since we
 
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
have contracted personnel and uh the
 
01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
governor essentially imposed um I I
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
think a a a salary freeze for the this
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
budget I believe that's part of this W
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
was there a similar salary freeze for
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
contracted service support like the the
 
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
the project managers for it and the
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists or U UNH did we do did
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
the contractors pay pay the same freeze
 
01:36:49.709 --> 01:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
prices our
 
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
employees so uh the governor via an
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
executive order implemented a hiring
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
freeze so right now um well we we we do
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
have the authority to move forward with
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
hiring Direct Care positions um we do
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
need to receive approval from the
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
governor's office for posting any other
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
positions so that's sort of how it
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
effectively hits us today I use freeze
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
wrong I'm I'm sorry you're answering a
 
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
good question but it's not the one I
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
asked and it's my fault uh what I'm what
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
I believe is in this budget is no coal
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
for employees we didn't we didn't
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
increase the the the the hourly pay
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
correct okay so so that that's embedded
 
01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
in the Personnel cost you're going to
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
show us in the budget so my question is
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
did we do something similar with
 
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
contracted Personnel did or did the
 
01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
contracted Personnel uh end up getting
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
colas because they have contract writers
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
and Provisions where the let's say you
 
01:37:56.189 --> 01:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
take an it consultant at $120 an hour
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
are they going to be getting $150 an
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
hour or did we uh do anything to freeze
 
01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
those that pay so there there was not
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
anything uh globally done relative to
 
01:38:13.589 --> 01:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
contractor pay I think what what is sort
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
of a unique issue when you're budgeting
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
you may have a contract over here that
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
is good for you've agreed to the terms
 
01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:25.159 align:start position:0%
for 1 2 3 4 5 years potentially um some
 
01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
of the contracted staff that we do use
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
um they're Statewide contracts that are
 
01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
administered by the Department
 
01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
administrative services and we go for
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
through a request for qualifications
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
process to kind of add on to those or
 
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
tack onto those to be able to take
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
advantage um of the Statewide uh
 
01:38:42.159 --> 01:38:43.750 align:start position:0%
advantage um of the Statewide uh
resources

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
but in in dhs's budget there was not a
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive reduction to the rates or
 
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature that we are
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
paying our contractors no okay so just
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
so so you know where I'm going with my
 
01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
concern on that is employees will will
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
be rightly bothered if they don't get
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
colas uh or colas that keep up with
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
inflation or whatever we do with the
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
colas meanwhile it it feels like because
 
01:39:13.870 --> 01:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
of the length of these other contracts
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
that uh there may be payroll or salary
 
01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
increases that contractors are getting
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
that our own employees don't and I just
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
I I just want to be able to understand
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
what what we're doing and what the
 
01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
magnitude of of all of that is so that
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
when we get the questions I'm able to
 
01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
answer them um and I I you probably
 
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
haven't done uh because you've had so
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
much to do but you probably haven't done
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
an analysis of all the contracts for
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
which we pay effectively for contract
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
service support um that have salary
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
increases is embedded in them and you
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what the cumulative effect of
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
those salary increases are against all
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
900 of your contracts that's my guess
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
yeah and and we
 
01:40:07.070 --> 01:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
also every contract looks a little
 
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
different if you've seen one you've seen
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
one contract because some of our
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
contracts are rate based some are
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
deliverable based some are cost
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement but they may have indirect
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
costs in there and you can't necessarily
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
get insight into I mean you have Insight
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
but you know there's limitations on what
 
01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
that pays for for um and gen and often
 
01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
times what we do what we do see is when
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
we do budget we Flatline many of those
 
01:40:34.109 --> 01:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
contracts year over-ear and you I mean
 
01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
ask the provider community that that we
 
01:40:37.629 --> 01:40:37.639 align:start position:0%
talked to I mean that's one of the
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
challenges that they have is that they
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't consistently see those increases
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
and so um I mean in our prioritized need
 
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
we did include a number of um rate
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
increases that we're going to be
 
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:51.639 align:start position:0%
touching on as we move forward uh and
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
and most of those at least the initial
 
01:40:55.589 --> 01:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
phase there was not sufficient funds to
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
cover those but I I think it's a um I
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
will keep that in mind representative
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
Edwards as we prepare our budgets and
 
01:41:05.070 --> 01:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
try to highlight that uh as as we go
 
01:41:06.669 --> 01:41:06.679 align:start position:0%
into each of those class lines get into
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
the detail to try to address that
 
01:41:11.550 --> 01:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
question for you okay um and I know
 
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of extra work that I don't
 
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
think I've seen in the previous two
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
budgets and so I respect the the the
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
workload associated with that I I do um
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
and if nothing else I'd like to
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
understand the magnitude of the issue
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
and um and I'd like you to think about
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
if there's any way that we can go to our
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
contractors and ask them uh essentially
 
01:41:36.239 --> 01:41:37.310 align:start position:0%
contractors and ask them uh essentially
to

01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
voluntarily uh amend their contracts to
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
salaries it's crazy I know but that's
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to be able to talk about that
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
you okay okay so um as I was saying on
 
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
on slide 12 uh we this is a sort of a
 
01:42:03.149 --> 01:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
quick preview of uh Coming Attractions

Cliff

01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
Cliff
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
home now this this is great I got I got
 
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
a couple loose items though okay one of
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
them is is attached to the department
 
01:43:06.510 --> 01:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
when when will we get the presentation
 
01:43:08.669 --> 01:43:08.679 align:start position:0%
on the prescription drug affordability
 
01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
board that is something that I saw this
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
morning and need to address so that that
 
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be scheduled okay now C because
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's awkward this is the first formal
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
budget year that you guys are that you
 
01:43:23.229 --> 01:43:23.239 align:start position:0%
have them attached to you I think for
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
the full thing are do you do you think
 
01:43:28.270 --> 01:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
we should be working with them directly
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
or or should they come under the DHHS
 
01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
and brella so they are admin so uh just
 
01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:35.719 align:start position:0%
for awareness for all members of the
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
committee of the prescription drug
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
affordability board is administratively
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
attached to the department we have an
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
active mou with them where we provide
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
services and they uh reimburse us for
 
01:43:47.229 --> 01:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
those Services related to HR
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
Administration legal and otherwise um I
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
think it would probably be best to have
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
them lead the discussion and then I can
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
join them for support more on the
 
01:43:59.070 --> 01:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
technical end because we do provide that
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis I think that would
 
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
work the best but for a coordination POS
 
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
point of view you the the department
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
should be involved yes please yes okay
 
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
so then the second one and I know this
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
is not yours this is more for Mr Ripple
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh what when when when are we going to
 
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
include the Veterans
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
Home the veterans home I believe is on
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
either the 11th whatever the last day is
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
that I've scheduled
 
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
presentations um okay yeah that's where
 
01:44:32.109 --> 01:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
the nhhs and the Glen Cliff is yes yep
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
so the veterans home will be that
 
01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:38.360 align:start position:0%

01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
Mr White you can oh wait a second Mr
 
01:44:42.589 --> 01:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
string or representative Stringham just
 
01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
along those lines when when would the uh
 
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
DD budget be presented is that part of
 
01:44:49.229 --> 01:44:49.239 align:start position:0%

01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
services yes yeah on on the 10th and uh
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead okay so um I I what I
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to do here today we do have the
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
the draft of the house bill to that was
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
released on Friday if if you'd like to
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
go over it and I can highlight the HHS
 
01:45:17.709 --> 01:45:17.719 align:start position:0%
Provisions if if that would work Mr
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
chair uh let let me I I looked at these
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
over the weekend um and I I think I
 
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
think some of them are just kind of um
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
redundant with previous years um and but
 
01:45:37.709 --> 01:45:37.719 align:start position:0%
even some of the Redundant ones are
 
01:45:41.709 --> 01:45:41.719 align:start position:0%
significant um yep so I I I don't know I
 
01:45:43.589 --> 01:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know a better way to do
 
01:45:47.149 --> 01:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
it uh Mr White than to just I I can run
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
through them really quick and we can
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
talk about ones we want to have further
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
discussion I can get answers for
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
followup questions if Works let's start
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
okay yeah representative tki I just have
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
a quick question I don't know if this is
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
from probably from Mr rippel do we think
 
01:46:04.589 --> 01:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
that this document is pretty well solid
 
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
will the draft we get whenever first
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
two-part question one um when would we
 
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
expect to get the official draft and two
 
01:46:13.629 --> 01:46:13.639 align:start position:0%
is there a chance there could be
 
01:46:13.639 --> 01:46:14.709 align:start position:0%
is there a chance there could be
additional

01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
items I think you could probably expect
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
to get it uh in about a week that's a
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
pretty typical time frame from when it's
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh been handed over from the governor's
 
01:46:25.390 --> 01:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
office to OS I'm not sure if there will
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
be additional sections I've heard
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
anecdotally uh that there may be but I
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
can't I can neither confirm nor deny
 
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
that okay that helps thanks okay go go
 
01:46:39.310 --> 01:46:39.320 align:start position:0%
ahead excellent so if you turn to page
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh 47 of 77 I just want to make sure
 
01:46:42.239 --> 01:46:43.390 align:start position:0%
uh 47 of 77 I just want to make sure
everybody's

01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
there and there there aren't numbers
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
here so I'll do my best to kind of
 
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
narrate us through this um to start
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
there the Department of Health and Human
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
Services State grant and aid
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
what this provision does is this
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
appropriates $5 million each year of the
 
01:47:01.470 --> 01:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
bium towards the state grant and aid
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
program and and that is a program that
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
is used for uh emergency shelter
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
Services there's uh I don't know off top
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
of my head I think around 1317 contracts
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
that the depart maybe more that the
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
department has with shelters around the
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
state historically this has been paid
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
for with 100% General funds uh however
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh individuals that are in the shelter
 
01:47:26.510 --> 01:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
often have are either at risk of or may
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
have an opioid use disorder and this
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
provision directs those funds from the
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement trust fund towards this
 
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
purpose the next um can I ask a question
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
that go ahead um am I correct that the
 
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
the being able to spend the opioid
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
abatement trust fund money usually comes
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
from that committee or commission that
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
manages that and does the Governor have
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
the authority to spend it here in hb2 so
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
typically yes that that is where um
 
01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
those funds are directed to I think
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
because you have the notwithstanding any
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
other law to the contrary that would
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
temporarily suspend that and allow for
 
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
the distribution of those funds from
 
01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
that account thank you of course so I
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
have a question for representative
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
walner um with the way way cross I think
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's Sur name um Waypoint Waypoint
 
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
Waypoint uh do in their in their
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
resident programs or or their other
 
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
programs are they also dealing with uh
 
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
opioid issues or they dealing with uh
 
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
sober um
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
residents because because I'm I'm
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if we're looking for money for
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
Waypoint right so I'm just wondering if
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
if this $10 million a year is maybe part
 
01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
of the solution for Waypoint and
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
I think I would want to confer with uh
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
Waypoint about that but I will do that
 
01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
and let you know like I said I'm I'm
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
trying to find money and here's
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
ma'am do you anticipate that any of this
 
01:49:14.430 --> 01:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh funding would go to
 
01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.149 align:start position:0%
uh funding would go to
Waypoint

01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
Waypoint
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm no no um the these are the
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
state Granton Aid contracts and way
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
point uh the you shelter is not part of
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
that uh however the uh the governor's
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
budget did include $500,000 of General
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
funds each year for the Waypoint use
 
01:49:37.629 --> 01:49:37.639 align:start position:0%
shelter contract that's an accounting
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
102 this is actually news so so I've
 
01:49:50.589 --> 01:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
seen hb2 or not hb2 I've seen a bill 519
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
that has talked about the 500,000
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
but it's been my impression that that
 
01:49:58.589 --> 01:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
500,000 was not in the governor's budget
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
and I think you just said it is I just
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
need to know where it is yes in in 3170
 
01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:10.750 align:start position:0%
need to know where it is yes in in 3170
class

01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
102 okay well that's that's good news
 
01:50:18.510 --> 01:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
right did you know that no looking
 
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
for I think I just learned that okay all
 
01:50:24.629 --> 01:50:24.639 align:start position:0%
right question um uh question represent
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
Stringham yeah can we have an accounting
 
01:50:29.550 --> 01:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
of the um of the opioid fund as part of
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
the process the current balance yeah the
 
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
opio abatement trust fund sure along
 
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
with any uh other restrictions other
 
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
than how you uh approve it out as part
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
of this thank you yep
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay the next item next hp2 item at the
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
top of page 48 um this is the
 
01:50:53.229 --> 01:50:53.239 align:start position:0%
perspective repeal regarding the
 
01:50:54.990 --> 01:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
exemption from certain transfer
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
procedures extended so back in
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
2018 there was a provision of law that
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
was put into place with a delayed
 
01:51:08.069 --> 01:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
effective uh date and what that would do
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
is it would take away the Department's
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
ability to move funds out of personnel
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
class lines um this is something that
 
01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
the department regularly does to manage
 
01:51:20.189 --> 01:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
um either the New Hampshire hospital 247
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
facilities the example we talked about
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
earlier was to in contracted staff lines
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
um to meet emerging emerging needs this
 
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
has been in place for a number of Bia
 
01:51:33.390 --> 01:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
now um to to your point earlier as far
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
as being boiler Pate language an
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
alternative would certainly be to strike
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
the initial chapter law um but what we
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
had included in the agency budget was
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
recommending postponing it the next item
 
01:51:46.990 --> 01:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
there the perspective repeal regarding
 
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility so so I have a question it's
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
probably the same question for both of
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
these um I I thought I I'm having a
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
flashback to last budget cycle and and I
 
01:52:01.069 --> 01:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
thought what I what I what we wanted to
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
do last time was to take these regularly
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
recurring hb2 items and put them into a
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
place in the law to where we didn't have
 
01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
to mess with them anymore and if we ever
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
changed our mind we could just change
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
that law instead of having to keep doing
 
01:52:22.069 --> 01:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
hb2 does that sound familiar and and
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
what happened to that idea yes so we did
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
you we you um you did that with a couple
 
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
of items one of those items that is very
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
similar to this was the authority to
 
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
fill unfunded positions so that was
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
moved into permanent RSA I think it's
 
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
126a um and so that has been codified in
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
statute and so you won't see that one
 
01:52:48.069 --> 01:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
here this particular item was was not uh
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
was not resolved in the same manner it
 
01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
was just
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
postponed okay this one and I'm guessing
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
the next one are they good candidates
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
for doing something
 
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
similar um given the history uh they
 
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
certainly could
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
be all right so um I think the new
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
people certainly need to hear the
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
details of what those are sure um so the
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
the next item the perspective repeal
 
01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
regarding eligibility for services
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
extended um this comes from House Bill
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
191 laws of
 
01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:23.719 align:start position:0%
2011 uh basically this has been extended
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
the effective date has been extended
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again because
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
what this would cause is it would cause
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
increase expenses at the community
 
01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
mental health centers where they would
 
01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
be required to provide services under
 
01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
all conditions I think it's a little bit
 
01:53:40.069 --> 01:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
more complicated than that and I'd like
 
01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
ctio Fox to speak to this a little bit
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
about a little bit about this and the
 
01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:45.800 align:start position:0%
history when we do the division for
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health budget but this has
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
been delayed for over a decade now The
 
01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
Graduate Medical medical education
 
01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
payments uh has been suspended also I
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
think this might be the third by Ania um
 
01:54:01.229 --> 01:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
where it may potentially be suspended
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
again this is the program out of the
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um division this would require
 
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
additional General funds if it were to
 
01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:08.149 align:start position:0%
additional General funds if it were to
be

01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
funded uh similarly the the just below
 
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
that there the suspension of
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid payments to hospitals
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
this is another provision that has been
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
suspended for another Bania same deal
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
where we would need additional General
 
01:54:24.030 --> 01:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
funds to support that program If This
 
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
Were uh not suspended the next item
 
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
there this is the Medicaid to schools
 
01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
program uh fiscal committee approval
 
01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:32.470 align:start position:0%
program uh fiscal committee approval
supplemental

01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
supplemental
 
01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
funding the fiscal excuse me the
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools program is a program
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
where the state share match the cost is
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
actually incurred by the the Lea the
 
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
local education um organization there
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
and the federal funds are budgeted
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
Within hhs's budget so it's it's cost
 
01:54:56.669 --> 01:54:56.679 align:start position:0%
neutral to the state proper but it just
 
01:54:59.310 --> 01:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be accounted for and the reason
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
that this exists is in the event um
 
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
local expenses exceed what we projected
 
01:55:08.109 --> 01:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
it basically allows the department to
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
not go back through fiscal to accept the
 
01:55:13.069 --> 01:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds into our budget
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
to meet that need in the event that
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
happens it has not happened uh yet um
 
01:55:20.189 --> 01:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
but this this language was in the
 
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
current uh hb2
 
01:55:27.589 --> 01:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
so so is this Medicaid to school item
 
01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
um this this isn't going to show up in
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
hb1 it's this hb2 is the
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
entire no so so there there is a class
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
line within there is an accounting unit
 
01:55:43.149 --> 01:55:43.159 align:start position:0%
within the okay yeah it's right there
 
01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so so that's where the money
 
01:55:48.069 --> 01:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
will go how much is that
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
in the Medicaid to schools accounting
 
01:56:01.629 --> 01:56:01.639 align:start position:0%
unit 7207 there's approximately $17
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
million of federal funds that are
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
budgeted today and that's all federal no
 
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
General it's 100% federal
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
funds okay and why why is it important
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
to bypass the fiscal committee that's
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's typically not done it's been done
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
with this program before but why why did
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
we make an exemption exception to having
 
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
this program bypass fiscal committee if
 
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
additional fed federal funds were made
 
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
available I I don't know the originating
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
history behind it uh I think one issue
 
01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:37.669 align:start position:0%
history behind it uh I think one issue
is

01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
that we have not been able to
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily project what the local um
 
01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
educational units are going to incur
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
relative to their costs or what the
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
participation is going to be that makes
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
projecting it very difficult
 
01:56:56.350 --> 01:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
I I think one one thing to consider is
 
01:56:59.790 --> 01:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
generally speaking if if cost did if
 
01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
they did start to increase rapidly at a
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
certain point of time the turnaround
 
01:57:06.589 --> 01:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
time on fiscal committee and GNC
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
approval is about 6 weeks so if we get
 
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
to a point where we either failed to
 
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
project some change in expense we may
 
01:57:16.270 --> 01:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
not have those funds immediately
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
available or wouldn't have the authority
 
01:57:20.990 --> 01:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
immediately available um to to capture
 
01:57:22.910 --> 01:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
those federal dollars so
 
01:57:24.669 --> 01:57:24.679 align:start position:0%
I think it was in consideration of just
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
the process because we not only have to
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
go through fiscal we also have to go
 
01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
through through GNC which is sometimes a
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
week and a half later right so so this
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
is one of those programs where I find
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
myself having to uh rationalize and
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
justify it to people that are friendly
 
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
with me and and I'm just uh I'll just
 
01:57:44.669 --> 01:57:44.679 align:start position:0%
leave it for the committee that we we
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
may want to talk about uh requiring any
 
01:57:50.109 --> 01:57:50.119 align:start position:0%
additional funds should there be any to
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
go through the fiscal committee which is
 
01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
is a fairly standard thing and which may
 
01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
give the house and the Senate more
 
01:57:59.830 --> 01:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
visibility into the growth of this
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
program and the progress of the program
 
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
it it it seems to be a program of public
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
interest so so um so let's you'll help
 
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
me keep a note on that so that we can
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
come back and talk about that more all
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
right do you have any thoughts on that
 
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
okay all right I have a quick comment
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead didn't we discuss this a
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
little bit when we were talking about
 
01:58:28.830 --> 01:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
the services that are provided and we
 
01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
were talking about physical therapy and
 
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
OT and yeah because we already did talk
 
01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
about that that these are required by
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
federal law to be provided to students
 
01:58:41.709 --> 01:58:41.719 align:start position:0%
yes well not to all students to special
 
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
education students I I I understand that
 
01:58:46.069 --> 01:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
all the students that receive care under
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
here are um on IEPs and the IEPs lay out
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
what kind of services are to be provided
 
01:58:56.350 --> 01:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
and then once that's done then it's up
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
to the program to deliver them is that
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
are we saying am I saying the same thing
 
01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
as she is um I I I I think ju just kind
 
01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
of going back to the language like the
 
01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:09.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this is to essentially
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that there are no delays in those
 
01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
payments for the services that are
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
provided that that that was a true
 
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
impetus behind behind this particular
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
provision so um if an individual does
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
qualify and the Medicaid services or the
 
01:59:25.149 --> 01:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
services qualified for Medicaid and they
 
01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
are delivered the um the local school
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
district they have to incur those costs
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
and we were just trying to make sure
 
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
that if they incur those costs the
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
federal matching dollars are immediately
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
available right so so if I if the
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee did get it in its head to
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
require it going to fiscal committee the
 
01:59:45.629 --> 01:59:45.639 align:start position:0%
cleanest way to do that would just be to
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
eliminate this hb2
 
01:59:50.430 --> 01:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
item uh yes if you eliminate this hb2
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
item we would need to go through fiscal
 
01:59:54.189 --> 01:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
engine PNC all right that future
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you I wonder if it
 
01:59:57.629 --> 01:59:57.639 align:start position:0%
might be helpful we can have director
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
Henry Litman on Friday speak to any
 
02:00:02.910 --> 02:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
consequences of that it's a political
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
thing I I no I mean it's just how much
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
visibility does does the public want and
 
02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
if there is growth in this particular
 
02:00:13.229 --> 02:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
program and like I said it's it's been a
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
from my perspective it's been a program
 
02:00:17.229 --> 02:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people have a tremendous
 
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
amount of anxiety about the ones that do
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know have anxiety have lot lot of
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
anxiety so I just I'm thinking through
 
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
the transparency part of it I I see the
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
the value and speed to funding I see
 
02:00:35.229 --> 02:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
that benefit but there's a
 
02:00:38.669 --> 02:00:38.679 align:start position:0%
tradeoff all right
 
02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
sir from the standpoint of division two
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
looking into the education uh special ed
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
so if if a student has uh several
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
dollars spent on Medicaid to
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
schools and they include that in the
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
three and a half times when they start
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
to go to the catastrophic
 
02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
Aid half of the money could be from this
 
02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
but we won't know so it's not quite the
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
same thing as when we tell the school
 
02:01:14.910 --> 02:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
districts you have to spend three and a
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
half times x before you can start asking
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
for help on special ed and they could be
 
02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
crediting millions of dollars a came
 
02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
from Medicaid to schools to say yes we
 
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
spent the money already so and every
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
time I ask for an accounting of how much
 
02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
was in this 2 and a half 3 and a2x was
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
really Medicaid to school oh we can't
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
Hipp so it's it's difficult for us in
 
02:01:43.709 --> 02:01:43.719 align:start position:0%
division two when we're trying to work
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
with how much money do we have to put in
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
do you have a comment Mr White I I don't
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
know if the extent to which you have
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
visibility into the issue you're
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
carrying in division two which I I
 
02:02:03.069 --> 02:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
generally stay away from so not so much
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
best to keep my mouth shut yeah all
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
right uh okay so so go ahead now now I
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
think you're ready for uh DHS Division
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid services excellent
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
um so uh moving on to the appropriation
 
02:02:24.910 --> 02:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
Wick Farmers Market nutrition program no
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
no you're skipping one on page
 
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
49 aren't we
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
still oh okay yes I apologize yep thank
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
you uh so this provision here this this
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
has been in uh hb2 for a couple of years
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
now what this allows uh the Medicaid
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
Program to do and and I know Henry wants
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
to speak to this this on Friday is this
 
02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of the bium it allows the
 
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program to carry those funds
 
02:02:55.470 --> 02:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
forward into the next year this has been
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
done in in Prior Bania because uh a
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is a fairly volatile uh program
 
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
it is difficult to predict while we do
 
02:03:07.069 --> 02:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
work with our actuaries actuaries are
 
02:03:09.310 --> 02:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
you know we're basing our estimates uh
 
02:03:12.069 --> 02:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
on the best information available um
 
02:03:13.709 --> 02:03:13.719 align:start position:0%
this all this would allow us to carry
 
02:03:15.790 --> 02:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
forward the funds at the end of the bium
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
into the next bium to fund the Medicaid
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
Program which would effectively reduce
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of General funds that would
 
02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
be needed um in the next bium because
 
02:03:26.990 --> 02:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
we'd be carrying any unspent funds
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
forward so would this be a decent
 
02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
candidate for consideration of just
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
moving into uh RSA instead of repeating
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
it in hb2 my understanding is there are
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
certain states that have Provisions like
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
this in state law um but New Hampshire
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge has never had something
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
like this there but I think it's
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
certainly worth a conversation and I I
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
know Henry um and I definitely would
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
like to talk about it when we talk about
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program to just to give the
 
02:03:56.910 --> 02:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee better understanding of of how
 
02:03:58.270 --> 02:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
it works thank
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
you the next item is the wick Farmers
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
Market nutrition program so in hb2 of
 
02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
the current bium there was an
 
02:04:06.990 --> 02:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation made in the amount of
 
02:04:09.629 --> 02:04:09.639 align:start position:0%
$600,000 for the wick Farmers Market
 
02:04:11.549 --> 02:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
there were delays in getting that
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
program off the ground I believe there
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
were some rules that were required and
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
they had to go through the rule making
 
02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
process and so all of those funds have
 
02:04:21.229 --> 02:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
not been spent um this is a request to
 
02:04:24.109 --> 02:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
carry those dollars forward to be able
 
02:04:26.109 --> 02:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
to use in the for the program for the
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
coming bienia and I do not have the
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
exact amount of funds that are still
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
available but I will get that before we
 
02:04:38.109 --> 02:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
conversation the next provision there
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
givs to the state so in currently in RSA
 
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
48 the department or excuse me there is
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
a provision in statute where the
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections has the
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
authority to accept gifts and personal
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
property of less than $11,000 without
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
going through the GNC process um this
 
02:05:02.350 --> 02:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
this here would align with the level
 
02:05:04.109 --> 02:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Corrections has
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
for our 247
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
facilities um which includes New
 
02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital Glen Cliff home uh
 
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
the the future uh Youth Development
 
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
Center when we drafted this hamstad
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
hospital was also included at that stage
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
so if it goes over 10,000 it goes it has
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
to go to GNC um if this were passed if
 
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
it went over 1,000 then it would have to
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
go through GNC so New Hampshire hospital
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
often has uh gifts so if someone brings
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
in say uh a I don't know um chairs or
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
books or a used gaming console uh shoes
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh any of these types of things or if
 
02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
someone wants to give U Gifts or
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
presents for uh children at at youth at
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
YDC we have to go through the
 
02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
administrative proc process of um GNC
 
02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
approval this would essentially uh low
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
this this would increase that threshold
 
02:06:03.069 --> 02:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
um so we may have fewer trips uh and
 
02:06:06.189 --> 02:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
fewer uh requests to develop and submit
 
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
so anyone that wants to give significant
 
02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
money to the YDC to have it named after
 
02:06:15.149 --> 02:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
them uh that has to go to the GNC um I I
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
would assume so I've never seen that
 
02:06:18.510 --> 02:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
happen normally this is much smaller
 
02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
things like like uh you know shoes
 
02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
clothing things of that nature games
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
th000 bucks isn't much I just I just if
 
02:06:29.589 --> 02:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
there's a way to like increase that I I
 
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
I guess any increase triggers a
 
02:06:36.510 --> 02:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
requirement to go to the GNC though this
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
would actually establish this at $1,000
 
02:06:41.790 --> 02:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
it is not currently at $1,000 today no I
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
know it doesn't exist for you today I
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
want to both establish it for your
 
02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
department but $1,000 is too little I
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
want you to be able to take tremendous
 
02:06:57.229 --> 02:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
amounts more money than $1,000 CU that's
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's not even a bad broken car you
 
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
know um so so would you would you come
 
02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
back when you when you're ready or maybe
 
02:07:08.589 --> 02:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
you can just tell me now because I think
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
we would like to increase this gifting
 
02:07:14.189 --> 02:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
amount without
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
triggering a bunch of extra
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
work okay uh yeah we can we we can take
 
02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
that back and have a conversation
 
02:07:24.189 --> 02:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
back I'm looking forward to the walner
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
Youth Development
 
02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:28.549 align:start position:0%
Youth Development
Center

02:07:28.549 --> 02:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
Center
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
I represent no Ju Just a just a follow
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
up on that so you you have examples of
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
things that have been gifted right so
 
02:07:40.069 --> 02:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
you can look to see what the range of
 
02:07:41.549 --> 02:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
what you've had to go you know what the
 
02:07:43.149 --> 02:07:43.159 align:start position:0%
range of those gifts in the past has
 
02:07:45.310 --> 02:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
been and then maybe raise the limit to
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
the point where it you know
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
significantly cuts out trips to jnc
 
02:07:53.589 --> 02:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
right and maybe that answers uh uh
 
02:07:55.790 --> 02:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards it question it
 
02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't my my my question is just how
 
02:08:00.430 --> 02:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
big of a number can we take without it
 
02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
triggering a lot of extra paperwork and
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
that's probably in statute somewhere not
 
02:08:05.599 --> 02:08:06.870 align:start position:0%
that's probably in statute somewhere not
not

02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:08:09.390 --> 02:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
history yeah there's some rules within
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
mop 150 that are set by the um set by
 
02:08:14.189 --> 02:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
the executive Council that I think we
 
02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
would just need to kind of go back and
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
take a look at and have further internal
 
02:08:19.709 --> 02:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
conversations all right thank
 
02:08:22.109 --> 02:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
um still on page 49 towards the bottom
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
there is a provision there relative to
 
02:08:32.589 --> 02:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions being established
 
02:08:37.189 --> 02:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
in SB 417 laws of 2024 two classified
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
attorney positions were established the
 
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
problem is that in chapter 79 laws of
 
02:08:48.189 --> 02:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
2023 all of the DCF attorneys were
 
02:08:50.549 --> 02:08:50.559 align:start position:0%
converted from classified to
 
02:08:50.559 --> 02:08:52.149 align:start position:0%
converted from classified to
unclassified

02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
unclassified
 
02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
and so the 2024 Bill used sort of the
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
old Paradigm and what we're trying to do
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
here is is make it consistent so that
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
all the dcyf attorneys are unclassified
 
02:09:05.069 --> 02:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
so this creates two unclassified
 
02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
positions then the classified positions
 
02:09:08.549 --> 02:09:08.559 align:start position:0%
if they were filled they'd have an
 
02:09:11.790 --> 02:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to move into those um and
 
02:09:13.229 --> 02:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
then the classified positions would
 
02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
subsequently be abolished so there would
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
be a no net increase to the total number
 
02:09:20.669 --> 02:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
of positions it's um It's Complicated
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
cleanup I guess is the best way to put
 
02:09:28.589 --> 02:09:28.599 align:start position:0%
it on page 50 the congregate housing
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
program this is this has been suspended
 
02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
um in in Bia in past years this is
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
suspended for the current bayum because
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
02:09:40.030 --> 02:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
funded the next provision under the
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human Services
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
positions established Staffing amend RSA
 
02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
126-a 9 this is a section uh these next
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
couple uh sections here we worked with
 
02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
services to try to clean
 
02:09:56.830 --> 02:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
up uh some of the appointing authority
 
02:09:59.069 --> 02:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
language here the the Department
 
02:10:00.510 --> 02:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
administrative Services based on my
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
conversation with them they they've
 
02:10:04.549 --> 02:10:04.559 align:start position:0%
never been really happy with the way
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
that that the appointing authority for
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner relative to
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions read so we we
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
work with them and collaboratively came
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
up with this language and we've included
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
this here for consideration it's it's
 
02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
more technical in nature it doesn't
 
02:10:20.549 --> 02:10:20.559 align:start position:0%
establish any new positions doesn't
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
authorize any funds
 
02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
it it really tries to tie up the
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
language um and and make it clean so
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
that there are no interpretive
 
02:10:32.109 --> 02:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
questions there's also a repeal of the
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
appointment of an unclassified Mental
 
02:10:36.750 --> 02:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
Health Medical supervisor this goes back
 
02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
years I could not find anyone still in
 
02:10:41.709 --> 02:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
the department that remembers why this
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
was even in statute it doesn't establish
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
a position it basically told us to
 
02:10:48.669 --> 02:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
appoint this position um to our best
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge this has since been um
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
satisfied via the the Dartmouth contract
 
02:10:56.430 --> 02:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
that we have for Psychiatric Services
 
02:10:58.109 --> 02:10:58.119 align:start position:0%
and so we were recommending that that be
 
02:11:00.990 --> 02:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
struck from statute just to clean that
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
up uh following that you have the amend
 
02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:07.589 align:start position:0%
up uh following that you have the amend
RSA

02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
12683 this this is the um also part of
 
02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
the um the technical cleanup language
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
here uh sorry I'm just got lost here
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
there we go oh nope just kidding so
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
General Provisions at the about a Midway
 
02:11:28.069 --> 02:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
down page 50 this is there's currently
 
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that's out there that would
 
02:11:34.229 --> 02:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
establish or change the law to allow the
 
02:11:36.189 --> 02:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
department to purchase brand named drugs
 
02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
in the Medicaid Program currently
 
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
there's a restriction on that we only
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
purchase generic however included in the
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
governor's budget is a cost savings
 
02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
where we would see an increase in rebate
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue by purchasing a higher brand it
 
02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
make cost a little bit more to buy the
 
02:11:54.270 --> 02:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
brand name drug but what we would see on
 
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
the back end is higher increase rebate
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue so there is a bill out there
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
that has the same language that you see
 
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
here and uh this would effectively allow
 
02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
us to um it it's consistent with what is
 
02:12:10.030 --> 02:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
in the budget and what you see there I I
 
02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
can give you the exact number here
 
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
approximately uh $930,000 general fund
 
02:12:23.870 --> 02:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
benefit State fiscal year 26 and almost
 
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
a $3 million benefit in state fiscal
 
02:12:30.830 --> 02:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
year 27 by making this change to law so
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
so those numbers that you just gave us I
 
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
think I think part of what we got from
 
02:12:39.390 --> 02:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
the governor was uh five sections that
 
02:12:41.149 --> 02:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
were related to changes they were
 
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
recommending in
 
02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:43.990 align:start position:0%
recommending in
Medicaid

02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
um this was in that sheet wasn't it the
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
the changing of the uh Pharmacy ordering
 
02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
was that one of the five um I don't know
 
02:12:58.830 --> 02:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
which document you're referring to but
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
go ahead I'm just saying I think I think
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
it is and I think this was a good idea
 
02:13:04.830 --> 02:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
because we were always trying to save
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
money by ordering generics but now with
 
02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
the rebate programs it's gotten more
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
complex and we can actually save money
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
leveraging the rebate program and yes so
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
so this is just smart management and and
 
02:13:20.189 --> 02:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
this and and this just creates the
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility it doesn't create a mandate
 
02:13:25.229 --> 02:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
it it gives the the flexibility to order
 
02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
it that way yes yes to do the most cost-
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
effective thing possible okay all right
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
y so representative Daniels thank you if
 
02:13:37.069 --> 02:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
I heard you correctly you're saying that
 
02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
we would be getting the brand names
 
02:13:40.270 --> 02:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
because it would give us more of a
 
02:13:42.549 --> 02:13:42.559 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is that correct yes so we
 
02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
we're able to earn rebate revenue on on
 
02:13:47.149 --> 02:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
some of the prescriptions and by
 
02:13:49.229 --> 02:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
purchasing might be more expensive
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
upfront but we would see the benefit on
 
02:13:53.189 --> 02:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
the back side so what you see in the
 
02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
budget is you see General funds decrease
 
02:13:58.510 --> 02:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
by 930,000 you see other funds increase
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
by the equivalent
 
02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
amount so would at the federal level
 
02:14:04.990 --> 02:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
would we see an increase in price
 
02:14:06.990 --> 02:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
because they're using brand name drugs
 
02:14:10.109 --> 02:14:10.119 align:start position:0%
is as opposed to a decrease when they're
 
02:14:10.119 --> 02:14:11.109 align:start position:0%
is as opposed to a decrease when they're
using

02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
using
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
generics I mean are we just changing
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
from one one pocket to
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
another so I I I think it may be best to
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
have a more in-depth convers ation when
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
when Henry gets here and we can kind of
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
go into a little bit more of the details
 
02:14:27.629 --> 02:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
around what what this looks like on a
 
02:14:30.589 --> 02:14:30.599 align:start position:0%
daily basis CU they they have a they
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
their their pH the Medicaid pharmacist
 
02:14:35.229 --> 02:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
team they look at this stuff on a daily
 
02:14:36.750 --> 02:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
basis and probably get you a better
 
02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
course I think the principle though is
 
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
is that they they let's say you take a
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
nice brand name X and it happens to have
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
a generic
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
what we've been saying is don't order
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
the the the brand name X go get the
 
02:14:58.109 --> 02:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
generic because we think that's going to
 
02:15:00.750 --> 02:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
save us money well what we figured out
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
is that we can actually order brand name
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
X but because there's a rebate program
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
associated with it the the the drug
 
02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
price minus the rebate is cheaper than
 
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
it we ordered the generic and so this is
 
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
just an alternative way to where we're
 
02:15:21.870 --> 02:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
netting savings is the goal of this
 
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
yeah my my question Mr chair is is it
 
02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
costing us more at the federal level to
 
02:15:33.430 --> 02:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
Litman okay um so moving on to the next
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
provision in the middle of page 51 in
 
02:15:44.350 --> 02:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
hb2 the current bium an appropriation
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
was made in 2.8 million for a pilot
 
02:15:50.589 --> 02:15:50.599 align:start position:0%
program um in in the DD service realm
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
and the SE were individuals that uh did
 
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
not qualify under the under the waiver
 
02:15:58.990 --> 02:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
itself um I believe there's currently
 
02:16:00.669 --> 02:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
eight individuals what this
 
02:16:03.390 --> 02:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation does is allows us to carry
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
forward those unspent dollars to
 
02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
continue providing services to
 
02:16:08.189 --> 02:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
individuals that are currently in the
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
program who will be aging out during
 
02:16:11.159 --> 02:16:11.870 align:start position:0%
program who will be aging out during
this

02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
bium and it's it's more of a one-time
 
02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
thing to prevent those dollars from
 
02:16:18.910 --> 02:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
lapsing and those services from ending
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
before those individuals uh potentially
 
02:16:23.109 --> 02:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
qualify for waiver Services when they
 
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
age into
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
it the so the impact is no new money
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
we're going to be spending down the laps
 
02:16:35.629 --> 02:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be graduating the
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
final eight without adding back more new
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
people in the future correct
 
02:16:46.589 --> 02:16:46.599 align:start position:0%
okay the next provision here at the
 
02:16:51.389 --> 02:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 51 so s SP 463 three
 
02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
passed last session laws of
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
2024 and it had an effective date of
 
02:16:57.790 --> 02:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
July 1 of
 
02:17:03.389 --> 02:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
2025 that bill created um a pretty hefty
 
02:17:05.349 --> 02:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
workload on the department I believe the
 
02:17:07.709 --> 02:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal note had identified a need of 14
 
02:17:10.429 --> 02:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
additional positions um we included
 
02:17:12.629 --> 02:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs requests for those 14
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
additional positions um that that we
 
02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:17.519 align:start position:0%
were that that was not included and so
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
what has been included here is a delayed
 
02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
effective date for the subsequent bium
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
um given that those positions uh do not
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
exist and have no funding so in order to
 
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
effectuate the purposes of the bill um
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be resources available to
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
do so so so who's done the biggest Deep
 
02:17:38.309 --> 02:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
dive and who kind of owns this issue
 
02:17:42.509 --> 02:17:42.519 align:start position:0%
with n DHHS the the director of DCF or
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
one of the associate Commissioners or
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
who who's kind of the person that if I
 
02:17:49.469 --> 02:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
want to really dig through this who who
 
02:17:51.469 --> 02:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
I should be talking to yes so associate
 
02:17:55.629 --> 02:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh Trish Tilly and um DCF
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
director Marie Nunan can we see the
 
02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
Marie Nunan n o NN yeah can assist you
 
02:18:04.990 --> 02:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
with any questions you have on that one
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
so miss Tilly would you rather I go
 
02:18:09.669 --> 02:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
through you or go straight to miss
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
Nunan all
 
02:18:16.589 --> 02:18:16.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:19.469 --> 02:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
you question so that effectively moves
 
02:18:21.070 --> 02:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
it out of this by any is is that what
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
this is saying yeah okay but but there
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
are still what 12 other positions or
 
02:18:28.110 --> 02:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of positions still that
 
02:18:30.429 --> 02:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
that aren't affected by this right
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
correct and and those those positions
 
02:18:35.070 --> 02:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
were were formally established via the
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
legislation yeah all
 
02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
right the next item is County cap which
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it it is just below uh the Canon
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
Mountain Tramway it's County
 
02:18:59.629 --> 02:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of funds limitations on
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
payments and this this goes back to the
 
02:19:04.990 --> 02:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
conversation that we had the week prior
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
around the um the funding methodology
 
02:19:11.469 --> 02:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
that state employs for choices for
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
Independence and Nursing Facility
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid payments and what this
 
02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
provision does here is this amends RSA
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
16718 a and in that section of Statute
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
that is where the quote unquote County
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
cap is uh I.E the amount of um money
 
02:19:31.950 --> 02:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
that the counties contribute towards the
 
02:19:34.349 --> 02:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
CFI and Nursing Facility Medicaid waiver
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
payments and the adjustment here this
 
02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
reflects the 2% maximum increase that's
 
02:19:43.709 --> 02:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
allowable under statute uh for the banum
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
and this this is something that you'll
 
02:19:47.309 --> 02:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
see in hb2 every year because that's
 
02:19:49.309 --> 02:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
where this provision is typically
 
02:19:49.319 --> 02:19:51.030 align:start position:0%
where this provision is typically
adjusted

02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
adjusted
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
so so is this showing up as other
 
02:19:56.830 --> 02:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue somewhere in hb1 yep so in
 
02:19:58.510 --> 02:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
2152 um you will see a number close to
 
02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
this but different from this what you'll
 
02:20:07.870 --> 02:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
see in that accounting unit is you will
 
02:20:12.750 --> 02:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
see the county cap here minus the credit
 
02:20:15.630 --> 02:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's also stipulated in RSA
 
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
678a which is $5 million default so what
 
02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
you'll end up seeing there is an amount
 
02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
of $5 million less than what you
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
actually see in statute because of that
 
02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
credit so this will never ma this
 
02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
generally speaking will not match the
 
02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
accounting unit other fund Revenue line
 
02:20:38.910 --> 02:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
so so the effect of that credit is it
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
actually effectively reduces the amount
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
the counties have to pay correct okay
 
02:20:47.550 --> 02:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
and then you know that there's this
 
02:20:51.550 --> 02:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussion about um the covid
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
era collection of either 22.3 million or
 
02:20:57.910 --> 02:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
25 million depending on what the most
 
02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
recent final number is yes
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
um one one way to potentially deal with
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
that would be to to what increase the
 
02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
credit so that so that they would start
 
02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
to get get that money back and it would
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
look like reduced revenues to
 
02:21:18.910 --> 02:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
us that is certainly one way that you
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
could do that if you if you were to do
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
that what you would end up seeing in the
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
accounting unit is um let me see here so
 
02:21:32.590 --> 02:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
currently the private local funds it's a
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
005 line on page 903 of the budget and
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 2152 shows up about 129
 
02:21:42.590 --> 02:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
million and 132 million each year uh
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
what what you would end up seeing there
 
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
is is you would see the 129 minus 11 or
 
02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
the 132 minus 11 but what you'd also
 
02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
need to do is increase the general fund
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
contributions within that line so the
 
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
first year of the budget would go up to
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
about n almost 96 million in the second
 
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
year of the budget would be about uh
 
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
almost $18 $109
 
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
million um in in general fund so that
 
02:22:08.110 --> 02:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
credit would me to be compensated by the
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
general funds right so so I think this
 
02:22:14.429 --> 02:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
is a yes or no did did the did the
 
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
governor's budget include that
 
02:22:19.950 --> 02:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
additional 22 or 25 million back to the
 
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
counties no the governor's budget did
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
not includ so we'd have to basically be
 
02:22:28.469 --> 02:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
finding additional money to fund that uh
 
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
that re rebate or reimbursement correct
 
02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:33.270 align:start position:0%
that re rebate or reimbursement correct
all

02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
right good what else you got so that is
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
all of the current hb2 Provisions um
 
02:22:43.950 --> 02:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
that are available today I do expect um
 
02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
come Friday we may have some additional
 
02:22:49.389 --> 02:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
hb2 Provisions to discuss relative to uh
 
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid eligibility premiums and cost
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
sharing may may I ask you a couple
 
02:22:55.550 --> 02:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
Strays sure they don't need to be
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
answered today but uh I'm I'm looking at
 
02:23:02.750 --> 02:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
the the capital budget uh and there's uh
 
02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
the Medica Medicaid expense modular
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
strategy um that's going to end up um
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
being around 33.7 million uh it's a it's
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
a it's it's not itemized or broken out
 
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
um but if you could get Mr weeders uh
 
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
when he comes in for it to to to break
 
02:23:27.230 --> 02:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
out what's what's in that and and in
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
particular what I what I'd like to know
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
is what the uh contract service support
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
is so so like if we get this Capital
 
02:23:39.790 --> 02:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
item approved does it come with its own
 
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
project managers wrapped in it or or do
 
02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
we have to pay for the project managers
 
02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
out of
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
operations so that that's just it's a
 
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
big it's a big thing um and then
 
02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
modernize eligibility Services it's not
 
02:23:59.389 --> 02:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
quite as big but I'd like to have Mr
 
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
weers just talk about it at a high level
 
02:24:05.349 --> 02:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
with sort of the same similar thing as
 
02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
what is the operational impact on on uh
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
it service support for
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
contractors sure okay that that that's
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's a future thing and then uh I I
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
had a a very nice Exchange with uh with
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner Landry uh today I think do
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
I call you commissioner I keep
 
02:24:29.790 --> 02:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
forgetting all your titles Miss Landry
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
um we found uh you you know I've been a
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
a an Ardent supporter saying I don't
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
think the department uh does
 
02:24:43.469 --> 02:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
Dei and um and we found on the UNH
 
02:24:47.070 --> 02:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
website something titled uh NH office of
 
02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
Health Equity and it's a it's got
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
several pages
 
02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
and uh this uh is is is written by UNH I
 
02:24:57.469 --> 02:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
guess but it's talking about the office
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
of Health Equity which I think belongs
 
02:25:02.830 --> 02:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
to the department um and in the exchange
 
02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
of emails I think I think Miss Landry um
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
said that this is an old dead program
 
02:25:12.469 --> 02:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
and that this is not anything that's
 
02:25:14.429 --> 02:25:14.439 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the future would you
 
02:25:16.429 --> 02:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
would you you can sit at the end I think
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:21.349 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:25:21.359 --> 02:25:25.230 align:start position:0%
this
is

02:25:25.230 --> 02:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:28.030 --> 02:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
90% good afternoon an Landry associate
 
02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner yeah
 
02:25:33.309 --> 02:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
um do you want me to address your so yes
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
I to our understanding that that that is
 
02:25:39.870 --> 02:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
not a current offering of of the
 
02:25:41.710 --> 02:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
department or the office of Health
 
02:25:46.110 --> 02:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
Equity in fact um my guess is it it
 
02:25:48.750 --> 02:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
might have been something that someone
 
02:25:50.510 --> 02:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
in our department who no longer work
 
02:25:52.950 --> 02:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
here was trained to do and maybe there
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
was a request but it's not a training um
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
internally or externally and it predates
 
02:26:00.990 --> 02:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
our current director's time so I
 
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing that to our um
 
02:26:05.269 --> 02:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
awareness I actually couldn't find it
 
02:26:07.309 --> 02:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
myself when I Googled it or looked at
 
02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
the UNH website it almost looks like
 
02:26:11.630 --> 02:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's an internal document internal
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
website to UNH so we are doing our due
 
02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
diligence and ensuring that all of any
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
any vendor um who lists any of our
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
training that we offer for the
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
Department are are current and up to
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
date so I I appreciate that
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
questions I'm that document appeared on
 
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
a UNH worksite I think or a
 
02:26:39.269 --> 02:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
website and but it did uh show that it
 
02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
was a
 
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS document so I'm I'm not
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure I understood what you
 
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
know I I was unaware that that document
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
existed and I you know I'm remiss to say
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
that but to that is not a current
 
02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
offering of the Departments or of the
 
02:27:02.910 --> 02:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity in fact I
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
believe it predates um even maybe my
 
02:27:07.950 --> 02:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
time overseeing the office of Health
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
Equity it's not clear but we do not
 
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
offer that training and we were unaware
 
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
that that was on a list on the UNH
 
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
website so we're doing our due diligence
 
02:27:20.349 --> 02:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that any place offer that
 
02:27:23.150 --> 02:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
shows our trainings that we offer it's
 
02:27:24.990 --> 02:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
that it's up to dat and
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
current so you you'll get back to us
 
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
after you do the due diligence
 
02:27:33.469 --> 02:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
or to ensure that it's been removed that
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
the current lists are all we we are in
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
the process of doing that we're they
 
02:27:39.429 --> 02:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
Ruben reached out to them today to take
 
02:27:41.870 --> 02:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
take down that list but we're also
 
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
looking at any um to making sure that
 
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
all of our trainings regardless of what
 
02:27:48.429 --> 02:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
they are are up to date regardless of
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
the topic um because that was that was
 
02:27:53.950 --> 02:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
an old document okay so so it's possible
 
02:27:55.710 --> 02:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
at some point to get get a list of all
 
02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
of the trainings oh sure yes sorry I
 
02:28:00.349 --> 02:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
miss your question we can do that yes so
 
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
is that your request is that we get a
 
02:28:04.910 --> 02:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
set a list of trainings that the
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
department provides just yeah I would
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
are you looking specifically for office
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
of Health Equity or are you looking
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
across the entire department what what's
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
what's I'm look across the entire
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
department um do you do you have a
 
02:28:22.750 --> 02:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
comment on the workload effected yeah
 
02:28:25.389 --> 02:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
that that may that may be a pretty hefty
 
02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
load given that across all of our
 
02:28:29.070 --> 02:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
divisions we're doing dozens if not
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
hundreds of trainings I think what I
 
02:28:32.269 --> 02:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
heard your question asking was why there
 
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
was co-branding on that particular
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
document and wanting to be assured that
 
02:28:39.309 --> 02:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
this is not a training that's provided
 
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
endorsed or paid for by DHHS which we
 
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
can assure you based on the work um
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner Landry did this
 
02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
weekend there's no connection to DHHS
 
02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
with that train and it predates all of
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
us does that does that address the
 
02:28:55.590 --> 02:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
concern or are you actually looking for
 
02:28:59.190 --> 02:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
more information around trainings from I
 
02:29:00.389 --> 02:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
was looking for some additional
 
02:29:02.910 --> 02:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
information without unnecessarily
 
02:29:06.190 --> 02:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
increasing the workload but definitely
 
02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'll would be interested in additional
 
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
information on on is there is there any
 
02:29:12.990 --> 02:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
other department I mean because of the
 
02:29:15.309 --> 02:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
naming people are concerned about office
 
02:29:17.550 --> 02:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
of Health Equity but would there be any
 
02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
other uh Department Public Health he or
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
or any other department that would be
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
worried about sort of this cultural
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
sensitivity kind of training that that
 
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
instead of asking for the entire
 
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
department we limit what we're looking
 
02:29:35.230 --> 02:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
for I think yeah why don't we if it's
 
02:29:36.990 --> 02:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
okay with you maybe let's huddle after
 
02:29:38.510 --> 02:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
this with the associate Commissioners
 
02:29:40.469 --> 02:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
and get right back to you with um a
 
02:29:42.070 --> 02:29:42.080 align:start position:0%

02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:44.560 align:start position:0%

02:29:47.710 --> 02:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
