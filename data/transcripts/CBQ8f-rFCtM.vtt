Mickey landan thank you represent uh for
 
00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 align:start position:0%
the record my name is uh Mickey landrian
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh you see it listed as Mick landrian
 
00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
here or there my real name is Michael
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
Mickey's Fine you can call me that um
 
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
I've been with the office for almost 18
 
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
years now I've been doing budget work
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
since the 2011 session was my first
 
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
budget so and uh that first year I was
 
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
with division one every year since I've
 
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
been in division 2 so this has become
 
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
pretty familiar territory for me um most
 
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
of the members here were here last year
 
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
with division 2 um I know we have two
 
00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
brand new members representative Kelly's
 
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
not brand new to the house she knows the
 
00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 align:start position:0%
uh very familiar so it's good to see her
 
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
um but yeah I can get right into it I
 
00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
don't know if you wanted to at some
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
point today talk about just how the
 
00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 align:start position:0%
division runs differently from how the
 
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
full committee as as we're a
 
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I can kind of assist
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
with that um before we get into anything
 
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
anything else so uh this is a
 
00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of house finance so uh a
 
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
lot of the same
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
procedures are followed but it is much
 
00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
more informal than across the way so we
 
00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
all this committee will do is
 
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
essentially give recommendations to the
 
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
full committee for exec we don't have
 
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
exec sessions in here we don't have
 
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
public hearings in here uh any public in
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
so just a question on that um because I
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
know you and I talked about this and
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
that's what you said but again this
 
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
morning uh chairman wer said I think you
 
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
were still there when he said we we'll
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
have a we'll have full public hearings
 
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
here and and then they'll go to the the
 
00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
Committees he he used the term hearings
 
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
I think he probably meant meetings um we
 
00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 align:start position:0%
won't have public hearings in here we'll
 
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
have work sessions in here on bills and
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
of course on House Bill one and two like
 
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
the budget but just for the two new
 
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
members we do vote in here you vote in
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
division two don't you we do we vote to
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
make recommendations correct so
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
um uh bills will be referred to us after
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
the full committee has the public
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
hearing we'll schedule a work session on
 
00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
those bills on those days and then yeah
 
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
we'll vote on you know same motions an
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
ought to pass a retain itl whatever and
 
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
and recommend that back to the full
 
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
committee at which a motion will be made
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the full committee which is what the
 
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
division recommended and then the
 
00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
official vote will be in the full
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
see yeah EV I'll
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
remember um just to I guess you
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
historically just to put it out there
 
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
for new members and uh let me know um
 
00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
chair if you you will agree uh we've
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
always been open to having testimony or
 
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
hearings from you know the public that
 
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
they've always been able to participate
 
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
and you know give their perspective on
 
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
things and we've been able to listen to
 
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
them um that's been the way it's been
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
since I've been on finance and just to
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
iterate that hopefully that will
 
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
continue that's fine with me um but give
 
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
me a heads up that when you're wanting
 
00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
anybody well we did division three to
 
00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
but we didn't just like let anybody's
 
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
rip up there and start shooting the
 
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
breeze we okay okay yeah so so that's
 
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
the point from a technical perspective
 
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
I'm saying like the public will always
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
have uh a public hearing on all pieces
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
of legislation including the budget H
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
Bill one and two will have its own
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
separate public hearing uh and then when
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
it comes to division work when we're
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
doing work sessions that's the
 
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
prerogative of the committee of the
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
chair to invite whomever uh agency folks
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
Advocates lobbyists public to to input
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
uh but that would be up to the committee
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
long so I'm trying to think of other
 
00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.790 align:start position:0%
long so I'm trying to think of other
just

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
general division 2 procedural things I I
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
clerk represent where does that
 
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
stand thank
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
you yes representative I just wanted to
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
add my thanks to representative DY for
 
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
agreeing to serve as a clerk especially
 
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
as a you know first term member first
 
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
term on finance it stuff but we'll offer
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
all the support that you need thank you
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
be able to focus on what's being said
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to interpret what
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
said so I'll need all of your help and
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
and patience so tap him if you want me
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
to slow down because I'm I talk quickly
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm glad to slow down whenever have
 
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
no problem with
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
that and as far as recordkeeping to that
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
point um all the meetings will be be
 
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
recorded and streamed on YouTube uh the
 
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
microphones are important because the
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
the audio will not pick it up if you're
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
not speaking into a microphone it is a
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
small room and you know we can hear each
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
other but nothing will be picked up on
 
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
the stream unless we're in in a
 
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
microphone so that's important to just
 
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
remember to flip it on every time we're
 
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.589 align:start position:0%
remember to flip it on every time we're
we're

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
speaking um as far as scheduling uh as
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
of right now you probably all got the
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
notices um that we do have some agency
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
presentations coming up next week we're
 
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
open uh starting the week of the 27th
 
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
we'll have uh higher education on uh
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
that day Monday the 27th fishing game
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
safety and Dot the 29th and then that
 
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
following week we'll have two separate
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
days of Department of Education to come
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
in to talk about some state aid programs
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
uh the purpose of these oh go ahead just
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
one moment I'm sorry to interrupt but
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
that kind of information you don't need
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
to take notes because that's in the
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
calendar okay so you'll you'll kind of
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
learn what you don't need about the
 
00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:24.430 align:start position:0%
learn what you don't need about the
writing

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
down go ahead actually push the thing
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
actually I went to see J Janet and she's
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
going to give me samples of what has
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
been done in the past so that I can take
 
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:38.039 align:start position:0%
those home with me and kind of study
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
them and see what's important in in the
 
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:41.959 align:start position:0%
group but if somebody has something
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
special they want written down for today
 
00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
I think all you have to do is is state
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
that our LBA um um Mr landan provid us
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
an overview of the procedures for the
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
committee and um the overview of what
 
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing that's probably
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
enough pretty much the time we start the
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
time we
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
end yeah we we started at
 
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
nose so the purpose of those initial
 
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
hearings is really to familiarize our
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
new members with some of the subject um
 
00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
subjects in the agencies you'll be
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh as well as a refresher
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
for the returning members it's a meet
 
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
and greet there may be some new people
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
at the Departments that weren't there
 
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
two years ago uh and it's good to get
 
00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
some exposure and uh some information
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
prior to when the budget is handed to us
 
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
I think just getting a little bit of a
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
head start just helps and makes us more
 
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
efficient in the time that we do have
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
and speaking of the time we do have I
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
did uh you know not to panic anybody so
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
I did do a count of how many days I I do
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
have um March 26th as our is what we
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
should Target as it's Wednesday March
 
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
26th as the target date to have the
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
division done all of its recommendations
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
have be done all of its work um and that
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
will include um House Bill one and two
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
as well as any other bills that get
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
referred to us as of right now only five
 
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
bills have been referred to finance and
 
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
none of them are division two which is
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
good so we have nothing to start but at
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
some point we will get possibly still
 
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
first committee bills but definitely
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
second committee bills that we'll have
 
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
to work on um so between February 18th
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
which is the Monday following the
 
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
holiday weekend when the budget comes
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
out until the 26th including the 26
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
there's 27 business days in there
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
whether whether we have a break or not
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
that could be five or up to five the
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
school vacation week last year during
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
that period there were six house session
 
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
days so those are six days we're not
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to have one day is town meeting
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
day and one day we will have a public
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill one and two so
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
those are ones we know of that's that
 
00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:52.519 align:start position:0%
brings us down to 14 days plus or minus
 
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
the vacation week but then we'll also
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
have public hearings on other bills
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
we'll also have work sessions on other
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
bills we're going to get so the amount
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
of time that we have is somewhat limited
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
so we just need to remember to be as
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
efficient as we can with the days we
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
have repres g m thank you Mr chair which
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
is why I would you know suggest like we
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
always do that we frontload our meetings
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
as we've been doing and continue to be
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
aggressive in frontloading them because
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
anything we can take care of in Terms of
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
General background before we have the
 
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
actual budget and start working on the
 
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
numbers would be you know work out of
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
the and then we can focus on the hard
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
part and I should just add something
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
here um you know we talked about the
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
government with the agency budgets but
 
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
we didn't talk about that but I think we
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
briefly mentioned that this morning and
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
then the governor's budget the agency
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
budgets are currently available online
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
so those can be uh downloaded
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
electronically um and they provide the
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
information about what the agencies have
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
requested based on what governor
 
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
sonunu previous governor sonunu had
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
suggested last summer when he when they
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
started their process of you looking at
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
a 4% budget cut so if you want to get a
 
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
heads up on the budget you can actually
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
start looking at them they're
 
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
available no it's a great Point uh the
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
agency budget requests have also last
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
year's actual expenditures this current
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
Year's um authorized budget as well as
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
like what the agencies are requesting
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
for the next two years and a lot of
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
narrative in there about separate
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
programs different accounting units so
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
especially for the new members it's a
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
massive document but you could hone in
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
on just our division two agencies and
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
probably learn a little bit to get ready
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
for um when the budget does come to us
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
in addition all of the agencies did do a
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
presentation to the governor's uh budget
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
director and and some staff uh relative
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
to those budget requests and all of them
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
had a handout so those handouts are also
 
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
posted online and I'll email that link
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
to the committee and those are good
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
useful documents to just kind of
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
familiarize yourself with just to do a
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
little homework on your own and in fact
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
the if you download the pdf version of
 
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
the agency budget
 
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:07.959 align:start position:0%
requests those also include not just the
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't look just like hb1 but it also
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
has a bunch of related notes that go
 
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
with every one of the different um
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
categories that you can read about if
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
you want to know why they're why they
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
things so that's kind of what the
 
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
Outlook is as far as uh scheduling um
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
kind of back to what our office can
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
provide and and does provide so Mike
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
Kane went through it this morning won't
 
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
dive into all that again but as far as
 
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
for division 2 I'm I'm your analyst so
 
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
I'm your guy um I'll be in here every

full committee when we have public
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
hearings or exec sessions on bills that
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
we're uh will be assigned to division 2
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%

00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
reach out to me our contact information
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
was there even if it's for new members
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
to understand something or experienced
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%

00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
anything just reach out to me um
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
amendments to that came up this morning
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of amendments
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
for house pill 2 you may want to draft
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
an amendment for one of the bills that's
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
in our committee just I can assist with
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
that if I found it's just easier to uh
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
if I'm part of that process I can just
 
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
kind of keep everything focused and and
 
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:18.519 align:start position:0%
make sure nothing falls through the
 
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.079 align:start position:0%
cracks for the committee um that kind of
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
covers most of
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
that does anyone have any questions
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
either from this morning's presentation
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
prepared so I did hand out a couple
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
documents nothing is brand new it's
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
stuff that's either been online or even
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
was part of your packet this morning uh
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
one is the kind of a lot of numbers the
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
agency budget um requests high level
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
department totals and we'll start with
 
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
that one so what I've done here is just
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
highlighted our agencies so in in
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
division 2 we'll be responsible for the
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
Safety the fishing game department the
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation Department of Education
 
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
the uh Lottery Commission the police
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
standards and training and the
 
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
university system of New Hampshire and
 
00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
the community college system of New
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so in a nutshell you know
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
safety fishing game Transportation
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
education um
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
so we don't have a whole lot of agencies
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
but we have a lot of money and a lot of
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
programs within those
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
agencies we don't if you look on the
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
first page this is all funds it's the
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
front and back of that first uh page and
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
then if you look on the next one it's
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
just general funds only we don't have a
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
ton of General funds in division 2 once
 
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
you back out the higher education
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
University and the community college
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
system we don't have a ton of General
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
funds appropriated within division 2
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
that's said we have a lot of Education
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
trust funds a lot of Highway funds
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds federal funds restricted
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
accounts fishing game funds so that's
 
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
one of the nuances of division two is
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different fund
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
types and so just to be clear especially
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
for the the new folks education trust
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
funds are very similar to General funds
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of they're coming
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
from the general taxes and things that
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
we collect there's some special things
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
that go into the education trust fund
 
00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
and there's limitations on what the
 
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
education trust funds can be used for
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
but they're different from federal funds
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
they're different from your Highway
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
funds which is the tolls or the gas gas
 
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
tax the road toll High F Highway fund is
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
the road toll which is also the gas tax
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
yeah and then the turnpike fund is the
 
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
toll booths yeah so that's yeah it's so
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
those are sort of special but in terms
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
of Education trust funds just so you're
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with it there're they're
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
similar to General funds in terms of
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
their where they come from but they have
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
some restrictions on the education trust
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
funds in terms of what they can be used
 
00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:02.350 align:start position:0%
funds in terms of what they can be used
for

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
so so like I said I gave you this just
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
as a reference just so it's clear which
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
agencies we will be looking at which
 
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
budgets we'll be looking at uh the next
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
document I handed out I I'm not even
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
going to really go into it uh that
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
snapshot that our office presented to
 
00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:18.039 align:start position:0%
the Ways and Means Committee at the
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
Joint economic briefing earlier this
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
week that's just for your your reference
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
in case you didn't already see that many
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
of you probably have or uh know the
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
number but that's a document that's
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
going to change almost daily it's
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
already different from when we publish
 
00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:32.039 align:start position:0%
it Monday so as revenues are coming in
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
as spending occurs as the uh annual
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report is
 
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
audited and finaly those numbers are
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
going to move
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
around and then the third document I
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
gave you this is one that you'll see
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat routinely at least the last
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
page of it so this is the final packet
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
of recommendations from house house
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
finance division 2 from two years ago so
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
this was the house bill one and
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
two uh DEC or recommendations that this
 
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
committee made and it kind of gives you
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
a glimpse of the tracking sheets that we
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
we will use here that I'll update every
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
time we meet essentially with the uh
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations made to date and the
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
pending recommendations that you still
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
have to figure out so for this first
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
page is uh essentially just all the
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
sections from House Bill one the back of
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
house bill one and House Bill 2 so last
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
year when House Bill 2 was introduced uh
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
80 some odd sections of of the Bill were
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
referred to division two so each one one
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
of those this committee will have to go
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
through and decide do you like it do you
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
want to support it do you want to delete
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
it do you want to amend it so all of
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
those this committee will have to vote
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
on and back to votes um
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
typically typically it's a show of hands
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
in here but we definitely have done roll
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
calls too and that's up to the chair to
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
decide of the committee to collectively
 
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
decide on whatever the issue is how you
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
want to to do a vote um so just to kind
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
of show you
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
this document here I'll give you this
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
when we get a new house built to in a
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
month or so and then all of these
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
columns on the far right the action
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
column will be blank when we start and
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
then as we start making decisions we'll
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
start checking off some of these
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
boxes if you flip to the next page if
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
you look down
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
below this is where many of our bills
 
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
that came to the
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
committee how they were added to house
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
bill to so for instance down at the
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
bottom under the the other house bill
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
two amendments there was a bill House
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 542 that was referred to this
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
committee relative to establishing a
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
position at the department of education
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
division 2 supported that so we amended
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 to add that language into
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
house bill two so I'll keep track of all
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
of those bills that are referred to us
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
as well as House Bill 2 just to make
 
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
sure nothing hopefully falls through the
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
cracks flipping to the next page this is
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
just showing all the decisions that were
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
made in house bill one you're going to
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
get a lot of agency budget requests
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to say the governor's
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
budget didn't fund this or or we need
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
these technical changes made or whatever
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
as you start making those decisions and
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
I'll do the data entry into the budget
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
system which is somewhat time consuming
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
so some things I may request that you
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
consider early you know so that'll give
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
me time uh I'll also track these for you
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
so you know how you're doing to date the
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
decisions you've made Etc um it's a page
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
two of that document and I will keep a
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
running total of uh all of your actions
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
today just so know your overall either
 
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
spending or cutting or whatever you're
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
doing by fund because that'll be
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
important and then speaking of by
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
fund the next three pages of this packet
 
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
are we'll call them Surplus
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
statements of the education trust fund
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and then the fishing
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
game fund so it's somewhat the
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this division to
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
ensure those three funds are balanced in
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
the way that you want to recommend to
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
the full committee so like I said this
 
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
was what division 2 finalized two years
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
ago so in the case of the education
 
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
trust fund all of the revenues up top
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
will be a ways and means thing right so
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to come up with Revenue
 
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
estimates but all the Appropriations
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
down below that'll be part of your
 
00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:17.799 align:start position:0%
budget package so when you're
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
determining adequate education Charter
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
Schools School building Aid all those
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
things we're going to keep an eye on how
 
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
this is looking for the uh education
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
any questions to this point I know it's
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
a lot I don't want to do a whole lot
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
today diving in but representative
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
papich M thank you Mr chair not as much
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
a question as a note to both Miki and
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee um last
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
budget cycle um you know we didn't give
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game a humongous amount of time
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
because uh you know they were mostly
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
self-funded and what not and we had a
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
lot of bigger fish to fry having been
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
serving I have served on
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
statutory committee uh you know Senate
 
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
house committee to look at the revenue
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
funds and provide recommendations and U
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
some of the things I've learned during
 
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
that committee I think will lead to us
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
having to give a heightened level of
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
scrutiny to fish and game than we've
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
done in previous Cycles because they are
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
very insistent on their need to get
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
direct Appropriations from the general
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
fund as part of their budget and that's
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
a very different type of situation than
 
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
what we've had in the past so I just
 
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you a heads up that when
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
we budget for it when you think about it
 
00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:32.919 align:start position:0%
in terms of workload that we may have
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
more work there than we had in the past
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
because of that change in
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
you uh well I actually have an example
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the fishing game Surplus statement
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
here in a couple Pages you can see that
 
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:48.919 align:start position:0%
um but as far as education back to that
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
real quick that that is by far the
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
biggest component of this division in my
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
opinion because it's uh huge dollar
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
amount when you talk about adequacy or
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
education Trust fund expenditures
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
between Charter Schools adequacy School
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
building adfas um but it's also a lot of
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
it state aid so that's usually a tough
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
decision to make this year is a new year
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
that you have a new standing committee
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
in the house an education funding
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee so a lot of bills I look back
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
two years ago I think we had eight bills
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
that were first referred to this
 
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
committee that now those types of bills
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
are going to the Ed funding committee
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
first so in theory house policy should
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
be vetted out on some of those things
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
and we have fewer bills maybe with a
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
house position on them as they come to
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
this committee um and I know we have two
 
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
members on this division who are also on
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
that committee so there should be a
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
bridge between the work of of both um so
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
that'll be hopefully a little bit less
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
work that's done in this committee as it
 
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559 align:start position:0%
should be a a policy determined before
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
it comes here um so yes the highway fund
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
too that's that's another one that
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
perennially is
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's there's a lot of decision
 
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
making there there's been a lot of
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
onetime fixes so to speak of the Highway
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
fund over the years whether it's you
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
know a temporary change in some revenue
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
or using different sources of funds to
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
pay things at the highway fund typically
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh would pay for um I'm expecting to see
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
that budget come to us not super uh
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
what's the word flush with money I guess
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
unless there's you know some massive
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
changes just based on kind of what we've
 
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
seen the last couple years uh and then
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund um similar thing but
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
to a smaller uh total dollar amount on
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
the next page you can see that when the
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
governor's budget comes out we may or
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
may not have an audited AER but we'll
 
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
have something a preliminary draft that
 
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
we can at least build these Surplus
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
statements off of so you can do your
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
work education trust fund Highway fund
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
fishing aame should be pretty good I
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
would think by that draft that we'll be
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
using for for Budget work question about
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
the act for the de wanted to ask it this
 
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
morning but it was kind of busy uh is
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
there any reason they can't we can't
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
get like the one the UN the incomplete
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
version that just doesn't have in the
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
pieces related to Lottery we we probably
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
will for when we start our work February
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
15th because the governor to show that
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
her budget package is balanced we'll
 
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:12.039 align:start position:0%
have to use you we'll have balancing
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
documents there's been preliminary
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
drafts that have been given that we're I
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
think that this is the snapshot was
 
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
based off of one in November we received
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
was the last one so we have been getting
 
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
some preliminary numbers but knowing
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
that the final number is is still coming
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
so it's obviously coming to fiscal to
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
request an extension at least from this
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
morning yeah can we um on the fiscal
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
committee dictate that that we need to
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
have something released not at least
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
released to that to the finance
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
committee I think a request can be made
 
00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:44.919 align:start position:0%
out if you can dictate necessarily but
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
we can put we can put yeah we can put a
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
request in and see what uh the
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
controller is able to release as far as
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
a preliminary draft that could be used
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
but like I said there's not there's not
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
a ton of use for it for us yet to have
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
it until the governor's budget comes out
 
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
and we'll have whatever she uses which
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
should be in theory the latest and
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
greatest at the time that is available
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
so we should have something for February
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
you the last piece of paper on this
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
packet so this is
 
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
a a a list that I'll keep as agencies
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
come in and do their presentation of all
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
of the requests and outstanding uh items
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
that either the agencies have asked for
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
or the bills that exist just kind of a
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
and I'll update this every single day
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
that we meet just so it the committee
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
knows what requests were made and as you
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
start deciding on them this one
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
indicates shading so for instance uh the
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
first block of department of safety
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
items you can see the item on Row one
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
was approved the next few were not item
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
on row 181 1920 were approved so I'll
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
just keep this as a tracking sheet is a
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
one pager that this committee can always
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
look to and say okay these are the
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
outstanding requests compiled from all
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
of our agencies as we go
 
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
through represent papich M thank you so
 
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
just to clarify for everybody Miki the
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
dark border around something means that
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
the governor denied that request but we
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
are being told about the request because
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
it will probably brought be brought back
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
to us the on the the lines without the
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
Border are the ones that as of now the
 
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
government the government seems to be
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
willing to include in her
 
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
budget no the I think the borders here
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
were uh some of these items had multiple
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
funds so I bordered dark bordered the
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
total of that request so if you look at
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
that item 3 four five and six is
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
actually the same item but it would
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
affect multiple fund sources so that's
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
why I have it broken out that way what
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
the shading represents is uh an item
 
00:27:53.389 --> 00:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
that division two supported thank you
 
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
thank God
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
iosu uh and then as the budget work goes
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
through um let's use an example we don't
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
have Department of uh justice or what I
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to use a real department but
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
let's say someone wants to make a cut to
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
a department the Department's not going
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
to come in here and say can you please
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
cut our budget or so if there's any
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
change you want to make to the budget
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
that is not something discussed or
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
request you can ask me for an amendment
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
and then I can have some a piece of
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
paper drafted distributed to the
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
committee and I would add it to that as
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
a representative Earth you know
 
00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:29.519 align:start position:0%
Amendment or whatever just so if there's
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
something you want to bring for the
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
committee to consider I can add it to
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
that list as well so while you're on
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
that topic of amendments maybe we talk
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
about this I think you mentioned this to
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
me in our when we've met earlier
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
regarding amendments and I think you
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
indicated that and I just want to get
 
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
the committee to agree to this if if if
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
they agree that if we decide on
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
amendments you felt in the past it was
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay to vote without actually having the
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
physical Amendment from OS before us
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
first of all understand correctly you
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
what you said to me yep so in the past
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh if if the committee threw a work
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
session on a bill you know someone wants
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
to say oh support this but I'd want to
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
remove lines you know four and five we
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
can discuss that and I can tell the
 
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
committee I'll have that Amendment
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
drafted you can do a vote on that
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
pending versus recessing a work session
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
waiting for an amendment to be drafted
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
and then come back as long as the the
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
full committee is okay with that type of
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
action in the past it's worked for us
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
and that I'll just email the Amendment
 
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
to the full committee after the fact
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's just a more efficient way to
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
operate so I just like to make sure that
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're all on we're all on board with
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
that that's that's okay and there and
 
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you if there's one that I
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
think it would be more appropriate to
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
wait until something's drafted like if
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
it's you know if we want to off the top
 
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
of your head say seven different things
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
to this amendment I might say well
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
there's enough change there that let me
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
get something drafted and bring it back
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
but so yeah as long as we're all in
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
agreement then that's that's great yes
 
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative Muller papovich Muller
 
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
Mueller is fine to save time we don't
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
want to save papovich mu that off fun
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
but basically look there is also the
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
fact that in this committee we worked in
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
a very collegial Manner and if we have a
 
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
preliminary vote based on an amendment
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
and we agree to it and then the
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
amendment comes out and somebody feels
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
that they may want to reconsider we will
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
always be open to bringing back to the
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
table and retaking the vote or whatever
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
is needed to address those concerns but
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
having this process the way we had in
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
the past worked very well for us and I
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
would suggest we continue with you know
 
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
the accommodations that we'll make for
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
each other and and that's one other
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
thing to remember is nothing in this
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
committee is final everything here is
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
just a recommendation for a vote across
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
the hall so there will always be a
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
chance to fix something or to reconsider
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
even something we voted for here and
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
change your mind across the way that
 
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
point representative
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
Murray you'll learn I know eventually
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
I've been practicing home and not going
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
to believe but I've actually been going
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
to the going to the list and and I still
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
when I have to come up with I freeze so
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry go ahead not not a big deal um
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
wasn't the Department of Education
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
undergoing an audit and where are we on
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
that there was some issues of discussion
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
about the Department of Education and an
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
audit am I misremembering something or I
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
can speak to that if you want me to um I
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
assume you're referring to Performance
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
audits okay I'm on on the legislative
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
performance audit oversight committee um
 
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
I don't actually know if I'm still on it
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
but I've been on it at least initially
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
at least for these past few years there
 
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.870 align:start position:0%
at least for these past few years there
are

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
two um one related to special education
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
and one related to the um education
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts the special education
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
one I don't is not yet out but the work
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
is complete and they're in the final
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
phase of getting it out and the
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account one I believe
 
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.110 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account one I believe
we

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
just said yes go forward with with the
 
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
approved um scoping statement they Pro
 
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
provided last um in December so that's
 
00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:16.519 align:start position:0%
just essentially just beginning is is if
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
I recall correctly thank you if that
 
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.230 align:start position:0%
I recall correctly thank you if that
helps

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
y I don't have a whole lot else planned
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
but I'm glad to do I'm glad to do uh
 
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
just any open discussion anyone has this
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
that representative Kelly see she has an
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
remember um could I just ask for
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
clarification about how the education uh
 
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
funding committee the new committee how
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
those bills will mesh with Finance if it
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
will come to this division anything
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
and so will those bills all be first
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
committee bills and need to to go
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
through those deadlines so just because
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
there's a new committee doesn't mean
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
that this is the first time that funding
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
bills or or let me put it a different
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
way bills that are going to cost money
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
haven't gone through first committees um
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
so every bill that might eventually cost
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
money winds up is noted already as a
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
second committee bill because they have
 
00:33:26.669 --> 00:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
to finish that work up earlier those
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
committees do um and they come to us but
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
yes so in this case hopefully it's nice
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
that they have a separate committee pre
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
know proceeding
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
ours maybe we can get the bills into a
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
POS place where they'll more readily
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
move through Finance as opposed to what
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
has often times happened in the past and
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
probably will still happen with
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
especially with other committees is they
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
look at themselves as okay we're just a
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
policy committee we don't really care if
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost a bazillion dollars
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
um let's go for it it sounds like a
 
00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
great idea um I I think that's the
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
intent and as repres of while our
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
literat to this morning he's had
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
conversations with the various
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
committees to ask them to all take at
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
least some consideration of costs
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
associated with the bills that are
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
coming through their committees um in
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
their in their thinking does that does
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
that answer your question if not just
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
to I think so I'm trying to um mesh it
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
to how we always well yeah I know that
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
sitting in the audience I used to know
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
that you know things would go through uh
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
first committees but that they weren't
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
particular to one subject area
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
particularly but this new committee will
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
be dealing just with education funding
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering how that meshes with
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
this division oh but it's still first
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
committee second committee situation
 
00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
there'll be first committee bills um
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
just their focus will be on this on the
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
spending which is great but no it should
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
be the same process okay they'll go to
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
the first committee and then they'll
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
come to our committee and we can do
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
whatever we want with them just as we
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
have in the past
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
um The Hope in my mind I'm one of those
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
people and this is another one who's
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
sitting on that committee and I'm told
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
the reason we're doing this wasn't
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
exactly excited about it I'll admit that
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
um is that we hopefully can get the
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
bills and make so they'll flow more
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
readily when they come to this group
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
because um we've been we've been working
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
with them but yes they'll come here and
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
we can consider them just as we have in
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
the past all right that that answers my
 
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.589 align:start position:0%
the past all right that that answers my
question

00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
thank did did you have a question yeah
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
Mur yeah that's good no I knew the name
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
not well just I think you sort of
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
addressed it but just that the potential
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
exists that they the two the
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation coming from the policy
 
00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:41.079 align:start position:0%
committee will not mesh with the policy
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
in this committee that we still have to
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
do our own work on that and that um just
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
because they're recommending this
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we automatically agree
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
with that uh there may be conflict
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
between our focus on policy and what
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
their focus on policy is I expect that
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
may not be unreasonable or unlikely
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
no it's totally correct uh represent
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
meller thank you Mr chair I just wanted
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
to say two things one I am excited about
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
the double committee I'm a glutten for
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
punishment uh two I completely agree
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
with what representative Murray said
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
which is that while we will try to make
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
sure that the policy committee at least
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
that particular one does look at costs
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day because of both
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
the timing of the process and the nature
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee they do not have the
 
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
same view to the budget as a whole that
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
we have here so they may feel that taken
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
in isolation a policy makes sense but
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
then when we try to fit it into the
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
bigger puzzle it doesn't work so it
 
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
really doesn't change much I think the
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
one major beneficial impact besides the
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
whole workload thing for the education
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
committee is that hopefully we will get
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
fewer bills that will come directly to
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
us so they will act as the first
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
committee for all education funding
 
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
bills and then we'll be able to adjust
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
the finance committee we won't be asked
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
to worry about policy and finance at the
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
same time which has always been
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
difficult because that's not our core
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
job so the hope is that it will have
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
tell represent D you do you have any
 
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.309 align:start position:0%
tell represent D you do you have any
thoughts

00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
questions okay all right anyone else I I
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
was G to say I've not heard I've been
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
very quiet today so that's going to
 
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
change I guess here so so I just wanted
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
to say thank you in advance to Mr
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
landrian and his office for the guidance
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
and help that they're going to provide
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
us in the coming weeks and just to um
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
recognize and reflect that um it's been
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
a very um close workking relationship
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
with this committee and we're just so
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
thankful for um you know his
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
intelligence and his um patience
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes with us so thank you in
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
season representative Bean did you want
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
to add anything your all side
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
would said the same thing I I've enjoyed
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
working through so far and I'm looking
 
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
forward to uh a very close relationship
 
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.510 align:start position:0%
forward to uh a very close relationship
going

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
forward and I guess if there's nothing
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
else can we just one thing I was just
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
going to add I I forgot to say earlier
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
so I'll send you some links helpful
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
Links of some documents that are out
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
there you can familiarize yourself with
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
but also our our website too anything
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
that I hand out here I'm going to post
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
online to a separate division 2 page so
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh do you all know where that is yeah I
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
I'll send that link to everyone uh um so
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
anything that is handed out here uh
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have it online I'm also going to
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
try to make an effort to get documents
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
from agencies in advance of our meetings
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
and I will email them and post them
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
online the day of I'll I'll try to email
 
00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:46.839 align:start position:0%
them to you the night before at least
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
and then I'll post them online ahead of
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
our meeting so that way maybe you could
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
familiarize yourself with the documents
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
so when you're hearing from the agency
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
or not seeing this stuff reading it for
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
the first time as they're testifying and
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully that that's been helpful in
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
the past and hopefully that'll be
 
00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
helpful again this year and I'll just
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
add I'm the pain in the neck that
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
insists on this um I really can't work
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
with paper um so I do really want all
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
the people that come before us to
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
provide their documentation hopefully
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
the night before or at least the day
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
before um but at the very least before
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
the meeting because I only work off of
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
um the screen so not that you have to
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
work that way but it's given telling you
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
how I how I
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
operate and there will be a lot of paper
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
for those of you who do work call
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
especially in this committee I brought
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
this as a prop you all remember the Ed
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
funding spreadsheets we'll have a bunch
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
of those flying around at some point as
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
well um but yeah I'm I'm looking forward
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
well anything else for the good of the
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee as my former chairman Edwards
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
would always
 
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
ask everybody good all right I'll
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
meeting adjourned at
 
00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.870 align:start position:0%
meeting adjourned at
uh

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:56.230 align:start position:0%
 
than

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
