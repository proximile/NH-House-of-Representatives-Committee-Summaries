I thank you very much for having us back
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
this morning uh as a reminder I'm Jim
 
00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:17.339 align:start position:0%
Dean president of unh and interim
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
Chancellor of usnh and this is Kathy
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
provencher who am I think you all know
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
our Chief Financial Officer and chief
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
administrative officer for the system uh
 
00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:28.019 align:start position:0%
I know you're looking to wrap up today
 
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
so we'll try to be brief okay first I
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
understand that you voted yesterday to
 
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
fund the governor's recommendation for
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
the interoperability lab in the
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
blockchain quality assurance project and
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
we thank you for that as you've heard
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
that seed project will allow us to stand
 
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
up a crucial new function in a growing
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
business sector that will serve our
 
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
state and our business Community well
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
uh importantly I expect it will also be
 
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
a critical Workforce pipeline into that
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
emerging industry so thank you again for
 
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.430 align:start position:0%
emerging industry so thank you again for
that

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
um there are then two outstanding items
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the university system the
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
five million dollar differential between
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
our budget request and the governor's
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
proposal in fiscal 25 and then the
 
00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459 align:start position:0%
spending from Surplus for the Whitmore
 
00:13:08.459 --> 00:13:09.350 align:start position:0%
spending from Surplus for the Whitmore
Center

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
Center
 
00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:11.579 align:start position:0%
we understand this is pencil sharpening
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
time for you I don't know if you all
 
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
actually use pencils that's a figure so
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
you do actually
 
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:20.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not the pencil it's the Eraser
 
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
that's important right this time of year
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
fair enough we know that feeling after
 
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing for the last
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
several years at the University and I
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
wanted to share just a couple thoughts
 
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:35.700 align:start position:0%
that might be helpful first relative to
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
the black Grant request we believe that
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
with an additional two million dollars
 
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 25 a week in guarantee today
 
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
that we can keep tuition Frozen for
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
in-state students through fiscal 26. so
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
that would be flat tuition for six years
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
and counting for inflation and and I
 
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
want to say this really carefully
 
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
because it's not a cut it's a 14
 
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
difference between what tuition would be
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
if we kept up with inflation versus what
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
we would actually be charging by keeping
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
tuition flat for that period of time and
 
00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
that would be so the governor uh cut
 
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
five million dollars from what we had
 
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
requested and were asking to restore to
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
and with that two million dollars we can
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
guarantee two more years of flat tuition
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
for in-state students which would I
 
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
think be very helpful for them and and
 
00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:23.579 align:start position:0%
actually we're starting to see the
 
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
results already from having kept tuition
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
flat first for several years already
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
other states and state universities have
 
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
continued to raise their rates ours are
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
staying flat and so that's helping us
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
competitively to keep more students in
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which you'll remember from
 
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
our previous talk is really what this is
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
all about uh what would we give up on
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
sacrificing the additional three million
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
dollars some additional Partnerships uh
 
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
additional positions relative to our
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
Business Partnership work these are
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
important but we'll figure it out
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
somehow how to get that done but the the
 
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
additional two million dollars would
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
help us really substantially in terms of
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
tuition and I don't know that we've ever
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
in the history been able to keep tuition
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
flat for this long especially in an
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
inflationary environment so it's
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
something we're really committed to and
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your partnership in
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
helping us to do that
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
second topic then is the Whittemore
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
Center and as we mentioned uh when we
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
were here before for the project to move
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
forward we do need a one-time investment
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
from the state as you know this is one
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
of the largest venues in New Hampshire
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
and it's really a state asset as we saw
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic when we were proud
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
to host this this very body in the
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
whittlemore center so it's great that
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
you've all or at least if you were in
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
office then have all been there
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
um this item has been framed around UNH
 
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
men's and women's hockey and certainly
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
they would be the beneficiaries but I
 
00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:47.339 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know that there's
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
certainly other groups uh who use the
 
00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:50.779 align:start position:0%
Woodmore Center
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
one is high school teams and so we host
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
the high school championship for hockey
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
and the whittlemore center and so that's
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
important to them there's not that many
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
places that could host them and then
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
also I'm not sure how familiar you are
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
with Northeast passage which is our
 
00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
adaptive Sports organization that's part
 
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:10.220 align:start position:0%
of unh
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
and our sled hockey team which
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
represents New Hampshire actually has
 
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
been enormously successful we've sent
 
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
athletes to the Paralympics virtually
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
every time that they've been there we've
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
won a few times and part of the project
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
would actually be to allow people who
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
have certain handicaps to be able to
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
participate in hockey and play in the
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
Whitmore as well so that's something
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
that we're really committed to so as you
 
00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:35.339 align:start position:0%
know it's a 30 million dollar project
 
00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:38.339 align:start position:0%
UNH has already begun investing and we
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
have a number of private donors lined up
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
to support but basically they have told
 
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:44.579 align:start position:0%
us unless there's some State support
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to be able to do
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
this because we can't UNH can't cover
 
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
the difference so we had requested uh
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars and the governor
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
put eight million dollars in his budget
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh again back to the sharpening the
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
pencils and the and the erasers we think
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
that with a six million dollar
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
investment we can still hold on to the
 
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
donors uh that we will be able to figure
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
out the additional two million dollars
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to raise their
 
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.949 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to raise their
commitment

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
um and we'll be able to get the project
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
done what will we give up to go from
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars to six million
 
00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:18.059 align:start position:0%
dollars basically nothing other than we
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
would be asking donors to come up with
 
00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:21.419 align:start position:0%
the additional two million dollars and
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to complete the
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
project as anticipated
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
so thank you once again for listening
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for having us back I know that
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
I can feel it actually it's the first
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
time I've been here on this part of the
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
season I can feel the uh Edge for lack
 
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:37.820 align:start position:0%
of a better word that's a good word
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
and so uh for you to give us an
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk with you again about
 
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
our needs we really really do appreciate
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
and we would be happy to answer any
 
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
questions for them yes Mr chair
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
um in light of the time and the day I
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
would like to make a motion that we um
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
accept the request for two million
 
00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
dollars and we also approve the request
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
for six million dollars for the
 
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539 align:start position:0%
Whittemore Center I had a lengthy
 
00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:06.299 align:start position:0%
conversation last night with um my Kiki
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he's a trustee or one of
 
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
your people
 
00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:12.020 align:start position:0%
um and he talked about the importance of
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
that the state providing some kind of a
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
match so that people see that the state
 
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
is investing in this that in that manner
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
they can really go out and obtain more
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
funding so I think it's really important
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
we haven't always been good to UNH and I
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
think this is an opportunity to do that
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
and I would like to make that motion
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
so the comment
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
just a quick comment um
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
at this point in time I'm uh willing to
 
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
approve the two but not the six if the
 
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
motion is made on both of them I'm gonna
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
have to say no on both of them I would
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate if the motion would be split
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
so I can vote accordingly also depending
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
on how things are developing through the
 
00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
end of the day and where other funds can
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
be found I'm not ruling out the six but
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
right now at this point of the day I
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
could not approve it and
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'll divide motion okay so this
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
is just on the six but the million for
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
the two million
 
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
um as requested to keep tuition down and
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
then the Six Million for the Whittemore
 
00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:20.870 align:start position:0%
then the Six Million for the Whittemore
Center

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
Center
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
two motions two motions
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
for the Six Million for Whitmore Center
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
now the two million now the two million
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
that we didn't spend in the Whittemore
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
Center and we're going to allocate
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
good pencil sharpening
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
you have a second for that motion okay
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
okay eight to zip those two go through
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
now we had some other items and I'm
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused when we got onto
 
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
page three
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
there was a couple of items here having
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.789 align:start position:0%
to do with
um

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
I think that was the two million that
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
was the two million okay okay
 
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.909 align:start position:0%
was the two million okay okay
good

00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to say uh thank you very
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
much for the support division two we'll
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
have immense impact on the University
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
system if it makes its way through the
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
process thank you and your alumni are
 
00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
strong and calling
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
because I got a call last night from a
 
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
gentleman class of 73. you know
 
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.909 align:start position:0%
gentleman class of 73. you know
good

00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
thank you all very much we appreciate it
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
we know you're busy thank you who was
 
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:54.299 align:start position:0%
the other no vote on the uh
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:23.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
no we just gave them back
 
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.789 align:start position:0%
no we just gave them back
yeah

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
that's right I guess I guess after two
 
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:50.169 align:start position:0%
that's right I guess I guess after two
minutes

00:21:50.169 --> 00:21:50.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um could I ask Mickey
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
to update us given the two recent votes
 
00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:00.059 align:start position:0%
where we are in terms of uh bottom line
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
because yesterday for every item that we
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
approved we were trying to find matching
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
savings and right now we uh just
 
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
approved 8 million and I would like to
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
see where the
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
Source you know where we are on the
 
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
bottom line and then decide what action
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
may be needed so since that eight was
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
already accounted for since it was in in
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget that came we
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
essentially repurposed two of that so
 
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's a net zero those actions you just
 
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
if I may ask Nikki uh now this
 
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
possible we took was on the uh Plymouth
 
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
State and King state
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
the instead of five we're doing two
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
million correct so that would be the
 
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
line 53 on your document there okay
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
we have a an amendment uh 150 000 for
 
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:15.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.169 --> 00:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
unfunded but now it's Sunday with two
 
00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:19.250 align:start position:0%
unfunded but now it's Sunday with two
million

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
oh but that's that's this last that's 53
 
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:36.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.289 --> 00:23:41.299 align:start position:0%
that's section 89 on front page
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's already in that is the government
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
is there someone here that can explain
 
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.490 align:start position:0%
is there someone here that can explain
this

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
I'm on it but I I know I'm surprised to
 
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
see my name on it
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%

there's

00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.310 align:start position:0%
marketing materials here
um

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like it's a big data
 
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
analysis tool
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
for who yes we should wait for the
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
department but I believe many years ago
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
we used to have this and there was a
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
issue with relation to the data
 
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
requested to do the matches
 
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
um that we ended up not being able to
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
fund it anymore so
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's good information because you can
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
get longitudinal information for
 
00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
children coming all through the system
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
into college
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
um that's my experience with it
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
um from a long long time ago but the we
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
really need to hear from the Department
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
about what they want to do now and how
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to uh what kind
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
of data they're going to need to use in
 
00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:00.539 align:start position:0%
order to make the match
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
well hopefully
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
we'll get somebody
 
00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:06.539 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it sounds like it collects
 
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
information regarding questions that
 
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
we've asked in the past and the answer
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
has been well we don't collect that data
 
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
in terms of college enrollments in
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
majors and how our students percentage
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
of students that graduate here compared
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
to other places vocational training here
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
compared to other places uh Trends and
 
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
what kids are majoring in we've often
 
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
had those kinds of questions and the
 
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
answer has been I don't know
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
so this says available to the school
 
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.990 align:start position:0%
so this says available to the school
districts

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
each Public School District anyway
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:58.730 align:start position:0%
 
probably

00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.370 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:00.380 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
well let's see if we can get somebody
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education it
 
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
you have you have knowledge we have
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.649 --> 00:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
um hi I'm Shannon Reed with the
 
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
community college system I I'm not
 
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
familiar with the amendment what it does
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
that isn't currently being done but we
 
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
do subscribe to it we use the
 
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse to track
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
um to help us understand the flow of
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
students into and out of our
 
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.950 align:start position:0%
students into and out of our
institutions

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.450 align:start position:0%
institutions
okay

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
this website is also
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
helps determine a student's financial
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
needs so it makes me believe that there
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
are certain demographic data points for
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status that would be
 
00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:55.370 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status that would be
helpful

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
for you know determining connection
 
00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:03.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid I can't I can't answer that
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
that's not something that I get involved
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
in personally
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative Hill do you have more
 
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
knowledge on this
 
00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
we exhausted my knowledge set very
 
00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:20.450 align:start position:0%
we exhausted my knowledge set very
quickly

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.090 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
um

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the uh Greg Hill
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
from uh Northfield remember Mac II uh
 
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
catching my breath
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
um we're here talking about the national
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
student tracker
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
so this is a system that uh
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
seems to be
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
well known in some circles and others
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
not the doe does participate already
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
with student tracker
 
00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:54.059 align:start position:0%
um 38 cities and towns or school
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
districts in New Hampshire already
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
participate with student tracker
 
00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
this is just simply a bill to to allow
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
the doe to pay for all districts to have
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
student tracker and and I would assume
 
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
if they want it but it is a um a
 
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
recognized tracking system my own school
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
district is how I learned about it
 
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.110 align:start position:0%
district is how I learned about it
um

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
I I had heard about this at a conference
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
came back to talk to my own school board
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
and they said
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
um we've never heard of anything the
 
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
superintendent said wait a minute I
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
think I pay for that so
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
um it's it was at that time it was four
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and they they have
 
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
always had the the difficulty or the
 
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
problem or the
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
the desire to be able to learn what
 
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
their students do after they graduate
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
and they said the only way that they
 
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
were doing it previously was
 
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
um waiting for students to come back
 
00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:03.059 align:start position:0%
after college and and talk to them and
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
it was a very imprecise system so when
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
we discovered that we had this and we're
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
already paying for it
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
um the school board started pulling it
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
apart and finding out that um it's an
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
extremely valuable tool for them to be
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
able to find out how successful their
 
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
students are after they leave the
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
confines of their high school with their
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.179 --> 00:31:35.450 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
how do you do thank you and thank you
 
00:31:39.649 --> 00:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
um how do you match the data do you use
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
the data the school district has an i-4c
 
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.409 align:start position:0%
the data the school district has an i-4c
um

00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
you've gone over my ability to know
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
about it um it I do know that all of the
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
literature which I have and I can
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
certainly make copies for you all
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
um I had come prepared today to to speak
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
um but not with copies
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
um but it is
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
um it it speaks in their literature to
 
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.419 align:start position:0%
being FERPA compliant it speaks to all
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
of the student privacy issues that deal
 
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
with it and again as I say 38 cities and
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
towns currently using I just don't know
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
which ones they were because they
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even tell me which ones are
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
using it so that's how how far I I can
 
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.909 align:start position:0%
using it so that's how how far I I can
go

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
but it does it does a number of things I
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
think my district has found different
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
ways to use it every year
 
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
um they're they're looking for Best
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
Practices they're and and that's the
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
hope when we do all districts that will
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
find data that now lets us see where
 
00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
block scheduling works or something else
 
00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:51.500 align:start position:0%
you know along those lines
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
it seems a very reasonable price to me
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
to get this level of data from an
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
organization that's been doing it since
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
reading the language of the amendment
 
00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:09.380 align:start position:0%
does not make it clear to me whether
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
obviously we are paying for it but it's
 
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
not clear to me this requires the school
 
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
districts to participate or just gives
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
them the option to participate I would
 
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
strongly support the second choice I
 
00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily support the first
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
so my understanding when I we had this
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
discussion on a very limited basis my
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is this is the latter that
 
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
um that that amount of money is
 
00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:39.260 align:start position:0%
sufficient for all districts to
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
participate and and I would add if they
 
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why a district wouldn't
 
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
but because of I know I know but it is a
 
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
it it was important to me that this not
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
be a 28a issue and it was important to
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
me to make this as an opportunity that's
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
available to school districts
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
yep everybody thank you and thanks for
 
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:09.419 align:start position:0%
the explanation
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like it's very valuable
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
information from hearing from you and
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
from Shannon from representative Heath
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
and it seems like it goes to answer some
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
of the questions that we've had on
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
occasion about school so uh presume all
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
the school districts buy into this they
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
use this program how does that that
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
aggregate information get to the
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
legislature to answer the questions that
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
we have will there be a way of is there
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
a will the Department of Education for
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
instance collect this information put it
 
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
into an aggregate so when we ask about
 
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
this question of these students you know
 
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
going here or going there that we get an
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
answer because I fully support all the
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
school districts having this information
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice in making some of our
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
decisions if we had a gag or get
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
information across the state
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question I'm not
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
sure I could um agree with you more
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
um I think that that because doe already
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
has a relationship with this
 
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
organization that's how we get our state
 
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.270 align:start position:0%
organization that's how we get our state
data

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
um I would believe that there would be a
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
on high platform or something like that
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
that um that there would be a way of of
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
accessing all of it but but I I can't
 
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.670 align:start position:0%
accessing all of it but but I I can't
get

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
into the technical weeds of how that
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
would occur I don't know
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
my question I'm just reading the first
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
line of the amendment and I am wondering
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
if I'm correct in assuming that this
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
would be a one-time draw of a hundred
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
and fifty thousand from the Surplus and
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund uh for June
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
30th 2023. does that sound correct
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
I um I do have information uh that I
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
pulled off the website I'm not sure if
 
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
that's helpful or not it does talk to
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
their privacy commitment on the first so
 
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
what what organizations they utilize for
 
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
that it talks about and that's the
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
record-keeping safety for it's called
 
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
the I keep safe FERPA badge
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
um then there's another system that
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
talks about why student tracker should
 
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
be put into every system and what
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
information can be generated from it
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
um so all of these things I'm happy to
 
00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:27.980 align:start position:0%
make available to you
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
in copies
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
um or just leave the package and and
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
Mickey can do what he wants to do with
 
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.470 align:start position:0%
Mickey can do what he wants to do with
it

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
thank you and sorry but I just get
 
00:36:38.339 --> 00:36:39.290 align:start position:0%
thank you and sorry but I just get
curious

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
curious
 
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
um we've had you know obviously we all
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
know the difficulty of people turning in
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
forms around free and reduced lunch and
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff how do how does
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
this organization how do the school
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
district provide the economic
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
information around scholarships that um
 
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
representative Higgin Phillips was
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
reading about when she was reading the
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
blurb on the organization
 
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.410 align:start position:0%
blurb on the organization
um

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
it's a really good question
 
00:37:02.339 --> 00:37:03.109 align:start position:0%
it's a really good question
um

00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:06.980 align:start position:0%
all I can say and and again I'll
 
00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:10.460 align:start position:0%
reiterate that 38 schools are doing this
 
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:13.460 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire within our
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations on privacy
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that
 
00:37:19.079 --> 00:37:19.670 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that
um

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
because on the website they're not
 
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
they're very careful to not State
 
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
exactly what they do
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
because they I believe work in
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
conjunction with our state laws on
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
privacy so I think each program is
 
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.170 align:start position:0%
privacy so I think each program is
individually

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:38.180 align:start position:0%
individually
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
based on the state regulations in that
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
particular state that they do so I'm not
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
sure I can answer how it's done but I
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
would assume because we have 38 cities
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh school districts currently using it
 
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
that that it's handled I I just don't
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
know how yeah thank you I'm just asking
 
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
again we're all searching around for
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
better ways of identifying students uh
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch and for you
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
know those kinds of programs so I was
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
curious thank you yeah I'm I'm not sure
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
this is your solution but
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh thank you for taking my
 
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:20.099 align:start position:0%
question certainly and the first
 
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
sentence says that this is for fiscal
 
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
year ending June 30th 2023 which is this
 
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.370 align:start position:0%
year ending June 30th 2023 which is this
year

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
so so this appropriation is a draw
 
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
against the 23 Surplus and then it
 
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
you'll notice on line uh five to six the
 
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
appropriation is non-lapsing so it would
 
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
be available to spend in the next
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
biennium thank you
 
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
I don't want to vote on this yet yeah
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'll just come up here with Greg
 
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.349 align:start position:0%
I'll just come up here with Greg
um

00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
Rick Ladd Haverhill New Hampshire I just
 
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
had a talk with Diana Fenton from the uh
 
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
doe she's the attorney for doe also with
 
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
the commissioner on the phone not more
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
and and Greg was there about five
 
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
minutes ago this data also explains uh
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
low poverty type schools uh and provides
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
aggregate information it's required on
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
federal applications
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh so this is something they have been
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
doing it's nothing really new but it's
 
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
uh it's required and on these Federal
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
applications where you're going after
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
this money to be able to give this
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
aggregate information about uh cultures
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
when you're in schools uh poverty levels
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
within your schools uh we see it also on
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
graduation rates we see it in regard to
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
whether you complete College in four or
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
six years this is information we use in
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
determining and looking at when we look
 
00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
at oversight of all this in higher
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
education and within our our K-12 that
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
is valuable and needed and we get it
 
00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
through doe and the national
 
00:39:59.089 --> 00:39:59.099 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse has been doing this for
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
years and they have this all available
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
on aggregate but this is what we have to
 
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
do as paying the access that information
 
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.190 align:start position:0%
do as paying the access that information
question

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
honestly at this point I feel that
 
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
emotion to approve the amendment would
 
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
I'm fine waiting
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
I think we've got some of the budget
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
discussions to have
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
and I will wait no I think we're all in
 
00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:28.619 align:start position:0%
agreement this is a good idea if we just
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
find out what the data matches how we
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
we match the student to the information
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you that representative I
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
can't explain that because is it the
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
facet I have worked with the for example
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
the president up at PSU prior to uh don
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
being there and Sarah uh when she was
 
00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
there and um they use it actively on
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
that level but we also use it with our
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
high schools and our counselors use this
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
information as well and it's nothing new
 
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's something we have been doing but I
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't know where the Commissioners come
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
up with those resources I know that even
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
Virginia Berry was using this
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
information right here's dating back
 
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:11.990 align:start position:0%
information right here's dating back
right

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
I remember it well yeah
 
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
yeah but we don't know that we don't
 
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
know the connect the technical
 
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
connection I don't know I don't know it
 
00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.109 align:start position:0%
connection I don't know I don't know it
either

00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:23.420 align:start position:0%
that's beyond our pay grade
 
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:26.060 align:start position:0%
most everything is
 
00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay thank you very much
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
you're welcome all right thank you I'm
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
going to pass out the other the uh
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
building Aid
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
so we can get some discussion going on
 
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
that is in your packet so if you go to
 
00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.589 align:start position:0%
that is in your packet so if you go to
page

00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
28 you'll see a revised version of the
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative whole Amendment relative
 
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
to his proposal for school building Aid
 
00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.210 align:start position:0%
to his proposal for school building Aid
okay

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
what what this what this version does is
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
incorporates the uh the discussion we
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
had about what is capital
 
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
this also has an effective date of
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2025.
 
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
so my thought on this is to
 
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
hopefully move this forward not at this
 
00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
time but in a little while
 
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
but there will be plenty of time to work
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
on it before it goes into effect because
 
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
I I think if we're going to do something
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
like this it still needs to have
 
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
weighted for the school districts that
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
have greater needs than the ones that
 
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:35.990 align:start position:0%
have greater needs than the ones that
don't

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
so we'll call that the 529 effect
 
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.930 align:start position:0%
so we'll call that the 529 effect
uh

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
that I I think that this needs to be
 
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
right revised with that but I'm still
 
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
to put on notice that an approach like
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
this is coming down the pipe and we've
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
got a year and a half to work on it
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
and I've solicit comments
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
um I would like to hear from Amy have
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
no it's just clarification of and and
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
the ADM a
 
00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.770 align:start position:0%
the ADM a
um

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:26.870 align:start position:0%
um
admr

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
looks like the same values are allocated
 
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
for admr and adma as previously
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
presented right
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
so I don't think our timeline if that's
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
correct I don't think the timeline
 
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
changes for you know
 
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
building a to accumulate in these
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
potential Capital reserves over time at
 
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
a local District level I think Amy's
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
assessment of the timeline has not
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
changed is is my understanding
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
so Amy Clark Department of Education
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
um correct if there's nothing different
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
from the previous amendment I guess I
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
don't have anything other AD other than
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
I would I would say the same thing all
 
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:05.579 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
00:44:05.579 --> 00:44:07.130 align:start position:0%
right thank you
yes

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
yeah other than you know these the the
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
two changes of the time and then the
 
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
line what 25 here
 
00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
I don't see that this is any different
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
from what we had before and as I had
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
said before I have no problem examining
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
a different you know new models new ways
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
of looking at things but I think we had
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of evidence from Ms Clark and from
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd that this isn't it
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
where it's going to be in one scenario
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
106 years or 160 years before now we're
 
00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
talking about great grandchildren
 
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
benefiting by this and not the children
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
I think that I heard a lot to say that
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
this is not going to work and so I
 
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
cannot support it even with the minor
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
chain I think it is a rather minor
 
00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
change in in the amendment but I am open
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
to having some sort of a group going
 
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
forward and I as I recall too as I say
 
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.010 align:start position:0%
forward and I as I recall too as I say
that

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
um the education committee is working on
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
this and they have the knowledge the
 
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
experience they have access to the
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
experts who can provide them with
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
information they have the time to put
 
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
together some sort of a schedule and
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
spread this out to see how best it would
 
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
work but there's not enough change here
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
at all for me to consider supporting it
 
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
I support anything to you know I'm
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
looking to do something better I'm
 
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
always there's always a better way I
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
don't see that this is it and I cannot
 
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
support this I support the education
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
committee doing their job since this is
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
their job
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay other comments
 
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
just a non-starter for us and it will be
 
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.150 align:start position:0%
just a non-starter for us and it will be
um

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.650 align:start position:0%
um
impossible

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
for us to bring this forward to our
 
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.130 align:start position:0%
for us to bring this forward to our
caucus

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
I just I can't see
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
um any number of
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
um our side looking at this with any
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
form of favor and in all honesty I think
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
even among your ranks um people who have
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
used and are hoping to get building Aid
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
will be very disappointed to see a
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
proposal coming forward like this
 
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
because just it's not a realistic
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
proposal for building Aid and people
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
have it's been 10 years of a moratorium
 
00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:11.579 align:start position:0%
it's been 10 years that they haven't
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
been able to access I don't can't even
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
begin to tell you how many emails I get
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
every single day
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to building Aid and please
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
invest in building Aid and this for me
 
00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
is not an investment in building Aid
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
the the intention here is to give all
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
school districts something
 
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
because right now we have a list with 17
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
who have gone through the Hoops uh to to
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
apply and we're and and of the 17-3 are
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
being funded
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
seems it seems like a
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of effort for three three
 
00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
school districts yes and the way I was
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
reading this and I'm kicking myself that
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
I don't have representative Ladd's
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
little chart here but it almost looks
 
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
like it would take 38 years for one
 
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
school to be able to repair a couple
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
windows and that does nothing for
 
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
building Aid
 
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
well take take your own School District
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
how many students do you have multiply
 
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
it out it was 300 K through 8 and 350
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
High School what does it work out to
 
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
following our discussion on this the
 
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
other day I went and refined some of
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
those figures
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
um and there there are some huge if
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
issues here in regard to process
 
00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
first of all this is an issue which
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
we've all always considered within house
 
00:48:04.609 --> 00:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
policy education policy as one of the
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
top two or three issues which we have to
 
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
deal with which requires hearing process
 
00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
and it really does uh need to have a
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
careful study done not something that's
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
done on a two or three page Amendment or
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
a bill now on what's being passed out I
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
like to go to the back side of this
 
00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
now we have a bill which we have
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
retained for this exact purpose and that
 
00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:34.619 align:start position:0%
will start immediately but you can see
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
where it says study methods of ensuring
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
long-term sustainability funding for
 
00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
school buildings and identify source of
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
such funds
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
we recognize the need here but to look
 
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
at the whole Amendment right now
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
as you imagine represent emmerich
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
there's no waiting at all of of the
 
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
these dollars which go out and certainly
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
the way we have it right now we have it
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
weighted 30 percent 25 or 30 35 up to 60
 
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be in terms of medium
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
family income and poverty within the
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
district this other formula does not
 
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
have that at all and you can see on the
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
last figure there for this school that's
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
250 kids so the square footage would be
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
120 square feet per kid up to 144
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
there's an exception which slides
 
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
further I took the lesser of the two and
 
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
you can see the cost that building would
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
be 8.8 million dollars
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
if in fact we are dealing with a poverty
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
district and doing it the way it's said
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
within that bill at three hundred
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
dollars per pupil it would take 70.8
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
years for them to Garner the money to do
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
this do the project 70 years that means
 
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
your grandkids are going to see it
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
before you're going to see it
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
um not you you know I if I were a kid to
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
be the grandparents kids of that of that
 
00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:02.339 align:start position:0%
so there's there's some real questions
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
here there's also the questions that we
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
have many districts that don't even have
 
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
high schools
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
and are they going to receive the
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
funding for that we have districts who
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
are sending to another state are they
 
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
good how how is that going to be handled
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
there are but the concept is a concept
 
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
which needs to be discussed it needs to
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
be brainstormed it needs to be worked
 
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
with the other Concepts we have out
 
00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:26.339 align:start position:0%
there available to school building a
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
and so I would encourage you not to push
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
the policy committee aside which has
 
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
that responsibility that is our job it's
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
not that of an amendment that comes in
 
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
this process I'll be frank
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
if an amendment like this or a bill like
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
this comes in there will be Republicans
 
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
to vote against the bill in total I
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
being one
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
so this is such a critical issue in our
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
state I value how we fund that education
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
the adequacy which you're also
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
struggling with
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
building Aid and Career Technical
 
00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.250 align:start position:0%
building Aid and Career Technical
education

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
those are areas which are key to our
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
future for our Workforce this is
 
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
critical for that as well and so please
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
don't do something rash work with the
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
policy committee we I could have that
 
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
committee up and going and working
 
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
seeing we've retain that bill and yes
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
they won't don't want us to start re
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
discussing retain bills but I've always
 
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
worked with leadership with the clerk
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
would the speaker and had an exception
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
of that policy when we have a critical
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
issue we can start that study
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
immediately and we should because we
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
need to have a lot of research got
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
gathered here as we I've already have
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
the research assistant doing upstairs
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
and looking at this very formula that
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
you're talking about that Kentucky and
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
Virginia do do
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
but it's a whole lot different than just
 
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
two or three pages of an amendment here
 
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
so please slow this ship down a little
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
bit it's it's not a bad idea but it
 
00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
needs a lot more work thank you okay
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Mr chair I would like
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
to make a motion that we refer this
 
00:52:02.569 --> 00:52:02.579 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:11.300 align:start position:0%
reduce that kind of thing
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
no I think it's that's up to this I
 
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
think we can you can take a motion to
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know formally itl if you want this
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
amendment as far as the work that's
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
referred to education committee you and
 
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
chair lad can work that out I would
 
00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:26.579 align:start position:0%
encourage folks that are on finance
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
division two or Finance or those which
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
involved even for example like a Greg
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
Hill who is chairing the school building
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
authority to participate with House Ed
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
to get us down the path we need to get
 
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
down and get some resolution we could
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
probably have that resolution done by
 
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.150 align:start position:0%
probably have that resolution done by
fall

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.230 align:start position:0%
fall
yes

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:52:48.049 --> 00:52:48.059 align:start position:0%
great uh thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening uh we've been
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
kicking this can down the road for as
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
long as I've known you
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
this has been a tough especially during
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
the moratorium and right now we've got
 
00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:00.059 align:start position:0%
three districts they're probably going
 
00:53:02.089 --> 00:53:02.099 align:start position:0%
to get money even with this amendment
 
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
and we just keep kicking that can down
 
00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:06.059 align:start position:0%
the road and we got to fix this I mean
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
and and it if you can uh I you know I'd
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
be willing to go along with what you're
 
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.329 align:start position:0%
be willing to go along with what you're
saying

00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
with uh you know referring well not
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily referring but you're going
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
to work you've got a study committee
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to work on this let me just
 
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
say one thing uh represent Petrie that
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
it's not like it's been out of our
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
headlights at all we're not trying to
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
kick this can down the road we have been
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
trying to work at that we've presented
 
00:53:33.549 --> 00:53:33.559 align:start position:0%
bill after Bill after Bill to try to
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
find a way towards the end that you're
 
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:38.099 align:start position:0%
trying to get us towards remember the
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
bill where we were looking for the
 
00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
survey of all our schools out there so
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
we could find out what we had in terms
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
of condition assessment that would have
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
cost 3.3 million dollars we've had bills
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
come forward in terms of putting the in
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
fact there is one that's came forward
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
this year where to fund School building
 
00:53:59.410 --> 00:53:59.420 align:start position:0%
Aid we would have 50.50 million dollars
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
on top of the debt for each year of the
 
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.089 align:start position:0%
on top of the debt for each year of the
biennium

00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:05.099 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that that's close to
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
where the governor is where the 75.
 
00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:12.059 align:start position:0%
um that would help but I'm not here to
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
justify why you know Concord is not in
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
it or litchfield's not in it uh this
 
00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
year's allocation I would like to see
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
them be involved however I'm here to try
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
and communicate that we see that there's
 
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
we see that there's a need to clean this
 
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
up and we want to move forward and we
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
are moving forward
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
um I I think this commitment on the
 
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
whole uh House and Senate now to do that
 
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
so this is the time it has to be done
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
let's do it correctly please
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
well right uh this survey I mean it's
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know some districts want to Taj
 
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
Mahal others want full walls for
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
education and that's you know and we we
 
00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
should get out of that business I mean
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
it's not up to the state to dictate what
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
kind of building you're going to have
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
right now you can put a theater and I
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
had a theater up in Alaska where we had
 
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
600 people at casino looked like you
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
were in London watching a play law uh
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
and however and we had an orchestra pit
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
and 52 drops on stage but that was paid
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
well beyond
 
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
what we allocated within that Borough
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
Amy's policies that she has right now
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
has a minimum this is what we as a state
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
pay for if you want to have that theater
 
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
in your school that's on you Mr District
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
you do it and and you go beyond that's
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
you have our blessing but you fund it so
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
um we do have restrictions right now in
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
current law the problem we have is
 
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
the problem that we're experiencing
 
00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:48.140 align:start position:0%
right now since we come out of the the
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
moratorium three buildings we know we
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
have a huge number a list with huge
 
00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
dollars how do we address that how do we
 
00:55:58.609 --> 00:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
address the fact that some schools have
 
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:01.140 align:start position:0%
just received building Aid are they
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to be treated the same way as
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
those that have not yet received
 
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
building a we have what how many seven
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
Amy or so that have received it since
 
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
the moratorium maybe more adding this on
 
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
are they going to be in the same pot
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
um that we have some buildings which are
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
newer than others is that going to be
 
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
considered uh all this we need that's
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
what policy's for well the question you
 
00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:26.420 align:start position:0%
ask if I mean
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
part of this this amendment is debt
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
serves which which helps pay for the
 
00:56:31.559 --> 00:56:32.450 align:start position:0%
serves which which helps pay for the
bond

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
bond
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
and and it helps pay for the ones that
 
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
are out there that that didn't get any
 
00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
building Aid
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
and we want to look at that as one of
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
the options here
 
00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
are we going to have the debt service
 
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
over the period paying back that Bond
 
00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
over the period of the longevity of that
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
loan or are we going to put 80 up front
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
we we see that as something has to
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
discussed but we want to go well beyond
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
that we want to go into the domain that
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
we have represent holes we want to see
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
if there are there are other ways of
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
treating this and doing this so that we
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
can get on with school building support
 
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
I can tell you one thing though it's
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
going to cost dollars and you know that
 
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
and it's going to have to be a higher
 
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:14.780 align:start position:0%
commitment from the state to allocate
 
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
and we we've recognized that already in
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
policy that's why we have put four
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
forward unanimously down below each year
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
to fund 50 million dollars excluding the
 
00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:28.970 align:start position:0%
to fund 50 million dollars excluding the
debt

00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
debt
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
and remember that debt that tail is
 
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
going to shrink off very rapidly here in
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
another three years
 
00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
and you're going to see that there's
 
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
going to be more money available and
 
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
with that there will be more acceptance
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
of these projects which are coming
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
forward to Amy right follow-up uh I
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
think that you know we that's one of the
 
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
problems that I see is that we have to
 
00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
fund it at a level where it's 12 years
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
of education or or whatever the building
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
life is
 
00:57:58.790 --> 00:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know because if we don't do that
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
then you know then you fall behind every
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
year I mean you you get further and
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
further behind it takes you 130 years to
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
pay I mean I I get that but that means
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
we have to fund it at a higher level
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
I mean that plenty is simple
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you yeah this is a seismic
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
policy shift and
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
um I think we just keep hearing over and
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
over again the serious shortcomings of
 
00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:23.569 align:start position:0%
over again the serious shortcomings of
this

00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:23.579 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
um there's a concept here that may be
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
considered but this is I mean you can
 
00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
look at the the page that representative
 
00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
Ladd put together and what Ms Clark had
 
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
talked about before this isn't going to
 
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
work this belongs back with education I
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
would think the appropriate motion here
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
is to itl this we know they're thinking
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
about it we know they're working on it
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
we are not the ones to do the policy and
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
we are certainly not the experts in the
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
education and so I think the appropriate
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
motion is to itl this and let education
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
be free to do their job this is their
 
00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:01.250 align:start position:0%
be free to do their job this is their
work

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
all right let's put this one thank you
 
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:10.140 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder did you have an
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
Escape

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
before I get to my trust fund
 
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
Amendment on my way over
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
I got stopped by the chairman of
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
who had a conversation
 
00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:58.140 align:start position:0%
with wait
 
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
um the state police
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
and they point out the fact that
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
someone could get bailed after they've
 
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
been arrested
 
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
say in Manchester
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
get out on the street and go back up
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
some way to Conway or someplace and get
 
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
arrested again
 
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
get bailed again and the people in
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
Conway don't know he's already on bail
 
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
so they went to their their uh vendors
 
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
that do their
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
their system and say they could fix this
 
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
for a million dollars
 
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
all the state police would be aware of
 
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
or who the police departments would be
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
aware of who had been bailed that they
 
01:00:43.609 --> 01:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
just arrested so they've already should
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
be a revocation of bail and sent back to
 
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:47.339 align:start position:0%
the original place so however they want
 
01:00:49.609 --> 01:00:49.619 align:start position:0%
to deal with it but the point is
 
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
people could run every time they're
 
01:00:53.329 --> 01:00:53.339 align:start position:0%
they're released on bail and go and do
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
another crime
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
and keep getting bailed it seems like
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
they're bailing too easy so to bring
 
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
that forward when you get to your safety
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
this department of safety discussion
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
State Police but anyway back to
 
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
the adequacy education trust fund in
 
01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
1999 we sat down we discussed what
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy was we came up with a figure we
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
funded it on the on the student count
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:24.299 align:start position:0%
and we found ways to fund it through the
 
01:01:26.569 --> 01:01:26.579 align:start position:0%
various funding sources
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
and that's what we did and it increased
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
every every year by CPI
 
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.530 align:start position:0%
every every year by CPI
so

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
what's happening now is
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
the sources we fund it with have
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
increased and the adequacy has gone down
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
as the we've had a very dramatic
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
decrease in student population since we
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
passed this
 
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.089 align:start position:0%
passed this
so

01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
I want to return to the original purpose
 
01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:57.059 align:start position:0%
of Education trust fund which was just
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
to fund adequacy and we deliberately
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
made it a little less because some years
 
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
before we had that bill
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
we had money coming from Lottery
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
we put in the budget 103 million 102
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
million because that's what the
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
estimated previously then they ended up
 
01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
with 105 million so there were three
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
million more going to education than we
 
01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:25.140 align:start position:0%
had anticipated we'd already put all the
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
other money in there so they got three
 
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
million more
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
then we had anticipated but they spent
 
01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:31.370 align:start position:0%
then we had anticipated but they spent
it

01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
we could have used that 3 million in a
 
01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
couple of other places that were a
 
01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
little short
 
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
but instead they had a surplus and they
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
spent it
 
01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:42.059 align:start position:0%
so we always made sure that adequacy was
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
a little less
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
from the sources of revenue then
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
what we thought we needed and we'd fill
 
01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:51.299 align:start position:0%
it up with General funds General funds
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
were also used for for special ed they
 
01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
were used for tuition and transportation
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
they were used for building Aid they
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
were used for all these other things the
 
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
only thing education trust fund was for
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
was for adequacy
 
01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
so I I'm bringing in an amendment that
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
returns to its roots by reducing the
 
01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
money that is taken out of the education
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
out of the Business Center business
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
Enterprise and business profits taxes so
 
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
that only enough is is going in there to
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
cover some of the things that are
 
01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:27.140 align:start position:0%
inadequacy which usually in now includes
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
01:03:35.569 --> 01:03:35.579 align:start position:0%
charter school funding
 
01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:36.770 align:start position:0%
charter school funding
um

01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:40.329 --> 01:03:40.339 align:start position:0%
and education Freedom accounts
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
kindergarten Aid public and things like
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
this would reduce
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of money there is still the
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
same amount of money available but now
 
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to use up the education
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
trust fund by putting it here and
 
01:03:59.569 --> 01:03:59.579 align:start position:0%
putting it there when it I took some of
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
those things ought to compete with
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
everything else that competes with
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
general fund over here we might be short
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
several places
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
in general fund while over here we're
 
01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
looking for some place to spend that we
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
can call education
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
and it's it's not a good way to manage
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
the budget the only money that should go
 
01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
in there because of the way we we
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
originated the education trust fund was
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
for adequacy all the other things will
 
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
compete on a regular basis with
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
everything else that's in the general
 
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
fund so that's my intent that's the way
 
01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:32.540 align:start position:0%
it was historically for you know since
 
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
2000 uh since 2000 so that's what I'd
 
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
like to go back to because now it's it's
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
coming up with a surplus which previous
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
budget we took 100 million out of it it
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
shows you how much more it's bringing in
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
than it really needed
 
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
so that 100 million there were several
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
other places it could have been used so
 
01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
that's that's the reason for the
 
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.329 align:start position:0%
that's that's the reason for the
amendment

01:04:53.329 --> 01:04:53.339 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
um and that's what it does
 
01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.299 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions I know
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's going to be one here
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so you put forth
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:10.910 align:start position:0%
this proposal
um

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
today is really the last day that we
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
have to work
 
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.990 align:start position:0%
have to work
um

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
is this proposal for the budget we're
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
working on now
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
it it makes very little change to the to
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
the budget as as you've proceeded so far
 
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
it just puts the education trust fund
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
back to its original purpose and its
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
original numbers
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
but if I may
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
um we have a number of other items we
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
have building Aid we have special ed Aid
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things that are
 
01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
included in the trust right now
 
01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
um we even have the CTE Center that's in
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
the trust right now
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
and where do you propose
 
01:05:58.849 --> 01:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
you're taking
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
everything out of the trust right now
 
01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
and moving it into general fund right
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
for those items that we have approved
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
will they be moved over a degree general
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
fund it's too late in the process and
 
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
I've lectured people on this many times
 
01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:18.299 align:start position:0%
it's too late in the process for big
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
changes this isn't a big change
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's just saying
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
this is now funded from this rather than
 
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
that but it's still funded to the same
 
01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
amount so with all due respect I'm
 
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
trying to figure this out so you're
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
telling me that this isn't change
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
and all this all the things that we're
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
can we just put this into effect for the
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
next biennium and not this one
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Mr chair please
 
01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
as long as it goes into effect we need
 
01:06:58.010 --> 01:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
to restore the education trust fund to
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
what it was so we don't sit here saying
 
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
oh we got extra money to spend an
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
education over here but gee was short
 
01:07:05.569 --> 01:07:05.579 align:start position:0%
over there in general funds I don't want
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
to ever have that happen so would you be
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
opposed if I'm in a motion that the
 
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
impact of this amendment would not be
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
you're free to make any motion you want
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would like to move that this
 
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.690 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would like to move that this
amendment

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
um be given an effective date for um the
 
01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
biennium beginning in 26 Mickey am I
 
01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.150 align:start position:0%
biennium beginning in 26 Mickey am I
correct

01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
if the intent is to have this affected
 
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
the next biennium yes it'd be one July 1
 
01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:40.430 align:start position:0%
the next biennium yes it'd be one July 1
2025.

01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
I oppose that because I think this needs
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
to be made sooner than later and it
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect the intent is not to
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
affect any of the decisions you have
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
no no I just have a couple questions if
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
I could
 
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
um you know the governor's proposal
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
loses this is 65 to 35. we don't have it
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.329 --> 01:08:17.339 align:start position:0%
okay motion dies okay
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
um the Tasmania the 65 to 35 percent uh
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's change
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
um to the allocation and you've moved it
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
from 77.5 to 22.5 which is a to me
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's a big that's a significant change
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm just sort of wondering uh what
 
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
you're basing that on and why you're
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
opposed to the governor's proposal here
 
01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:39.349 align:start position:0%
opposed to the governor's proposal here
and

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
um I would also you know I could think
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
it's pretty easy to argue that special
 
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
education is education and education
 
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
belongs in the education trust fund and
 
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
to see that it's going from you know 96
 
01:08:54.289 --> 01:08:54.299 align:start position:0%
in at 96 million education down to three
 
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
and a half that's also a significant
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
change so
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
um I certainly understand that there can
 
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
be too large of a surplus and it's
 
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
probably probably not appropriate to
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
hold some of that in the education trust
 
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
fund but what I see you doing here is
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
essentially draining the education trust
 
01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
fund which is not something I can
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
support but I guess if you can address
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
how you came up with your numbers as
 
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
opposed to the governor's numbers which
 
01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
I think are more appropriate and why
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
can't special education be part of
 
01:09:21.839 --> 01:09:24.530 align:start position:0%
can't special education be part of
Education

01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
Education
 
01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
it wasn't for 20 years it was in general
 
01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:30.050 align:start position:0%
it wasn't for 20 years it was in general
funds

01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
it was always that way for 20 years the
 
01:09:34.849 --> 01:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
only reason it's been taken up is
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
because the education trust fund had a
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
surplus obviously last budget had a
 
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
hundred million that was taken out so
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
that money could have been used
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
somewhere else rather than it was good
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
that it went as a tax cut however I
 
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
still haven't seen the tax cut in my tax
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
bills so it seemed like
 
01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:57.620 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that special education
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be funded by education I mean
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
the fact that it was in there for 20
 
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
years isn't part of adequacy
 
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
but the the fact that it wasn't in the
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
education trust fund doesn't necessarily
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
mean that it shouldn't belong there that
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a good reason there's
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
explanation for having it in the trust
 
01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:15.980 align:start position:0%
fund Beyond adequacy
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
adequacy was a very set amount it's now
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
gone for 20 plus years until we've
 
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
suddenly decided we're going to spend it
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
here and we're going to spend it there I
 
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
don't like the idea of that saying well
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
we can put this in education trust fund
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
it should not have a surplus because it
 
01:10:35.209 --> 01:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
robs some other places that are just as
 
01:10:35.219 --> 01:10:38.229 align:start position:0%
robs some other places that are just as
important

01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
adequacy was to defend us from a lawsuit
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
and it did that for 20 years
 
01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.330 align:start position:0%
and it did that for 20 years
so

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
I would like to make sure that it's back
 
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
to its original roots and its two
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
decades of of serving its purpose and
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
it's gotten away from that because of
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
this huge reduction in student
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
population that has occurred since we
 
01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:04.460 align:start position:0%
passed it in 99.
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair again for letting me
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
01:11:09.239 --> 01:11:10.370 align:start position:0%
take questions
um so

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
part of the reasons why the education
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
trust has seen the revenue increase that
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's seen is because of the
 
01:11:19.199 --> 01:11:20.689 align:start position:0%
it's seen is because of the
really

01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:11:20.699 --> 01:11:22.490 align:start position:0%
really
aggressive

01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
aggressive
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
um economy that we saw especially during
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic now you mentioned the um
 
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.910 align:start position:0%
the pandemic now you mentioned the um
lawsuit

01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.510 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
um

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
Mr chair we we have another lawsuit
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
coming in all probability if there's
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
actually two I believe in place and how
 
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
will it look
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
to the courts
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
for us to be taking money from the trust
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
instead of putting money into the trust
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
or even just leaving it is and really
 
01:11:58.850 --> 01:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
applying those funds I would encourage
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
you to really think about this proposal
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
as of right now in terms of how the
 
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
courts will perceive your actions
 
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit is not in the same area of
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
adequacy that going after the
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
tax on utilities that's what the
 
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
lawsuit's about so I don't see it as
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.719 --> 01:12:29.450 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Weiler chairwyler
 
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
um while I was on the campaign Trail
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
this past season
 
01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
um I spoke to almost every constituent
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
in my district and their number one
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
concern was with protecting public
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
schools and the funding mechanisms for
 
01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.410 align:start position:0%
schools and the funding mechanisms for
that

01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering
 
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
um this this proposal seems to be a
 
01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:55.460 align:start position:0%
Monumental shift in the way
 
01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
our state chooses to fund public
 
01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
education in the state and I'm wondering
 
01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
you know when you were you know maybe
 
01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
you could share your perspective on you
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
know why this is such a priority in your
 
01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.530 align:start position:0%
know why this is such a priority in your
District

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
nobody even knows where the money is
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
coming from they just know they're
 
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.030 align:start position:0%
coming from they just know they're
getting

01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
and and from our budget we've put out
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
over a billion dollars a year to the
 
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
towns that's all they're looking at they
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
don't know how much is going to Highway
 
01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
block grant and they don't know how much
 
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
is is going to
 
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
paying for water repairs all they know
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
is how much are we getting from the
 
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
state that's the only thing that people
 
01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
mention they all want to make sure
 
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
schools are funded and we all do we've
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
never decided not to fund schools we've
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
never really cut back on the education
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
amount we sent to schools as they say
 
01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
it's a major part of our budget
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
so as long as the money is coming in
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
nobody really cares what column it's
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
coming and that's those of us that deal
 
01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:57.709 align:start position:0%
coming and that's those of us that deal
with

01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
the financial part of it care what
 
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
column it's in but the the people that
 
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
are getting the money they don't care
 
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
they'll still get the same amount we've
 
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
always funded Special Ed we've always
 
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
funded building Aid we've always funded
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
these things so and transportation and
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
tuition those have always been funded
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
from general fund
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
nobody cared where the money was coming
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
from as long as they were getting the
 
01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:20.990 align:start position:0%
from as long as they were getting the
money

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so we made sure that they had they
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
get the money
 
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
and I remember special ed we would go up
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
sometimes 12 a year and it wasn't enough
 
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
you could never tell what's special end
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
what the cost would be so if you put
 
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
something like that in education trust
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
fund you never know what it'll be it is
 
01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
so unpredictable
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
it could go down one year that would be
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
an amazing thing but you know if you try
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
to fit it in a set funding source you'd
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
be very unsuccessful it has to compete
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
with everything else that comes up that
 
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
year you may have to make a cut
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere else so you could fully fund
 
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
it but the funding we do we take care of
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
here in division two I've been in
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
division two since 1992.
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
and we've always managed to fund
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
everything that education needed so I
 
01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
don't see that this is going to imperil
 
01:15:17.689 --> 01:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
any of the funding that education gets I
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
just want to have its return to its
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
roots that was respected for 20 years
 
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
and now has gotten off the tracks I want
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
to bring it back to what it was intended
 
01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
for and what it worked for for 20 years
 
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:15:34.209 --> 01:15:34.219 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for taking my question
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
does this anyway affect the governor's
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
proposal in any way
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
it goes along with it
 
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
it tweaks it because because we're
 
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
increasing adequacy or through the
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal we actually headed
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
in his budget to reduce the amount
 
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
coming out of business Enterprise tax
 
01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
and business profits tax it was in his
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
proposal I was thinking along those same
 
01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
lines and I thought yes this is moving
 
01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
in the right direction I made a little
 
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
tweak that's what it amounts to he may
 
01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
like it
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:13.820 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
um can you guarantee me
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
that the things that we've approved that
 
01:16:23.689 --> 01:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
we're working on now will be
 
01:16:23.699 --> 01:16:25.370 align:start position:0%
we're working on now will be
approved

01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
I have voted for most of the things in
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
division two that got passed and I have
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
gone along with almost all the things
 
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
and unless we come at the last minute
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
and say oh my word we're
 
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
10 million over 20 million of them was
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
have to go back and make cuts that may
 
01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
happen but I'm ready to support
 
01:16:49.729 --> 01:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
everything division two has done to date
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
unless something else comes up
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
um just one more plea just because we're
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
in the middle of things and today is the
 
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
last day and I can't even imagine how
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
much work Mickey has and for him to have
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
to do the shifts for all of this into
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
the general fund I think it's adding a
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
lot of work for him it's adding
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
confusion for us on the last hour I
 
01:17:18.649 --> 01:17:18.659 align:start position:0%
would really like you to consider the
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
start date for this at another time
 
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have given uh
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
Mickey enough heads up on this that I
 
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
think he's already done the work
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it's going to be a real
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
great burden on him I think he's way
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
I would appreciate a quick summary just
 
01:17:44.689 --> 01:17:44.699 align:start position:0%
because there is a lot of data of what
 
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
are the governor suggested changes and
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
what are what you know what's different
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
in this amendment just honestly to get
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
may need some help Mickey it's it's the
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
areas on
 
01:18:03.239 --> 01:18:04.729 align:start position:0%
areas on
the

01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:07.460 align:start position:0%
if you go to page five of this packet
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
essentially the highlighted the shaded
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
rose indicate the changes affected by
 
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
so you'll see online 15 and 16 is the
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
increase in the portion of the business
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
taxes that would go to the general fund
 
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
versus the education trust fund so when
 
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget those
 
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
amounts were based on their revenue
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
projections approximately 73 million
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
dollars per year that would shift over
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
and this goes up to 223 224 so about 150
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
million per year more than the governors
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
of Revenue shifting between the two
 
01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:49.250 align:start position:0%
of Revenue shifting between the two
funds

01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
and then special education Aid tuition
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
and transportation School building Aid
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
the court ordered placements as well as
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
the new episode of treatment payments
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
that this committee adopted earlier be
 
01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
building a lease which is relative to
 
01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools and the CT renovation uh
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
the 12 and a half million we're all in
 
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget as
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
education trust fund if you flip to page
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
six of this packet you'll see those
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
figures presented there in the at the
 
01:19:17.689 --> 01:19:17.699 align:start position:0%
current levels that this division has
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
them at would be shifted to the general
 
01:19:19.679 --> 01:19:21.530 align:start position:0%
them at would be shifted to the general
fund

01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
so there is no decrease to any of the
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
aid programs
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
in this amendment here just shifting
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
between education trust fund to general
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
fund I appreciate the clarifications
 
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
and the funds go with the and the funds
 
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
go with so the revenue the revenue
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
changes where the funds would go with it
 
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
so the revenue would go to the general
 
01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
fund and these Appropriations would be
 
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
shifted to the general fund so the total
 
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
ins and out of the general fund would
 
01:19:48.169 --> 01:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
increase ins and out of the education
 
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
trust fund would decrease Net Zero
 
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
gives us the needed flexibility as an
 
01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:55.850 align:start position:0%
gives us the needed flexibility as an
overall

01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
overall
 
01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:59.090 align:start position:0%
overall
budget

01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you and thanks for
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
the overview there I just I can agree
 
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
that there are some things here that
 
01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:08.219 align:start position:0%
could appropriately be moved out of the
 
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
um I think the 12 percent change from
 
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
the 65 to the 77 percentages is more
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
than a tweak I think that's a pretty
 
01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
significant change so I have an
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
objection to that and I do think that
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
there's um you know you're right that
 
01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
people aren't looking at the budget in
 
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
terms of what comes from where but I
 
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
think it'll be there'll be push but
 
01:20:31.610 --> 01:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
there'll be quite a shock for special ed
 
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
people when they see the special ed is
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
not in the education trust fund and
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's a sense of guaranteeing it'll
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
get funded when it's in the education
 
01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
trust fund and I think that Assurance
 
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
goes away if it's taken out of the trust
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
fund if you ask them how many years
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
General uh how many years special ed was
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
not funded in the education trust fund
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
they would not have a clue
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
that's probably I'm sure you're
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely right but there is a
 
01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
statement of importance that it is in
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
many previous budgets did not have it in
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
20 years of them
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr Mr chairman so I I
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
don't see where
 
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
um this is just a simple percentage or
 
01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
calculated uh change it it looks like
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
every single item that's every item that
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
is has to be recalculated for business
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
profits business Enterprise
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
um sweepstakes and Lottery
 
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.790 align:start position:0%
um sweepstakes and Lottery
tobacco

01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
01:21:58.090 --> 01:21:58.100 align:start position:0%
the tobacco settlement tax
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
amount every single item has to be
 
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.649 align:start position:0%
amount every single item has to be
recalculated

01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
recalculated
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
so the only Revenue change here
 
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative Buco is the business
 
01:22:08.689 --> 01:22:08.699 align:start position:0%
profits and business Enterprise tax so
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see on lines 15 and 16 the
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
revenue adjustments associated with
 
01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
those so this the share of BPT would
 
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
actually still be an increase of 23.2
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars and 23.5 million dollars
 
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
but the big decrease is relative to the
 
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax I see that on
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
line 16. so the net of those is about
 
01:22:30.729 --> 01:22:30.739 align:start position:0%
224 million dollars per year
 
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
I don't think that I'm following the
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
lines that you're on so on page five of
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment packet
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
the is that representative Weiler 1105
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment packet
 
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
lines again please so lines 15 and 16.
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I just wanted
 
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
to mention that in fact
 
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
um there was a time that in fact we
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
actually when we were in the majority we
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
actually moved building a special ed Aid
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
um and a few of these things into the
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
um trust because the trust was very
 
01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
healthy that year and the general fund
 
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
they were um in the other two divisions
 
01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
they were really struggling and this was
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
a way to help the budget and that's why
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
we've been moving forward all these
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
things seem to support the education
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
process so it seemed a very positive
 
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
move and I thought it was a very
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
effective one
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
um and and again it released the general
 
01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
fund from this that's kind of the
 
01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
history behind it so I think it's one
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
two three bienniums Mickey that I think
 
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
we changed it
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
I think it was the 1819 yes I believe
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
2021 sorry I'm off of biennium
 
01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.689 --> 01:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
yeah if I can just you know as I think
 
01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
that there are things to you to discuss
 
01:24:21.169 --> 01:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
here that there is um an appropriate
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
action to be taken I'm not I'm pretty
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
sure this is not one that I could
 
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
support and I have to say it's kind of a
 
01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
tough gig to bring it in at literally
 
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
the 11th Hour uh when we've been having
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
this since beginning you know
 
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
mid-February or so that um this becomes
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh more of a challenge and it would have
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
been appreciated I mean it this is the
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
11th hour and I don't think this is a
 
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
very good time to bring in an amendment
 
01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
that makes such a significant change I
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
had to wait until I saw how much was
 
01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
spending in each of the areas before I
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
could bring it forward and figure out
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what the tweak would be on what
 
01:24:57.169 --> 01:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
the governor had suggested that's why I
 
01:24:59.810 --> 01:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
waited till this last hour wanted to see
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
what those Figures were
 
01:25:06.649 --> 01:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
like uh one of the things we we made a
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
commitment as a legislature to fund two
 
01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.970 align:start position:0%
commitment as a legislature to fund two
ctes

01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
ctes
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
usually that goes in the capital budget
 
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
we can't do they can't do it they don't
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
have enough money so that's one of the
 
01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
reasons why you've probably put it in
 
01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
this amendment and made sure it was
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
getting paid but but as long as it's
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
paid and fulfill our commitment we've
 
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
done what we've set out to do
 
01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
and it would likely have come out of
 
01:25:39.169 --> 01:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
so my first question is we've been
 
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
looking at variations of a school
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
I don't remember us looking at
 
01:25:56.770 --> 01:25:56.780 align:start position:0%
variations and yes we have like
 
01:26:00.169 --> 01:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
529 I think it was yes we we've done
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
that consistently that doesn't change
 
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
that that still ends up as adequacy so
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
but can we continue our work on the
 
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
formulas that we're working on this
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that and my second
 
01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.350 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that and my second
question

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:17.900 align:start position:0%
sorry on line 17
 
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
automatic support from the general fund
 
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
goes away and then it requires fiscal
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
for them to go to the fiscal committee
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
so what what will that result in
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
what's that on line 17 yes of your
 
01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.870 align:start position:0%
what's that on line 17 yes of your
Amendment

01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
but I think I might be able to answer
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
this So currently the department of
 
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
education does not have a mechanism to
 
01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
draw additional general or education
 
01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
trust funds during a biennium without
 
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
legislation if you recall when doe came
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
in they had suggested having an ability
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
to go to fiscal to draw an education
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
trust fund to cover administrative costs
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
that are not in their budget so this
 
01:26:59.810 --> 01:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
amendment does include that provision
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.659 --> 01:27:08.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
oh question yeah I'm um this is more of
 
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
a comment uh Mr chair
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
I have um great concern about this
 
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
amendment but
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
um I also have deeper concern for the
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
process involved in this proposal I
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
think you know we are not subjecting
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
this to a public hearing at any point
 
01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
and given the 11th hour I think we are
 
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
missing stakeholder input and
 
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
um you know I know I know chairman
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
Weiler Prides himself on the process and
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of this committee
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
um and I think that it's missing a
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
significant piece of the puzzle here
 
01:27:50.689 --> 01:27:50.699 align:start position:0%
I I don't feel comfortable moving
 
01:27:52.729 --> 01:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
forward with us without you know hearing
 
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
from the public at large about what
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
their opinions are clearly there is 20
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
years of legislative history since these
 
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
changes have gone into effect and to
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
unwind that as the chairman has even
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
stayed in his own testimony no one knows
 
01:28:09.649 --> 01:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
where the money comes for it I don't I
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
don't remember him saying that anyone
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
has specifically asked for this and that
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know I think moving forward it would
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
be a large
 
01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.550 align:start position:0%
be a large
um

01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:21.610 --> 01:28:21.620 align:start position:0%
I think it would be a significant
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
mistake to move so quickly at 11 30 on
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
the day that our deadlines are due
 
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
without hearing from the greater public
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
at large about this proposal so I I'm
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
just putting on the record that I can't
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
support this
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman uh I think if
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
uh if you remember what the chairman
 
01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
Weil said was that it was in the public
 
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
it was in the governor's eye he alluded
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
to doing this
 
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
and so it has been out there and people
 
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
have been able to comment and they have
 
01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
you know they have the ability to you
 
01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
know and we've been
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
constantly bombarded by constituents as
 
01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
to what goes on and I think this is the
 
01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:06.770 align:start position:0%
to what goes on and I think this is the
best

01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:29:11.689 --> 01:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
way to proceed on this because
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
we can't take other other things out of
 
01:29:15.649 --> 01:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
the trust fund but if there's money
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
there we can't afford things in the
 
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
general fund and all this money sitting
 
01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
there that can't be used I mean that's
 
01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
we we got to see that I mean it's
 
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
it's almost a no-brainer
 
01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
yes question
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if any committee memory
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
members are steering that very long
 
01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
public input session on HP one hp2
 
01:29:42.890 --> 01:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
getting even one comment on the proposed
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
changes in the funding of the education
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
trust fund from the public because I
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
really don't but I could have missed
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I move this amendment uh
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
2023 1105 h
 
01:29:58.199 --> 01:29:59.629 align:start position:0%
2023 1105 h
as

01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:29:59.639 --> 01:30:02.330 align:start position:0%
as
okay

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
by show of hands we have a motion to
 
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.679 --> 01:30:14.810 align:start position:0%
 
five

01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
a post
 
01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:18.410 align:start position:0%
a post
for

01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion passes
 
01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to clarify the motion
 
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.010 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to clarify the motion
here

01:30:25.010 --> 01:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
the house bill 2 Amendment as well as
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
the swap of funding that's detailed on
 
01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:32.219 align:start position:0%
the last two pages of this packet so
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
there will be a dollar for dollar
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation shift for those programs
 
01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund to the
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
general fund in house bill one and I
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
also want to point the committee to one
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
previous action that we will just have
 
01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
to revisit so if you go to page 21 of
 
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
your big Amendment packet that I passed
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
out earlier today our episode of
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
treatment Amendment the five House Bill
 
01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:54.900 align:start position:0%
521 language that we added to host Bill
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
2 there's an appropriation associated
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
with that we had left that as education
 
01:31:00.410 --> 01:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
trust funds at that time but as part of
 
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh that we just adopted I will redraft
 
01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
the episode of treatment so if you look
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
up page 21 that Roman 5 talks about
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund in the statute for
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
this so I'll update that to be general
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
fund so I look at that as a technical
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
required to facilitate the amendment you
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
just adopted okay
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
I think as long as everyone just
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
understands that the emotion you just
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
took on this amendment will have a
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
couple other technical fixes that I'll
 
01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
we'll switch that to General funds and
 
01:31:40.189 --> 01:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
statute to align with the action on
 
01:31:43.870 --> 01:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
okay now we're back to the
 
01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
and the motion is by representative
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
I was looking at the wrong part of the
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
book here thank you for correcting me
 
01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
s i i do I I needed some clarification
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
on adequate suggestions because we
 
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
talked about it briefly
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
and we had been discussing in committee
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
adding 20 million dollars per year to
 
01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
the right side of of the equation
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh I I just need to get some
 
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.729 --> 01:32:55.739 align:start position:0%
we basically have two different
 
01:32:59.090 --> 01:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
documents one is the original document
 
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.010 align:start position:0%
 
.

01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
I guess the the question the question
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
comes up is do we have the 20 million
 
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
dollars each year available to put on
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
the right hand side of the for of the
 
01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:18.770 align:start position:0%
the right hand side of the for of the
formula

01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
formula
 
01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:20.990 align:start position:0%
formula
if

01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
not moved with the formula
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
the governor the governor's
 
01:34:30.169 --> 01:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
what what we did what we discussed was
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
the in the governor's uh formula
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
our thought was to accelerate it in Year
 
01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.530 align:start position:0%
our thought was to accelerate it in Year
One

01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
One
 
01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
and reduce the increase from 50 percent
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
to 35 percent in future years
 
01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
but if we don't have the 20 million
 
01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
dollars each
 
01:34:58.610 --> 01:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
year to put in
 
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
then we revert back to the governor's
 
01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:05.390 align:start position:0%
then we revert back to the governor's
formula

01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.729 --> 01:35:07.739 align:start position:0%
education education trust fund but
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what part of this
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
not with not not with the action you
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
just took so now we have a new education
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
trust fund situation which is page five
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
of the amendment package so through
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
decisions to this point there's
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
3.449 million dollars in the education
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
trust fund so any further actions of
 
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
increasing any of the remaining programs
 
01:35:36.649 --> 01:35:36.659 align:start position:0%
in the education trust fund would put
 
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
the fund into deficit and be a general
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
fund transfer
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
the The Proposal that was talking about
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
is is adding an additional 20 million
 
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
per year above and beyond the governor's
 
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
funding level
 
01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
this is this is not a funding Swap this
 
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
is new money that's being discussed now
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
so will and the new money was supposed
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
to be in the education trust fund yeah
 
01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:08.219 align:start position:0%
but so far we've used up the education
 
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
01:36:13.129 --> 01:36:13.139 align:start position:0%
even under the old standards there
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't 20 million extra in there and
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
these figures you had so the other one
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
prior to that there there was and that
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
that was the page four of this handout
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
if you go back
 
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
20 minutes ago where we were to we had
 
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
it there was 96 million so that net 92
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
million or so
 
01:36:36.169 --> 01:36:36.179 align:start position:0%
is now in the general fund based on the
 
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
adoption of amendment 1105h
 
01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
it's in the general fund without
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
assignment correct but it's within this
 
01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
committee correct so that's that would
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
be the source
 
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
so if if this committee were to proceed
 
01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
with increasing adequacy
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
they were just again historically that's
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
what we've always done we're always
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
intentionally underfunded adequacy so if
 
01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
it went over we wouldn't have that money
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
locked up we always underfunded adequacy
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
which this is this goes along with what
 
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
we've done for 20 years so yes the
 
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
yeah if this if this showed 96 million
 
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
that was unassigned on this page it's
 
01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
still unassigned do we need emotion
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
well we're going to proceed with the
 
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
most comparable the the 40 million is
 
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
going to have to come out of general
 
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
fund yes but it's within this division
 
01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:34.310 align:start position:0%
fund yes but it's within this division
right

01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
so the question but there's the other
 
01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
question is do
 
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
that means we're going to be spending
 
01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
but overall will you be spending more
 
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
than the governor
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
then why was the 96 million shown as a
 
01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.390 align:start position:0%
then why was the 96 million shown as a
balance

01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
balance
 
01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget had 148 million
 
01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
dollars at the end of 25 is a balance so
 
01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
with Revenue estimates change with a
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
couple of the policy differences this
 
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
has been a moving number based on the
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
decisions that the full committee and
 
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
division two has made and that's just
 
01:38:11.209 --> 01:38:11.219 align:start position:0%
where we were going into today and then
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
you can see the change of of the
 
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
amendment so it's really up to
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
the division how you want to proceed
 
01:38:20.330 --> 01:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
here so the governor showed a surplus
 
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
yes and he didn't assign it correct okay
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
so now we still have a 90 because of
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
this we still have the 96 million is it
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
yep the 96 now is down to 3.5 without a
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
memo you just adopted
 
01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
right but it's in the general funds now
 
01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
so it's part of the bigger
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
bigger pot of money for all across all
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
three divisions
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
this is the 96 and they want to spend 40
 
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
of it here
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
which will still keep us from from going
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
over the governor's budget
 
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
are you talking about for adequacy
 
01:38:52.610 --> 01:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
specifically or The Total Money the
 
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
total that would be coming I don't know
 
01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:55.139 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the other divisions
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
to say no but in this within this
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
division within this Division if you
 
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
combine General and education yes you
 
01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.270 align:start position:0%
combine General and education yes you
you

01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.729 align:start position:0%
you
uh

01:39:03.729 --> 01:39:03.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
Appropriations no if you added 20
 
01:39:07.729 --> 01:39:07.739 align:start position:0%
million per year but as far as available
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
funds from within the education trust
 
01:39:12.649 --> 01:39:12.659 align:start position:0%
fund that you switched in uh I think
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
that those weren't funds that were
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
counted on at some point in this process
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that 90 million or so
 
01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
shifting between education in general is
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
part of your bigger picture for the
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
other divisions so I can't answer that
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
no it was not taken into account all the
 
01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
divisions are expected to reduce their
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
budgets to the 85 million deficit that
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
we saw after we passed the ways and
 
01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
means Revenue estimate and I think from
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
what I spoke to your boss I think uh
 
01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
Elba Mike Kane I think was coming very
 
01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's really a priority of the division
 
01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
what you want to end with for balances
 
01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:56.030 align:start position:0%
what you want to end with for balances
so

01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
how much you want to spend versus how
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
much you want to have at the end of the
 
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
biennium or the end of fiscal 23 and
 
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 to the rainy day fund those
 
01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
are decisions that would be impacted
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
by if you just if you do an additional
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
20 or not for adequacy understood so you
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
want to spend 40 million a year or 40
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
million total 40 total total 20 20 per
 
01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:17.390 align:start position:0%
million total 40 total total 20 20 per
year

01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
okay so you'd still be left with with 56
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
correct not a problem
 
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:31.310 align:start position:0%
correct not a problem
okay

01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
as I said historically we've always
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
added money to adequacy from the general
 
01:40:40.729 --> 01:40:40.739 align:start position:0%
fund this is nothing new
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's finally so everybody feels
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable the 96 million we have 40
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
million that we're going to apply toward
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
the adequacy formula and the remainder
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
of the 96 million apart from the 40
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
million that we're spending will be
 
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
retained in division two over which we
 
01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
will have discretion to spend is that
 
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct I just asked for
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
a million dollars for the state police
 
01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
now you can use it I think we couldn't
 
01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:20.090 --> 01:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
you could use it for the 40 million and
 
01:41:21.649 --> 01:41:21.659 align:start position:0%
you'll have a million that you can use
 
01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
for the State Police so everybody knows
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
who's been bailed when they arrest them
 
01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
so that's not an hb2
 
01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
or is that just ice cream one no not yet
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
I just brought it I just brought it in
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
as an amendment because I was requested
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
from the chair of Criminal Justice
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
so that's another assignment for Mickey
 
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
to work on and for you to prove later
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
you might want to discuss it with the
 
01:41:50.450 --> 01:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
state police okay
 
01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to double check again
 
01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
because chairman Weiler is the only
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
person in the room that has visibility
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
across all three divisions if those
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
funds are available in terms of the
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
bottom line overall because I want to
 
01:42:06.890 --> 01:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
make sure we are prudent and we don't
 
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
end up agreeing on something and then we
 
01:42:10.129 --> 01:42:10.139 align:start position:0%
meet as a full committee and we discover
 
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
that we're well wildly over I I would
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
just like to understand where we are in
 
01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
terms of that because you know it
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
changes the way I would support or not I
 
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
want to do it but not if it's
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
irresponsible I think division one has
 
01:42:27.770 --> 01:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
made some of the biggest Cuts division
 
01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:31.139 align:start position:0%
three is is seeking to do a 15 increase
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
in Medicaid and they're moving a lot of
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
pieces around the budget call for 3.1
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
percent but all the people that
 
01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
testified before them virtually every
 
01:42:43.609 --> 01:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
Department said oh we need much more we
 
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
need much more some we heard some of
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
that at the public hearing about and and
 
01:42:50.770 --> 01:42:50.780 align:start position:0%
hearing about
 
01:42:52.970 --> 01:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
nursing homes going broke they can't
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
hire people for the money that's
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
available and all they're getting is
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and Medicaid is insufficient
 
01:43:01.129 --> 01:43:01.139 align:start position:0%
for everything so they're trying for a
 
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
big Medicaid addition they're already
 
01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
echoing what the Senate did the Senate
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
added 40 million to the Medicaid
 
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
distributions which of course will be
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
doubled with with the federal input
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
so they're they're kind of moving their
 
01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
pieces around to meet that goal I don't
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
know if we're going to get as much
 
01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
saving there as we will in in division
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
one but division one has has got some
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
big pieces that they are looking at that
 
01:43:29.930 --> 01:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
will likely make it balance well and I
 
01:43:33.169 --> 01:43:33.179 align:start position:0%
think we just division two just
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
basically moved 50 million dollars over
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
to General funds
 
01:43:40.450 --> 01:43:40.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay just to clarify does that it does
 
01:43:47.530 --> 01:43:47.540 align:start position:0%
mean that we have the financial
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to increase the education
 
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
funding to by you know the 20 million
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
per year as requested in your opinion
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's where we are
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
getting ready to vote for that you want
 
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
to show move it or I'll stay here and
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
then I got to go to division three well
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
you don't have all the numbers I'm
 
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
because where we are is um is on this
 
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
one a portrait looking
 
01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:17.870 align:start position:0%
one a portrait looking
document

01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:19.669 align:start position:0%
document
uh

01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
we started here with multiple proposals
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
on the one that's still elusive
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
that graduated into this version that
 
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
has proposals 10 11 and 12 on it that
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
include the 40 million dollars
 
01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
uh and and we also decided to round off
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
some of the pennies to make the straight
 
01:44:44.159 --> 01:44:45.410 align:start position:0%
some of the pennies to make the straight
dollars

01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:44:48.169 --> 01:44:48.179 align:start position:0%
we haven't taken a vote yet on whether
 
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
we're in favor of proposal 10 11 or 12.
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are as far as
 
01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.250 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are as far as
adequacy

01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh this also incorporates the two
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
percent increase each year instead of
 
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
for the biennium and also with the two
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
percent goes to the
 
01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:10.330 align:start position:0%
percent goes to the
EV

01:45:10.330 --> 01:45:10.340 align:start position:0%
EV
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
yeah the equalized valuation per frame
 
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch pupil okay so there's two
 
01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
things going on here the proposals had
 
01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
applied the two percent increase to both
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
the thresholds and the grant
 
01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
so if you remember the governor
 
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget included each biennium
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
for the next five or six bandages
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
increasing the equalized value or excuse
 
01:45:37.129 --> 01:45:37.139 align:start position:0%
me the extraordinary needs Grant from
 
01:45:40.609 --> 01:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
650 times fifty percent each biennium so
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
that would extrapolate up to about 5 000
 
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
by the Max Grant on the out years
 
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
if you take one of these proposals you
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
can see that you're starting your
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Branch much higher
 
01:45:54.649 --> 01:45:54.659 align:start position:0%
than 650. so the committee will have to
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
decide on the out years multiplier if
 
01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
you even want one uh because if you keep
 
01:46:01.629 --> 01:46:01.639 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended of 50
 
01:46:04.729 --> 01:46:04.739 align:start position:0%
starting at 37.50 for instance in
 
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
proposal 10. that'll extrapolate very
 
01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
quickly and get very expensive and I'm
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
not sure that's the intent so you well
 
01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:14.219 align:start position:0%
you know if we did we could back into a
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
percent growth rate to apply to the
 
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
maximum Grant to essentially get to the
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
same end point as the governor around
 
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
five thousand
 
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
um over 10 years just whatever that rate
 
01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
each biennium would be I was I'd have to
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
back into it depending on what you
 
01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
settle on okay yeah
 
01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:35.699 align:start position:0%
is that a number we would need to obtain
 
01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
from Mickey before we vote or is it
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
enough to give him the general guidance
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
that we are looking to put in 20
 
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
whatever the 20 million a year in
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
whichever of the proposals I'm gonna
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
only support 10 but
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
um and then he is expected to then
 
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
adjust the hb2 language the percentage
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
of growth so that at the end of the
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
governor's plan we reach the exam amount
 
01:47:01.490 --> 01:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
of dollars so we just start from a
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
higher base and grow more slowly to get
 
01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
to the same endpoint I just want to make
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
sure that this is the intent of the
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee and that it's allowable to
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
make those motions because
 
01:47:17.050 --> 01:47:17.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere in the five percent range
 
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
is what it would be so instead of 50 to
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
5 by that fifth biennia you would get to
 
01:47:26.510 --> 01:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
the fifth by item you'd get to about
 
01:47:28.129 --> 01:47:28.139 align:start position:0%
where the governor was going to Max it
 
01:47:30.530 --> 01:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
out so you're starting you're you're
 
01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
moving a lot of that Aid Front in the in
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan essentially yeah with a
 
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
slower growth but to get to the same
 
01:47:37.609 --> 01:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
point because you're starting at a
 
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
higher point if you went with like
 
01:47:41.930 --> 01:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
proposal 10 for instance okay
 
01:47:46.490 --> 01:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
everybody understand that all right so
 
01:47:49.609 --> 01:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
what's what's anybody's pleasure oh I'll
 
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
make that motion for proposal 10.
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
and have it end up
 
01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
what she was talking about to end up at
 
01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
the same as the governor's proposal
 
01:48:02.890 --> 01:48:02.900 align:start position:0%
so we just to clarify for everyone
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
proposal 10 is base Aid 4700 per pupil
 
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
frame reduced lunch 2500 per pupil
 
01:48:12.050 --> 01:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
sped rate 2100 per pupil and English
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
language learner 800 per pupil third
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
grade reading would remain repealed as
 
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
proposed by the governor the thresholds
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 24 would be one million to 6
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
million for equalized valuation per free
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch pupil and the maximum
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
grant for the extraordinary need Grant
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
would be 37.50
 
01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
and we will do the biennial increase to
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
the grant amount of five or I'll just
 
01:48:34.010 --> 01:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
double check the math I think it's going
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
to be probably five for a round number
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
and the question is do you want to index
 
01:48:40.729 --> 01:48:40.739 align:start position:0%
the thresholds so the one million and 6
 
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
million are in statute do you want to
 
01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
add the two percent or eight the five
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
percent to those thresholds so those
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
would increase in time
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's up to the committee
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
that was something we had talked about
 
01:48:53.209 --> 01:48:53.219 align:start position:0%
before because otherwise those one
 
01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
million is 6 million would remain the
 
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
same even in the out years and it
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't factor in inflation
 
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay we have a second
 
01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:04.189 align:start position:0%
okay we have a second
okay

01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
we'll incorporate what you just said
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
well I what's what's the decision on
 
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
that do you want to do two percent to
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
keep a uniform with the grant amounts
 
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
are you doing do you want to do five
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
percent to keep it uniformed with the
 
01:49:15.890 --> 01:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
increase of the maximum Grant I think
 
01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
both are probably going to results not
 
01:49:20.689 --> 01:49:20.699 align:start position:0%
much difference over the the duration
 
01:49:20.699 --> 01:49:21.950 align:start position:0%
much difference over the the duration
yeah

01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:49:24.770 --> 01:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that too just because we
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
really want to because Houston
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire proposal and uh
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know there is no point in creating
 
01:49:32.570 --> 01:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
different percentage rates a different
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
percent of the parts of the formula it's
 
01:49:36.649 --> 01:49:36.659 align:start position:0%
complex enough as it is so two percent
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
would apply as the governor proposed to
 
01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
all the the cost of an adequate
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
education components every year
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
two percent will also apply every year
 
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
to the one to six million dollar ratio
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
thresholds and then five percent will
 
01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
start next biennium each biennial
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the Max Grant the governor
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
proposed 50. you're going to do the same
 
01:49:56.930 --> 01:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
model but five percent yes
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
that was his motion yes I think that's
 
01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
the way I understood it too that's
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
perfect I documented it here in 10 words
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
and we have also been made yes
 
01:50:11.689 --> 01:50:11.699 align:start position:0%
yes questions yeah just to make a
 
01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:13.139 align:start position:0%
comment that I think you know proposal
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
10 is certainly an improvement over what
 
01:50:16.129 --> 01:50:16.139 align:start position:0%
we're doing now there's a lot good about
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
it but I'm not going to support it
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
because I think proposal 11 is a better
 
01:50:22.010 --> 01:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
proposal and I want to be able to keep
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
that conversation open and be able to
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
speak to it at some point should that
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
become appropriate okay
 
01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I would concur with that I just want
 
01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
to remind us all that we really
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated our efforts to try to find
 
01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
more Equity to those school districts
 
01:50:40.729 --> 01:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
that have that are struggling and I
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
believe that that a proposal number 11
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
does a better job than number 10. thank
 
01:50:46.679 --> 01:50:48.590 align:start position:0%
does a better job than number 10. thank
you

01:50:48.590 --> 01:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree
 
01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.709 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree
uh

01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
but I think to keep representative puko
 
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
for being tarred and feathered
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
he the top line was the 4700 so I'm
 
01:51:04.729 --> 01:51:04.739 align:start position:0%
looking out for his best interest yeah
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you he
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
proposal Janet gets uh money
 
01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
okay so let's ready for the vote
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
although all those in favor of
 
01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
the motion on proposal ten one two three
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
four five five those opposed
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
copy and paste
 
01:51:35.810 --> 01:51:35.820 align:start position:0%
four okay so the adequacy for proposal
 
01:51:37.689 --> 01:51:37.699 align:start position:0%
10 moves forward
 
01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
now we have now that we know that we
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
have it what is anybody's interest in uh
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
can I I'm sorry Mr chair while we're
 
01:51:49.729 --> 01:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
while we're flying through with adequacy
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
here can we just flip to page 31 of our
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment packet because we can clean up
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney's Charter School
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
bill at this time right our Charter
 
01:52:01.090 --> 01:52:01.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:06.169 --> 01:52:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
so if you recall as this bill came to us
 
01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
the per pupil Grant was the additional
 
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
Grant rather for Charters was increased
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
to 46.27 and I believe the intent of
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
this bill was to get the total amount
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
with base plus the additional Grant to
 
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
be nine thousand right so I've already
 
01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
updated this amendment to include the
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
one the two percent increase to have it
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
uniformed with adequacy so on line eight
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
if you adjust the 46 27 to 4300 even I
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
think that gets us to the Target of nine
 
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
thousand per pupils since you're
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
supporting the 4 700 for base adequacy
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'll do the math but this may not cost
 
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
you much at all because uh you know it
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
was already in there yeah we the the
 
01:52:51.890 --> 01:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
charter well actually let me back up
 
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's not going to cost you as much as
 
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note said because it was 4.9
 
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year is what we were
 
01:52:58.970 --> 01:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
carrying for this bill but by reducing
 
01:53:00.770 --> 01:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
this to 4 300 it'll be somewhere less
 
01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
than that so I'll do that math along
 
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
with the adequacy math and
 
01:53:06.890 --> 01:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
so I kind of emotional move
 
01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:08.350 align:start position:0%
so I kind of emotional move
bite

01:53:08.350 --> 01:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
bite
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
for a second okay all those in favor
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay hey we're in Anniston hey back to
 
01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
the good old days
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay what bill was that
 
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
that amendment is uh it's got to be
 
01:53:24.590 --> 01:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
Rewritten yeah it's Amendment eight
 
01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
correct and we'll we'll update that
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
okay so now we go to Amendment 111h with
 
01:53:37.490 --> 01:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
the 150 000 for
 
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:46.940 align:start position:0%
okay that emotional motion made second
 
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay that was easy we'll move right
 
01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:54.410 align:start position:0%
okay that was easy we'll move right
along

01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
along
 
01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:57.770 align:start position:0%
along
foreign

01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
I was going to say I think we could
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
time is it can I ask a quick question
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
sure all right we just spent forty
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars but we still have 40
 
01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
million yeah right I'm sorry I keep
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
doing that just 40 million sounds like
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
such a huge number to me just I have
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
like one million we wouldn't point you
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
got it yeah we just spent 40 million
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
dollars out of the 96 million dollars so
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
we even though it's been moved to the
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh chairwyler said that we still have
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
access to those dollars so we can go
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
back to the the discussions we were
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
having after lunch
 
01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
um knowing that we have that money
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:52.609 --> 01:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
that is what representative Weiler said
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh as far as that's what I heard what
 
01:54:56.570 --> 01:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
big picture is I can't I can't answer
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
that okay so during lunch we'll come up
 
01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
with a wild way to spend about 50
 
01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:04.250 align:start position:0%
with a wild way to spend about 50
million

01:55:04.250 --> 01:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.649 --> 01:55:08.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
which ones that okay well we'll we'll
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:40.930 --> 01:55:40.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
of the problems
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
I do I do remember I don't remember if
 
01:56:26.450 --> 01:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
it was a formal vote but I believe there
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
was consensus among the committee that
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
at the newer levels you know the reduced
 
01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
adjusted levels sharpened levels
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
it uh I mean I I think there was
 
01:56:40.370 --> 01:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
consensus that it is you know whether we
 
01:56:50.050 --> 01:56:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:57.550 --> 01:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
three instead of five it was five
 
01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
million per year the original
 
01:57:04.609 --> 01:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh no I'm sorry eight eight yes eight
 
01:57:09.890 --> 01:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
not not five the original request was
 
01:57:12.530 --> 01:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
eight right the the reduction that they
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
came forward with was five million
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.609 --> 01:57:24.619 align:start position:0%
that's the most all those in favor
 
01:57:28.189 --> 01:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
unanimous okay
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:23.150 --> 03:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:25.250 --> 03:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:03:31.070 --> 03:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:34.370 --> 03:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
revisit our work session which we're
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
about done with
 
03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:38.990 align:start position:0%
about done with
um

03:03:38.990 --> 03:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:41.210 --> 03:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
one item that uh
 
03:03:45.170 --> 03:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
blvas brought up as the highway fund
 
03:03:49.250 --> 03:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
because last term I think the Senate
 
03:03:51.830 --> 03:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated 20 million additional for
 
03:03:53.210 --> 03:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
the highway fund is that what they said
 
03:03:53.220 --> 03:03:58.010 align:start position:0%
the highway fund is that what they said
uh

03:03:58.010 --> 03:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:00.530 --> 03:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
was that that didn't the Senate put 20
 
03:04:02.510 --> 03:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
million in the highway funnel yeah the
 
03:04:04.010 --> 03:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
last budget did include a I can't
 
03:04:05.269 --> 03:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
remember the exact number that sounds
 
03:04:07.610 --> 03:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
about right uh we'll put the center for
 
03:04:09.469 --> 03:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
the senator yeah it happened later in
 
03:04:13.190 --> 03:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
the process so uh so you're on page
 
03:04:15.410 --> 03:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
eight now of the packet this is the
 
03:04:17.450 --> 03:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
highway fund snapshot that we're working
 
03:04:19.250 --> 03:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
from and this incorporates the changes
 
03:04:21.530 --> 03:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
that we have approved to this point that
 
03:04:23.510 --> 03:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
impact the highway fund as well as those
 
03:04:25.910 --> 03:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal items I was telling you about
 
03:04:28.250 --> 03:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
yesterday I think winter maintenance and
 
03:04:30.830 --> 03:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
there's a safety one so so that that
 
03:04:33.410 --> 03:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
ending balance now and we usually will
 
03:04:34.969 --> 03:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
balance on a gap basis in the highway
 
03:04:37.309 --> 03:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
fund is 5.7 million so the committee
 
03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
could consider who we've discussed this
 
03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
before doing a transfer from the general
 
03:04:45.290 --> 03:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
fund to the highway fund uh to just add
 
03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit of dollars there so there's
 
03:04:49.910 --> 03:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a cushion yeah and uh
 
03:04:52.969 --> 03:04:52.979 align:start position:0%
the only Highway fund request
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Transportation
 
03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
had was on where they had two actually
 
03:04:59.330 --> 03:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
03:05:02.389 --> 03:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
they had requested additional funds for
 
03:05:05.750 --> 03:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
equipment and those telematics which uh
 
03:05:10.130 --> 03:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry on lines 39 and 40.
 
03:05:11.929 --> 03:05:11.939 align:start position:0%
and those were not included in the
 
03:05:15.410 --> 03:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget uh
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:22.250 --> 03:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
so with with the actions taken earlier
 
03:05:25.429 --> 03:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
today I I can't say there's X dollars to
 
03:05:26.990 --> 03:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
spend because again I don't know what
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
the other committees are doing if this
 
03:05:31.670 --> 03:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee did want to entertain a 10
 
03:05:33.410 --> 03:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
million dollar for instance transfer
 
03:05:35.150 --> 03:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
from the general fund to the highway
 
03:05:38.590 --> 03:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
fund to add some cushion here
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
we could do that we're going to end up
 
03:05:43.550 --> 03:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up tallying up all
 
03:05:46.610 --> 03:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
all the divisions work today and
 
03:05:47.990 --> 03:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
see where we are
 
03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
so they could use that 10 million for
 
03:05:50.929 --> 03:05:50.939 align:start position:0%
this equipment purchase if they wanted
 
03:05:53.809 --> 03:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
and you could appropriate that too so if
 
03:05:56.090 --> 03:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
you if you and you don't have to do the
 
03:05:57.769 --> 03:05:57.779 align:start position:0%
full amount either right so the amount
 
03:06:00.050 --> 03:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
that they brought forward was
 
03:06:03.469 --> 03:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
5 million for the biennium 4.7 so you
 
03:06:05.750 --> 03:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
could do something for instance one
 
03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
million or two million per year or
 
03:06:09.889 --> 03:06:09.899 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever number you pick up to
 
03:06:13.190 --> 03:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
that request and then pick X dollars to
 
03:06:14.929 --> 03:06:14.939 align:start position:0%
transfer into the highway fund and that
 
03:06:17.150 --> 03:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
would essentially cover it okay
 
03:06:17.160 --> 03:06:18.110 align:start position:0%
would essentially cover it okay
okay

03:06:18.110 --> 03:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:06:20.389 --> 03:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
total of 10 total ten
 
03:06:23.150 --> 03:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
so it would be five and five what we
 
03:06:24.590 --> 03:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
would probably do is just do a 10
 
03:06:26.750 --> 03:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar transfer of 23 Surplus
 
03:06:29.030 --> 03:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund okay so that would
 
03:06:31.610 --> 03:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
flow through and then right and then you
 
03:06:33.290 --> 03:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
could if you wanted to entertain
 
03:06:36.110 --> 03:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
increasing their equipment line by an
 
03:06:38.210 --> 03:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
amount you see their request but you can
 
03:06:41.630 --> 03:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:44.090 --> 03:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
not unless you appropriate those
 
03:06:45.950 --> 03:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
so the 10 goes into the highway fund but
 
03:06:47.389 --> 03:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
then you need to authorize them to spend
 
03:06:48.830 --> 03:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
it they can't just spend Highway funds
 
03:06:51.410 --> 03:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
without your authorization
 
03:06:53.929 --> 03:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
moved 10 million
 
03:06:57.469 --> 03:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
into the highway into the highway second
 
03:07:00.290 --> 03:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
out of 23 circles
 
03:07:07.929 --> 03:07:07.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:12.370 --> 03:07:12.380 align:start position:0%
okay okay now and you had a comment
 
03:07:14.990 --> 03:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
I did have a question
 
03:07:17.870 --> 03:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
um if I recall correctly uh earlier we
 
03:07:19.790 --> 03:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
were already overdrawn on the Surplus
 
03:07:21.769 --> 03:07:21.779 align:start position:0%
what happens if we allocate funds for
 
03:07:25.849 --> 03:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
will when will we have the opportunity
 
03:07:31.370 --> 03:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
to correct that because how does it work
 
03:07:31.380 --> 03:07:34.250 align:start position:0%
to correct that because how does it work
so

03:07:34.250 --> 03:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:36.230 --> 03:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
how it's going to work this year is
 
03:07:38.809 --> 03:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
we're going to once the dust settles on
 
03:07:40.070 --> 03:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
all the work the three committees are
 
03:07:41.690 --> 03:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
doing we're going to recommend the
 
03:07:41.700 --> 03:07:42.710 align:start position:0%
doing we're going to recommend the
chairs

03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
chairs
 
03:07:42.720 --> 03:07:43.969 align:start position:0%
chairs
recess

03:07:43.969 --> 03:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
recess
 
03:07:45.830 --> 03:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
and we're going to go back and tally
 
03:07:47.570 --> 03:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
everything up and you need to leave
 
03:07:49.969 --> 03:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
Friday open basically as a potential day
 
03:07:52.309 --> 03:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
that we need to revisit depending on
 
03:07:55.130 --> 03:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
how everything shakes out and what you
 
03:07:56.990 --> 03:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
want to do at that point as a committee
 
03:07:58.790 --> 03:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's where we're at we we can't
 
03:08:01.130 --> 03:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
really offer real time how much money is
 
03:08:02.450 --> 03:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
available for division two because we
 
03:08:03.469 --> 03:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
don't know what the other two divisions
 
03:08:05.809 --> 03:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
are doing likewise for them
 
03:08:07.550 --> 03:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
this goes at one o'clock I believe on
 
03:08:08.630 --> 03:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
Friday so
 
03:08:10.849 --> 03:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
the idea would probably be at one plan
 
03:08:12.889 --> 03:08:12.899 align:start position:0%
on 10 o'clock Friday as a just in case
 
03:08:15.370 --> 03:08:15.380 align:start position:0%
and sometime tonight or tomorrow we'll
 
03:08:18.590 --> 03:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
communicate to the chairs and you can
 
03:08:20.210 --> 03:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
decide if you feel you need to come back
 
03:08:22.130 --> 03:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
in division
 
03:08:24.530 --> 03:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
that's how it works
 
03:08:24.540 --> 03:08:27.710 align:start position:0%
that's how it works
so

03:08:27.710 --> 03:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:29.809 --> 03:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh you don't have to post it this second
 
03:08:31.610 --> 03:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
so what I'll have I'll work with Janet
 
03:08:33.230 --> 03:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
to post something we can cancel it if we
 
03:08:35.410 --> 03:08:35.420 align:start position:0%
need to but we'll see
 
03:08:37.910 --> 03:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah anything we do at this point like
 
03:08:39.410 --> 03:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
says recess just in case you need to
 
03:08:42.170 --> 03:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
call the committee back okay
 
03:08:44.870 --> 03:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
but for example if you wanted to do what
 
03:08:46.429 --> 03:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
you're discussing discussing the 10
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
million and then we'll tally it up and
 
03:08:51.290 --> 03:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
if it works great if not you have to
 
03:08:52.730 --> 03:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
revisit just like any every other
 
03:08:54.170 --> 03:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
decision all three divisions have made
 
03:08:55.490 --> 03:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
to this point we can do that at the end
 
03:08:57.230 --> 03:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
of the week okay
 
03:08:59.090 --> 03:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
so there's a motion been made to
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
transfer 10 million into Highway fund
 
03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:02.630 align:start position:0%
transfer 10 million into Highway fund
yes

03:09:02.630 --> 03:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
um yes along with that motion motion
 
03:09:05.510 --> 03:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
search here I'm wearing if we should
 
03:09:09.170 --> 03:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
also authorize the
 
03:09:10.670 --> 03:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
to use
 
03:09:15.230 --> 03:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
um up to 2.5 million each year to
 
03:09:19.070 --> 03:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
to tick off items number 39 and 40 on
 
03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
I would just clarify the motion to just
 
03:09:27.469 --> 03:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate those dollars in their
 
03:09:29.330 --> 03:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
budget as requested because otherwise
 
03:09:31.070 --> 03:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
that would be a that's a whole nother
 
03:09:32.750 --> 03:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
thing to do authorizing up to a certain
 
03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
amount so if you want to if you want to
 
03:09:35.929 --> 03:09:35.939 align:start position:0%
pick those numbers or if you want to
 
03:09:37.849 --> 03:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
adjust them to a rounder number whatever
 
03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
you want to do but those are the
 
03:09:40.370 --> 03:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
requests that came in those would be in
 
03:09:42.050 --> 03:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
house bill one what are the line numbers
 
03:09:46.030 --> 03:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
again 39 and 40. thank you
 
03:09:48.830 --> 03:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
so right totally marvelous
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
where are you taking the Surplus from
 
03:09:52.389 --> 03:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
that's five minutes
 
03:09:55.130 --> 03:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
this this proposal here would be a 20
 
03:09:58.250 --> 03:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
from 23 Corporation
 
03:10:00.769 --> 03:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
will be a transfer in 23 from the
 
03:10:06.530 --> 03:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:09.309 --> 03:10:09.319 align:start position:0%
general fund to the highway fund
 
03:10:11.929 --> 03:10:11.939 align:start position:0%
so just using round numbers you'd move
 
03:10:14.090 --> 03:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
10 million in you're going to authorize
 
03:10:16.370 --> 03:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
spending of five of it and then if you
 
03:10:18.050 --> 03:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
go back to page eight that would get
 
03:10:19.849 --> 03:10:19.859 align:start position:0%
your ending Highway fund Surplus
 
03:10:21.530 --> 03:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
somewhere around the 10 to 11 million
 
03:10:21.540 --> 03:10:28.190 align:start position:0%
somewhere around the 10 to 11 million
range

03:10:28.190 --> 03:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:29.450 --> 03:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
so right now we're just talking about
 
03:10:31.370 --> 03:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
the 10 yes
 
03:10:34.429 --> 03:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
any questions on the 10
 
03:10:42.530 --> 03:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:44.510 --> 03:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
so it's seven
 
03:10:48.889 --> 03:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
one and one abstention one obvious one
 
03:10:48.899 --> 03:10:52.490 align:start position:0%
one and one abstention one obvious one
absentee

03:10:52.490 --> 03:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:55.010 --> 03:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
now if you want to take any action on
 
03:10:57.889 --> 03:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:59.809 --> 03:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
no just well we just authorized them
 
03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
they can spend that real quick they
 
03:11:05.690 --> 03:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
cannot so just a reminder the depart the
 
03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation is also
 
03:11:09.290 --> 03:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
appropriation authority to spend money
 
03:11:12.170 --> 03:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
so they don't have an open Highway fund
 
03:11:13.429 --> 03:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
whenever they want to so you have to
 
03:11:15.469 --> 03:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
authorize it correct technically you
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
would authorize this request and I would
 
03:11:20.690 --> 03:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
increase their class 30 equipment buy an
 
03:11:22.969 --> 03:11:22.979 align:start position:0%
amount however amount you pick and that
 
03:11:25.849 --> 03:11:25.859 align:start position:0%
would give them Highway funds won't you
 
03:11:26.710 --> 03:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
pick the
 
03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
amounts okay give us four four million
 
03:11:40.309 --> 03:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:40.319 --> 03:11:41.690 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:11:41.690 --> 03:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
do you have a second
 
03:11:45.830 --> 03:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:11:49.610 --> 03:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:57.889 --> 03:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.150 --> 03:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
oh well I'm assuming
 
03:12:03.710 --> 03:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have requested it in their
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
exceptional needs that if the article
 
03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
was found I'm assuming that soon yeah oh
 
03:12:13.010 --> 03:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
we've got 56 million and to confirm that
 
03:12:15.710 --> 03:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
was both lines 39 and 40. correct so
 
03:12:17.750 --> 03:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
just using just round numbers that will
 
03:12:19.670 --> 03:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
leave the highway fund and an ending
 
03:12:21.650 --> 03:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
balance at the end of fiscal 25 around
 
03:12:24.469 --> 03:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
10 or 11 million I'll shakeouts
 
03:12:26.809 --> 03:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the I want the rounding
 
03:12:28.250 --> 03:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there yeah I'll do the
 
03:12:31.429 --> 03:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:34.250 --> 03:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
okay what else Mickey I got I got one
 
03:12:38.830 --> 03:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
for a million dollars uh make that
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
motion to uh
 
03:12:45.290 --> 03:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
where does that go
 
03:12:47.570 --> 03:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
yeah Department of Safety Department of
 
03:12:50.750 --> 03:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
Safety Could you um could you help me
 
03:12:52.910 --> 03:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
with the motion the the I'd say at this
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
point with the information we have if
 
03:12:55.730 --> 03:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
this is something that the committee
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to move forward with we would
 
03:12:59.929 --> 03:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
make a one million dollar appropriation
 
03:12:59.939 --> 03:13:00.830 align:start position:0%
make a one million dollar appropriation
um

03:13:00.830 --> 03:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
and I can charge it to whichever fiscal
 
03:13:04.670 --> 03:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
year makes the most sense of as dust
 
03:13:06.950 --> 03:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
settles here uh to the Department of
 
03:13:09.170 --> 03:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
Safety for this purpose I don't know
 
03:13:10.550 --> 03:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
what it is quite yet I'll work with the
 
03:13:12.110 --> 03:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
department to get the language right to
 
03:13:14.030 --> 03:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
get the intent of this I make that
 
03:13:14.040 --> 03:13:19.269 align:start position:0%
get the intent of this I make that
motion

03:13:19.269 --> 03:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.070 --> 03:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's like a Knicks check
 
03:13:24.769 --> 03:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
at the state level because if somebody
 
03:13:26.950 --> 03:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
gets arrested let's say in Hampton
 
03:13:29.690 --> 03:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
all right all right and then they could
 
03:13:32.510 --> 03:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
drive up to Conway all right they get
 
03:13:35.630 --> 03:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
arrested again this identifies that
 
03:13:38.030 --> 03:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
they've got an arrest warrant or or
 
03:13:40.550 --> 03:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
they've benefited they're out on bail
 
03:13:42.590 --> 03:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
from the from Hampton
 
03:13:45.590 --> 03:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
so you know that's this is this is a
 
03:13:47.450 --> 03:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea because it I mean
 
03:13:47.460 --> 03:13:50.030 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea because it I mean
yeah

03:13:50.030 --> 03:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:13:54.050 --> 03:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
is that clearance the software
 
03:13:56.030 --> 03:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's a Knicks check at the
 
03:13:57.410 --> 03:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
state level
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:06.230 --> 03:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire bar of
 
03:14:08.330 --> 03:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
course I support
 
03:14:10.190 --> 03:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
um you know better communication for our
 
03:14:13.490 --> 03:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in order to you know
 
03:14:15.650 --> 03:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
better enforce
 
03:14:17.870 --> 03:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know folks who are out on bail
 
03:14:19.490 --> 03:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
across the state of course that's a
 
03:14:22.130 --> 03:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
wonderful idea and a goal we should be
 
03:14:24.830 --> 03:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
working toward but uh I would say that
 
03:14:27.290 --> 03:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
my approval is conditional upon seeing
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
the language about you know what it is
 
03:14:31.849 --> 03:14:31.859 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you know is it in
 
03:14:33.710 --> 03:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
fact do you have anything a piece of
 
03:14:35.570 --> 03:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
software or is it in fact just the
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
concept that there will be you know
 
03:14:40.429 --> 03:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
communication between state law
 
03:14:42.290 --> 03:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
enforcement I mean what are we talking
 
03:14:45.670 --> 03:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
about I think it's the question
 
03:14:50.750 --> 03:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:53.630 --> 03:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
I I haven't seen that from anybody else
 
03:14:56.330 --> 03:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
so I I thank you I take your word but I
 
03:15:00.050 --> 03:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
want to see what it is on paper I have I
 
03:15:02.510 --> 03:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
have this memo that was dropped off
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
today and I can make copies of this this
 
03:15:06.610 --> 03:15:06.620 align:start position:0%
was just given to me
 
03:15:09.290 --> 03:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
hours ago maybe or two hours ago so I
 
03:15:10.610 --> 03:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
can provide copies
 
03:15:12.650 --> 03:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh if you want to give me why don't we
 
03:15:21.130 --> 03:15:21.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:23.870 --> 03:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
any detail is Right other than that
 
03:15:28.190 --> 03:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:29.929 --> 03:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
over building a I think building
 
03:15:32.090 --> 03:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
and have we filled in all the white
 
03:15:33.530 --> 03:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
blanks here
 
03:15:35.570 --> 03:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
um did we do we decide about fish and
 
03:15:42.530 --> 03:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:45.110 --> 03:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
science professional development here
 
03:15:47.889 --> 03:15:47.899 align:start position:0%
that whole section that the governor
 
03:15:54.889 --> 03:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:54.899 --> 03:15:58.210 align:start position:0%
 
area

03:15:58.210 --> 03:15:58.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
right but we don't need money
 
03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:13.849 --> 03:16:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I think there's also an
 
03:16:18.370 --> 03:16:18.380 align:start position:0%
important discussion to be had over the
 
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account allocation of
 
03:16:23.090 --> 03:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
60 million I know that the Democratic
 
03:16:24.349 --> 03:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
caucus in the house is really
 
03:16:26.330 --> 03:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with that
 
03:16:27.950 --> 03:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I think this is an appropriate time
 
03:16:27.960 --> 03:16:29.210 align:start position:0%
um I think this is an appropriate time
to

03:16:29.210 --> 03:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:16:30.830 --> 03:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
today would also be an appropriate time
 
03:16:34.969 --> 03:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:36.650 --> 03:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
well he's making copies would you like
 
03:16:39.769 --> 03:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:39.779 --> 03:16:40.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:16:40.490 --> 03:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
I know that there are members of our
 
03:16:45.590 --> 03:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
caucus who believe that this
 
03:16:48.230 --> 03:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
increase to 60 million over the biennium
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
for the education Freedom accounts is a
 
03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
non-starter item for voting for the
 
03:16:52.560 --> 03:16:53.690 align:start position:0%
non-starter item for voting for the
budget

03:16:53.690 --> 03:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:16:53.700 --> 03:16:54.290 align:start position:0%
budget
um

03:16:54.290 --> 03:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:56.450 --> 03:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
you know we have Phil philosophical
 
03:16:57.769 --> 03:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
differences of course between our
 
03:16:59.809 --> 03:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
parties about you know
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
the purpose is an intent and you know
 
03:17:04.010 --> 03:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
funding sources for this
 
03:17:04.020 --> 03:17:05.150 align:start position:0%
funding sources for this
um

03:17:05.150 --> 03:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:08.150 --> 03:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
I know that in addition to that just
 
03:17:09.769 --> 03:17:09.779 align:start position:0%
general dollar amount that people object
 
03:17:12.349 --> 03:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
to there's also great concern about
 
03:17:14.809 --> 03:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
um the 10 overhead that's going to this
 
03:17:16.010 --> 03:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
third party
 
03:17:18.050 --> 03:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
that is making a profit from this as
 
03:17:20.809 --> 03:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
well as um you know the the guard rails
 
03:17:22.849 --> 03:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
on accountability for you know where
 
03:17:25.130 --> 03:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
that money is going and safety concerns
 
03:17:26.990 --> 03:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
as well that representative Heath has
 
03:17:29.870 --> 03:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
brought up so I I know this is a
 
03:17:32.150 --> 03:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
a very difficult subject for our caucus
 
03:17:36.769 --> 03:17:36.779 align:start position:0%
and I think you know if you're intending
 
03:17:39.650 --> 03:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
if your caucus is intending to push that
 
03:17:41.090 --> 03:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
across the line I know that's going to
 
03:17:43.849 --> 03:17:43.859 align:start position:0%
be very difficult just on that principle
 
03:17:45.969 --> 03:17:45.979 align:start position:0%
Point alone so
 
03:17:48.889 --> 03:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
my My Hope Is that we would be able to
 
03:17:52.190 --> 03:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
you know reduce the overall allocation
 
03:17:54.530 --> 03:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
for the two-year biennium and to
 
03:17:57.410 --> 03:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
possibly consider putting that overflow
 
03:17:59.750 --> 03:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
into school school building Aid which I
 
03:18:01.610 --> 03:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
know is also a very difficult subject at
 
03:18:04.010 --> 03:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
the moment but um you know I think
 
03:18:05.389 --> 03:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
they're the
 
03:18:08.510 --> 03:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
the moratorium has put so many districts
 
03:18:10.969 --> 03:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
in line for that school building Aid
 
03:18:12.889 --> 03:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
that they're really fighting for and
 
03:18:16.490 --> 03:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
hoping for and um I think you know in
 
03:18:18.050 --> 03:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
terms of benefiting kids across the
 
03:18:18.060 --> 03:18:19.429 align:start position:0%
terms of benefiting kids across the
state

03:18:19.429 --> 03:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:18:21.410 --> 03:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
um that could be a wonderful opportunity
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
to compromise to try to find people on
 
03:18:26.750 --> 03:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle to try to move
 
03:18:28.969 --> 03:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
the ball forward so that would be my my
 
03:18:30.950 --> 03:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion for an opening
 
03:18:39.349 --> 03:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:42.590 --> 03:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
um I I have heard amounts floated I my
 
03:18:44.269 --> 03:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
personal preference with the seat would
 
03:18:46.130 --> 03:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
be to see not a single dollar go into
 
03:18:47.870 --> 03:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
the educational Freedom account which I
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
know is a non-starter for your caucus so
 
03:18:50.880 --> 03:18:52.250 align:start position:0%
know is a non-starter for your caucus so
um

03:18:52.250 --> 03:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:53.750 --> 03:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I've also heard
 
03:18:53.760 --> 03:18:54.349 align:start position:0%
um I've also heard
um

03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:56.570 --> 03:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
like a 10 million dollar reduction in
 
03:18:59.870 --> 03:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
the overall funding per year to be
 
03:18:59.880 --> 03:19:00.950 align:start position:0%
the overall funding per year to be
allocated

03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
03:19:04.490 --> 03:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
across to the building age so 20 total
 
03:19:14.809 --> 03:19:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:22.490 --> 03:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:29.090 --> 03:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:29.100 --> 03:19:39.969 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:19:39.969 --> 03:19:39.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:43.429 --> 03:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the motion it was just okay
 
03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
we'll interrupt that discussion then
 
03:19:47.929 --> 03:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
to take a moment to read this and see if
 
03:19:49.370 --> 03:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
we can
 
03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:15.180 --> 03:20:22.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:20:22.849 --> 03:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:25.190 --> 03:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
so where does the million come in here
 
03:20:27.469 --> 03:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
because on here I'm looking at 181
 
03:20:28.790 --> 03:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
million and I'm not sure what that's
 
03:20:31.070 --> 03:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
going to and then it was probably not
 
03:20:32.269 --> 03:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
going to have the thing on the back
 
03:20:32.279 --> 03:20:34.010 align:start position:0%
going to have the thing on the back
about

03:20:34.010 --> 03:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:20:35.929 --> 03:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
some customers may not have internet
 
03:20:37.790 --> 03:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
connection at all and what's needed to
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
develop this I'm not can someone connect
 
03:20:41.929 --> 03:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
this with the million dollars page two
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
on the bottom
 
03:20:46.490 --> 03:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
you got the whole thing thank you
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
potential legislative funding it's one
 
03:20:48.479 --> 03:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
potential legislative funding it's one
million

03:20:59.750 --> 03:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.760 --> 03:21:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:07.790 --> 03:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
oh there it is right here it's on the
 
03:21:14.650 --> 03:21:14.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:14.660 --> 03:21:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
breakdown

03:21:16.309 --> 03:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
breakdown
 
03:21:16.319 --> 03:21:19.309 align:start position:0%
breakdown
wow

03:21:19.309 --> 03:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:25.670 --> 03:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:25.680 --> 03:21:34.190 align:start position:0%
 
benefits

03:21:34.190 --> 03:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:36.830 --> 03:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
so this is currently a project for the
 
03:21:40.610 --> 03:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:42.950 --> 03:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm like I'm like a page two
 
03:21:45.650 --> 03:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
solution technology paragraph and it
 
03:21:48.050 --> 03:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
talks about the spots configuration
 
03:21:50.450 --> 03:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
which is a current system it sounds like
 
03:21:53.750 --> 03:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
they basically need to
 
03:21:56.450 --> 03:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
create a new query function
 
03:21:59.090 --> 03:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
that would allow vendors
 
03:22:00.170 --> 03:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
will the vendor would have to create
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
this interface so that it would allow
 
03:22:02.990 --> 03:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
the information to transfer from the
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
agency to these spots
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
and seamless connection so it sounds
 
03:22:12.650 --> 03:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
according to that paragraph
 
03:22:18.650 --> 03:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
tier we don't really have an we have a
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
chair Weiler came in and explained this
 
03:22:23.690 --> 03:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
sort of but we really don't have a
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
proposal from the Department or anything
 
03:22:27.530 --> 03:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
I did do some really uncomfortable
 
03:22:29.450 --> 03:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
funding a million dollars to something
 
03:22:32.590 --> 03:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
that just it kind of came off the cuff
 
03:22:34.670 --> 03:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
and we really don't know what it's about
 
03:22:38.269 --> 03:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know I just I'm not comfortable
 
03:22:46.490 --> 03:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:48.830 --> 03:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm trying to read this and I kind
 
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
of seconded I suspect that this is
 
03:22:52.849 --> 03:22:52.859 align:start position:0%
understandable but again I have to
 
03:22:54.469 --> 03:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
object that we're bringing stuff in at
 
03:22:55.610 --> 03:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
the last minute we're supposed to be
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
finishing stuff and we've had several
 
03:22:59.870 --> 03:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
new things come in and
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
why in the world this couldn't have been
 
03:23:04.309 --> 03:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
part of the entire process I just don't
 
03:23:05.750 --> 03:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
know I mean it just seems incredibly
 
03:23:08.630 --> 03:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
disorganized and as I said process I
 
03:23:11.630 --> 03:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
object to having things you know
 
03:23:13.790 --> 03:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
placed in front of us
 
03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
um without any anyone here to speak
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:21.889 --> 03:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
I mean it wasn't in the police
 
03:23:25.429 --> 03:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
State Police presentation at any across
 
03:23:25.439 --> 03:23:26.570 align:start position:0%
State Police presentation at any across
the

03:23:26.570 --> 03:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:23:28.729 --> 03:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering I'm safe you didn't
 
03:23:31.610 --> 03:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
bring it up yeah so that's my concern
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
now is like um
 
03:23:36.170 --> 03:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
if this is a critical item it seems like
 
03:23:37.849 --> 03:23:37.859 align:start position:0%
they would have built that into their
 
03:23:37.859 --> 03:23:39.830 align:start position:0%
they would have built that into their
process

03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:23:42.050 --> 03:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
I think also they're not here to comment
 
03:23:43.729 --> 03:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
on that right now so that also makes me
 
03:23:47.389 --> 03:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
a little concerned I think the chair
 
03:23:49.630 --> 03:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
was solicited by
 
03:23:52.610 --> 03:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
criminal justice pure criminal justice
 
03:23:57.610 --> 03:23:57.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:01.190 --> 03:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
criminal justice is not us
 
03:24:03.469 --> 03:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
so or the money with the money
 
03:24:07.210 --> 03:24:07.220 align:start position:0%
it is is this Appropriations in here for
 
03:24:09.530 --> 03:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
440 million
 
03:24:12.590 --> 03:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
what is that I think they're just
 
03:24:14.030 --> 03:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the one million that's at the
 
03:24:16.150 --> 03:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
bottom of page two
 
03:24:17.809 --> 03:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
03:24:19.969 --> 03:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
but this isn't cut this is coming at the
 
03:24:21.710 --> 03:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
last minute it's not coming from safety
 
03:24:30.070 --> 03:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:34.670 --> 03:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
this 440 million dollars in here is that
 
03:24:38.990 --> 03:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:46.130 --> 03:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:51.349 --> 03:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:53.870 --> 03:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
can I can I ask Nikki a question
 
03:24:55.969 --> 03:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
is there a mechanism for bringing this
 
03:24:57.710 --> 03:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
in through fiscal or through some other
 
03:24:59.990 --> 03:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism because I mean I'm really just
 
03:25:02.450 --> 03:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
can't go there at this date without any
 
03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge here
 
03:25:06.590 --> 03:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh no safety has authority to come to
 
03:25:09.590 --> 03:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal for Highway funds so
 
03:25:12.050 --> 03:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
unless it was this that face value
 
03:25:13.550 --> 03:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like it's an exclusive
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
Highway fund
 
03:25:17.090 --> 03:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh item so I'm not sure they would have
 
03:25:19.610 --> 03:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
the authority to do this through fiscal
 
03:25:19.620 --> 03:25:21.050 align:start position:0%
the authority to do this through fiscal
um

03:25:21.050 --> 03:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
and I don't have any other information
 
03:25:23.570 --> 03:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
on this I did reach out to the
 
03:25:25.370 --> 03:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
department and they didn't know
 
03:25:26.750 --> 03:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think really what I was talking
 
03:25:28.190 --> 03:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
about when I asked them about it so I'm
 
03:25:29.809 --> 03:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
not sure that this has been presented to
 
03:25:32.330 --> 03:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
them at this point they were going to
 
03:25:34.309 --> 03:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
look into it and this was an hour ago so
 
03:25:37.070 --> 03:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
I I haven't had a response yet
 
03:25:40.490 --> 03:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
let me let me talk to the chair uh and
 
03:25:42.590 --> 03:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
see if he wants to come say some
 
03:25:44.510 --> 03:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
supporting words because this was his
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:12.530 --> 03:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:15.349 --> 03:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
better than what it's this this says 440
 
03:26:17.510 --> 03:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars no that's uh it's in
 
03:26:18.889 --> 03:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
here I don't know right right here is
 
03:26:22.070 --> 03:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
what you want to be reading this is
 
03:26:25.250 --> 03:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
on this page uh back to page back page
 
03:26:25.260 --> 03:26:29.269 align:start position:0%
on this page uh back to page back page
backup

03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:32.150 --> 03:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
and trading there and in anticipation of
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
the separate Advanced State Police has
 
03:26:36.110 --> 03:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
asked our Sports vendor along with
 
03:26:40.190 --> 03:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
all RMS vendors to submit a quote
 
03:26:42.410 --> 03:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
to show the load indicator attachment
 
03:26:46.729 --> 03:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:48.530 --> 03:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
New York State Police could not be
 
03:26:48.540 --> 03:26:51.290 align:start position:0%
New York State Police could not be
soliciting

03:26:51.290 --> 03:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
soliciting
 
03:26:53.809 --> 03:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
over this aspect of services our current
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
spot Defender interface
 
03:26:58.610 --> 03:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
see they they've already they already
 
03:26:59.809 --> 03:26:59.819 align:start position:0%
have some
 
03:27:04.130 --> 03:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:08.450 --> 03:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:11.030 --> 03:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
you read this right here
 
03:27:14.330 --> 03:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
yeah no I've read it you could take that
 
03:27:27.830 --> 03:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:30.710 --> 03:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh this just came
 
03:27:33.050 --> 03:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
to me as I was walking in here with my
 
03:27:35.389 --> 03:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
other amendment I had a brief discussion
 
03:27:37.790 --> 03:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
with chairman Roy
 
03:27:41.750 --> 03:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
and it made a lot of sense that if
 
03:27:45.590 --> 03:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
someone gets arrested bailed out
 
03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
and then runs away and starts another
 
03:27:50.570 --> 03:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
crime people the second group or the
 
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
third group that arrests him has no clue
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
that he's already been bailed
 
03:27:58.729 --> 03:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
and obviously he's he's already
 
03:28:02.269 --> 03:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
violated his bail conditions so that
 
03:28:04.729 --> 03:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
would add further to his crime and he
 
03:28:07.309 --> 03:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
should not be bailed again but that is
 
03:28:09.170 --> 03:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
likely to happen and if we're going to
 
03:28:11.389 --> 03:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
keep these criminals off the street that
 
03:28:13.729 --> 03:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
03:28:13.739 --> 03:28:14.330 align:start position:0%
continue to
um

03:28:14.330 --> 03:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:17.389 --> 03:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
break the law then this seemed like a
 
03:28:19.610 --> 03:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
good thing for a million dollars they
 
03:28:22.849 --> 03:28:22.859 align:start position:0%
have to go back to their providers of
 
03:28:26.990 --> 03:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
their uh and their system and
 
03:28:29.090 --> 03:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
put a million dollars up to get this
 
03:28:31.370 --> 03:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
patch so that everybody then law
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement will know
 
03:28:36.170 --> 03:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
by looking up who's been arrested who's
 
03:28:38.809 --> 03:28:38.819 align:start position:0%
been bailed how did they get here
 
03:28:42.050 --> 03:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking this is worthy of a
 
03:28:44.269 --> 03:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars and I think we have the
 
03:28:46.670 --> 03:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
money now to put this million dollars
 
03:28:50.510 --> 03:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
into a very useful program that will as
 
03:28:52.429 --> 03:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
crime is getting rampant in the streets
 
03:28:55.790 --> 03:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
we need to do something so I'm moving
 
03:28:59.150 --> 03:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
that this should be adopted thank you
 
03:29:01.010 --> 03:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:29:01.020 --> 03:29:02.450 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

03:29:02.450 --> 03:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
the uh is this part of the Nyx system or
 
03:29:08.809 --> 03:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
Nick's reporting which which identifies
 
03:29:11.870 --> 03:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah it talks about the ncic unit
 
03:29:13.729 --> 03:29:13.739 align:start position:0%
makes centralized crime data immediately
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
available to criminal justice agencies
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
and and the reason they're not
 
03:29:17.520 --> 03:29:19.309 align:start position:0%
and and the reason they're not
soliciting

03:29:19.309 --> 03:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
soliciting
 
03:29:23.630 --> 03:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
a second or RFP is because they already
 
03:29:25.849 --> 03:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
the system's already in place this is
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
just an addition yeah this is this is so
 
03:29:31.370 --> 03:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
it'd be a little bit quicker
 
03:29:37.010 --> 03:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:39.469 --> 03:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you Mr chair thank
 
03:29:42.229 --> 03:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for taking my question so I
 
03:29:45.950 --> 03:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear on this um that um
 
03:29:48.889 --> 03:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
the chair of Criminal Justice
 
03:29:53.030 --> 03:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
Terry Roy asked for this
 
03:29:55.370 --> 03:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
um did he coordinate at all with the
 
03:29:55.380 --> 03:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
um did he coordinate at all with the
safety

03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
safety
 
03:29:59.150 --> 03:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
um does he know whether or not this
 
03:30:02.389 --> 03:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
works has there been any background does
 
03:30:05.330 --> 03:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
this department of safety want this
 
03:30:07.550 --> 03:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's what's the head
 
03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
letter there it works as a second page
 
03:30:13.490 --> 03:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police
 
03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
support's continued efforts in ensuring
 
03:30:16.910 --> 03:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
all law enforcement in the field have
 
03:30:18.530 --> 03:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
Reliable Tools
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
then they go on and on about that
 
03:30:22.729 --> 03:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:30:25.429 --> 03:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
Justice information Bureau I talk about
 
03:30:25.439 --> 03:30:27.170 align:start position:0%
Justice information Bureau I talk about
ncic

03:30:27.170 --> 03:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
ncic
 
03:30:28.910 --> 03:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
and spots
 
03:30:31.070 --> 03:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
does not have a mechanism in place to
 
03:30:32.570 --> 03:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
receive and or share with law
 
03:30:34.969 --> 03:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency bail conditions on
 
03:30:37.010 --> 03:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
any New Hampshire citizen in real time
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
or efficient capacity currently law
 
03:30:41.870 --> 03:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies need to contact the
 
03:30:44.570 --> 03:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
issuing Agency on the courts directly to
 
03:30:46.130 --> 03:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
obtain any bail condition information
 
03:30:48.410 --> 03:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
this information may not be provided in
 
03:30:50.750 --> 03:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
a timely manner resulting in the agency
 
03:30:52.670 --> 03:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
foregoing the request prior to
 
03:30:55.070 --> 03:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
interacting with any individuals the
 
03:30:56.929 --> 03:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
inability for law enforcement agents to
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
ascertain agents to ascertain the
 
03:31:00.769 --> 03:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
potential conditions of an individual's
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
bail condition can present a public
 
03:31:05.210 --> 03:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
safety risk if the agent is not able to
 
03:31:07.309 --> 03:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
ascertain any potential level of risk
 
03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
and or violation that could be presented
 
03:31:12.410 --> 03:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
during an interaction implementing these
 
03:31:14.090 --> 03:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
updates will allow law enforcement
 
03:31:15.769 --> 03:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
agencies to send and receive information
 
03:31:18.650 --> 03:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
via spots thus contributing to our
 
03:31:20.150 --> 03:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
continuous effort to provide an
 
03:31:21.950 --> 03:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
Innovative accessible data exchange
 
03:31:24.349 --> 03:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
platform that can benefit agencies and
 
03:31:27.170 --> 03:31:27.180 align:start position:0%
reduce the risk to Public Safety but Mr
 
03:31:28.790 --> 03:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
chair this has been from our new
 
03:31:32.830 --> 03:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:37.969 --> 03:31:37.979 align:start position:0%
nhsb is yeah no excuse me this is an RFP
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
request for proposal and it's put forth
 
03:31:42.290 --> 03:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
by one network environment for justice
 
03:31:43.729 --> 03:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
this is not coming from the Department
 
03:31:46.610 --> 03:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
of Safety this is an RFP that these
 
03:31:48.530 --> 03:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
people are these this is an organization
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's looking for money to do this but
 
03:31:51.950 --> 03:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know anything that the
 
03:31:53.570 --> 03:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
department of safety has said yes this
 
03:31:55.370 --> 03:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
is a direction in which we want to go
 
03:31:57.229 --> 03:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
and what's missing for me is the
 
03:31:58.910 --> 03:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety saying we would
 
03:32:01.309 --> 03:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
like to contract with these people
 
03:32:04.969 --> 03:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
and this is an RFP from um I suppose a
 
03:32:06.710 --> 03:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
pseudo private or public kind of a
 
03:32:09.290 --> 03:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
company and I think it's really weird
 
03:32:12.110 --> 03:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
that we would fund an RFP for an
 
03:32:13.969 --> 03:32:13.979 align:start position:0%
organization that has not come to us and
 
03:32:16.370 --> 03:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
said yes we actually would like this
 
03:32:19.190 --> 03:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
I mean I can't I'm it's I just can't go
 
03:32:20.570 --> 03:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
there sorry
 
03:32:23.750 --> 03:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
I guess this came late to uh
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
to the criminal justice committee and
 
03:32:28.370 --> 03:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
they thought well gee we're working on
 
03:32:30.229 --> 03:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
the budget maybe we got time to put this
 
03:32:32.210 --> 03:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
in so
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
as far as I knew from from
 
03:32:36.530 --> 03:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
this had been presented by the state
 
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
police or some police agency so this was
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
the paperwork that he had
 
03:32:48.410 --> 03:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
which which kind of spelled it out so
 
03:32:48.420 --> 03:32:49.670 align:start position:0%
which which kind of spelled it out so
yes

03:32:49.670 --> 03:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:32:54.710 --> 03:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:57.950 --> 03:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
saying that that um this this tool would
 
03:32:59.690 --> 03:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
be a wonderful benefit to the state if
 
03:33:01.490 --> 03:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
enacted I think
 
03:33:04.729 --> 03:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
um for me I do have two lingering
 
03:33:06.830 --> 03:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
questions though about
 
03:33:09.170 --> 03:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
um the program itself so one I'd like to
 
03:33:11.809 --> 03:33:11.819 align:start position:0%
know how many arrests in the state of
 
03:33:14.210 --> 03:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire happen after a bailout
 
03:33:16.429 --> 03:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
violation so I'd like to know the like
 
03:33:18.950 --> 03:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
what quantity of dual arrests are we
 
03:33:21.309 --> 03:33:21.319 align:start position:0%
talking about is this a significant
 
03:33:24.050 --> 03:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
problem in the state that warrants a
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
million dollar allocation the second
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
question I I'm asking just is being
 
03:33:31.550 --> 03:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with a criminal justice system
 
03:33:33.710 --> 03:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
and um the court system in the state of
 
03:33:35.929 --> 03:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is will an increased
 
03:33:39.229 --> 03:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
reporting time from the moment of the
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
Dual arrest the second bail violation
 
03:33:41.279 --> 03:33:43.130 align:start position:0%
Dual arrest the second bail violation
arrest

03:33:43.130 --> 03:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
03:33:45.469 --> 03:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
um that point in time be sped out from
 
03:33:47.090 --> 03:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
the court procedure time when a
 
03:33:47.100 --> 03:33:48.110 align:start position:0%
the court procedure time when a
magistrate

03:33:48.110 --> 03:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
magistrate
 
03:33:50.210 --> 03:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
looks into the cork system and realizes
 
03:33:52.190 --> 03:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
that this name is already existing on a
 
03:33:53.809 --> 03:33:53.819 align:start position:0%
public Docket in a different part of our
 
03:33:56.510 --> 03:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
state if that Delta in time just
 
03:33:58.370 --> 03:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
speeding up that process of notification
 
03:34:00.290 --> 03:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
to the second you know to the second
 
03:34:02.929 --> 03:34:02.939 align:start position:0%
arrest in law enforcement body
 
03:34:05.690 --> 03:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
if that makes a significant difference
 
03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
and the increased safety of New
 
03:34:07.560 --> 03:34:08.750 align:start position:0%
and the increased safety of New
Hampshire

03:34:08.750 --> 03:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:34:08.760 --> 03:34:09.710 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

03:34:09.710 --> 03:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:11.630 --> 03:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
you know Granite Staters across our
 
03:34:14.450 --> 03:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
communities so while I understand that
 
03:34:16.250 --> 03:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
it of course is important for law
 
03:34:18.110 --> 03:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement to understand that this is a
 
03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
second violation as soon as possible I
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
know that that
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
piece of information comes to light in
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
the court system further down the road
 
03:34:29.450 --> 03:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
my question is just by bumping up that
 
03:34:31.849 --> 03:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
timeline does it actually make us safer
 
03:34:33.769 --> 03:34:33.779 align:start position:0%
as a state to allocate another million
 
03:34:33.779 --> 03:34:34.849 align:start position:0%
as a state to allocate another million
dollars

03:34:34.849 --> 03:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:34:39.290 --> 03:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
um to that effort and you know my my
 
03:34:41.570 --> 03:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
and just hearing myself ask that
 
03:34:43.309 --> 03:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
question out loud I realized
 
03:34:45.410 --> 03:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
um I think it doesn't and the reason why
 
03:34:46.849 --> 03:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
I say that is because the second
 
03:34:48.650 --> 03:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
violation has already taken place and
 
03:34:51.410 --> 03:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
that person is already in custody
 
03:34:53.530 --> 03:34:53.540 align:start position:0%
um so I think if we're talking about
 
03:34:55.670 --> 03:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
million dollar here a million dollars
 
03:34:57.769 --> 03:34:57.779 align:start position:0%
there down the road
 
03:35:00.229 --> 03:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
um across the important functions that
 
03:35:01.610 --> 03:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
we are looking at
 
03:35:03.469 --> 03:35:03.479 align:start position:0%
in the state that that million dollars
 
03:35:05.870 --> 03:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
could be better served elsewhere I think
 
03:35:08.570 --> 03:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
a good counter argument to that very
 
03:35:10.309 --> 03:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
point would to be have the department of
 
03:35:12.530 --> 03:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
safety here and putting it in their
 
03:35:14.030 --> 03:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
process saying that this million dollars
 
03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
is an important allocation but we're
 
03:35:17.690 --> 03:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
missing that we're missing that key
 
03:35:20.269 --> 03:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
ingredient and I again would just like
 
03:35:22.309 --> 03:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
to say I think the process that we have
 
03:35:24.650 --> 03:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
undergone up to this point has been
 
03:35:26.990 --> 03:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
methodological or methodological for
 
03:35:29.450 --> 03:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
every department and the mere Factor
 
03:35:31.309 --> 03:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's coming to us late not from the
 
03:35:32.929 --> 03:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety itself tells me
 
03:35:34.610 --> 03:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
that this is not a priority of theirs
 
03:35:37.130 --> 03:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
and that you know while this is an
 
03:35:39.229 --> 03:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
interesting discussion for future
 
03:35:41.510 --> 03:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
bienniums and you know I'd love to hear
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
the department of safety weigh on weigh
 
03:35:45.229 --> 03:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
in on this I don't think this is where
 
03:35:46.729 --> 03:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
the last million dollars we should be
 
03:35:48.830 --> 03:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
determining goes today
 
03:35:51.290 --> 03:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
I'll see if I can get the chairman here
 
03:35:53.570 --> 03:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
to tell us what prompted this with him
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure he's had more experience
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
than the rest of us with how frequently
 
03:36:01.250 --> 03:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
this occurs I'll see if I can find him
 
03:36:03.950 --> 03:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
to to give us a little more data okay
 
03:36:05.570 --> 03:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
we've got some other things to do all
 
03:36:06.830 --> 03:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
right you've got other things to do but
 
03:36:10.610 --> 03:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:12.769 --> 03:36:12.779 align:start position:0%
now we'll jump back to
 
03:36:18.650 --> 03:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
and so you we were talking about Freedom
 
03:36:21.359 --> 03:36:24.710 align:start position:0%
and so you we were talking about Freedom
accounts

03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:26.690 --> 03:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
that had you exhausted your I
 
03:36:30.050 --> 03:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:32.750 --> 03:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think
 
03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
I think um my
 
03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
been exhausted I think that
 
03:36:40.070 --> 03:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
I know for our caucus that uh you know
 
03:36:43.370 --> 03:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
if everything else in the budget was a
 
03:36:44.809 --> 03:36:44.819 align:start position:0%
nice compromise and everyone was feeling
 
03:36:46.670 --> 03:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
good about it they still would be stuck
 
03:36:48.530 --> 03:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
on this point
 
03:36:48.540 --> 03:36:49.849 align:start position:0%
on this point
um

03:36:49.849 --> 03:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:52.670 --> 03:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I think that this is a good I think
 
03:36:53.929 --> 03:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:36:55.969 --> 03:36:55.979 align:start position:0%
when all is said and done through the
 
03:36:58.130 --> 03:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
process especially as we finish today
 
03:37:00.769 --> 03:37:00.779 align:start position:0%
and move into you know Friday's final
 
03:37:00.779 --> 03:37:02.450 align:start position:0%
and move into you know Friday's final
determinations

03:37:02.450 --> 03:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
determinations
 
03:37:05.750 --> 03:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know I think a very positive message
 
03:37:08.269 --> 03:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
to send to our to both sides of the
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
aisle who will be making these ultimate
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
determinations is that you know you
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
understand that our caucus is not
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the efas and that your
 
03:37:19.309 --> 03:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
caucus wants to increase it by 100 of
 
03:37:20.809 --> 03:37:20.819 align:start position:0%
the current funding level
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I I would say you know the way to
 
03:37:25.250 --> 03:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
find a compromise
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
from those two you know eras the Deltas
 
03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
to reduce it by 50 so that's where I
 
03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
have heard this number circulating
 
03:37:34.080 --> 03:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
have heard this number circulating
um

03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
for the the 20 million over the two
 
03:37:40.250 --> 03:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
years so it's like 10. of each of the
 
03:37:42.590 --> 03:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
biennium each Year's in the biennium to
 
03:37:45.889 --> 03:37:45.899 align:start position:0%
reduce the funding funding increase and
 
03:37:49.070 --> 03:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
use my suggestion is to use that Delta
 
03:37:50.570 --> 03:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
and put it into school building age
 
03:37:53.210 --> 03:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
which we understand has been another
 
03:37:55.490 --> 03:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
important point of discussion for this
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
committee for several weeks so
 
03:37:59.330 --> 03:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
that that was my suggestion in the
 
03:38:01.490 --> 03:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
second half of the conversation
 
03:38:03.469 --> 03:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
okay I would like to address one one
 
03:38:07.070 --> 03:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
part and that is the 10 percent
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
I queried that to say that's a lot of
 
03:38:10.080 --> 03:38:11.210 align:start position:0%
I queried that to say that's a lot of
money

03:38:11.210 --> 03:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:38:15.530 --> 03:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
and what happens is the managing uh
 
03:38:19.070 --> 03:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
entity of this of these funds
 
03:38:20.750 --> 03:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember how many people I
 
03:38:23.630 --> 03:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
think they said 12 they had 12 people
 
03:38:26.750 --> 03:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
they have to account to the
 
03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
for their time
 
03:38:30.290 --> 03:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
to administer
 
03:38:32.809 --> 03:38:32.819 align:start position:0%
anything that they don't cons that they
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
don't have billable time for
 
03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
flows to the fund itself it's not like
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
they keep all 10 the 10 the 10 percent
 
03:38:45.530 --> 03:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
is is a budgetary number
 
03:38:48.349 --> 03:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
but they flow a lot more of the money
 
03:38:48.359 --> 03:38:49.910 align:start position:0%
but they flow a lot more of the money
to

03:38:49.910 --> 03:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:38:52.910 --> 03:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
the program then
 
03:38:54.650 --> 03:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
90 percent
 
03:38:58.670 --> 03:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:58.680 --> 03:39:00.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
based on that
 
03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
could we
 
03:39:06.050 --> 03:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
I've been long concerned about the 10 I
 
03:39:09.290 --> 03:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
think there was a factor built in it was
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
a startup cost the 10 percent
 
03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
I'd be very comfortable if we could move
 
03:39:17.690 --> 03:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
that down to seven percent
 
03:39:21.229 --> 03:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:24.170 --> 03:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
well this is amazing but on one hand
 
03:39:25.429 --> 03:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
we've got all the details on the other
 
03:39:27.889 --> 03:39:27.899 align:start position:0%
hand we we don't know all the details
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
yes chairman Roy on speaker can I put
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
him up so we can answer any questions
 
03:39:35.150 --> 03:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
sure if you just hold the phone by the
 
03:39:35.160 --> 03:39:38.630 align:start position:0%
sure if you just hold the phone by the
mic

03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:42.050 --> 03:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself Jim go turn it on
 
03:39:42.060 --> 03:39:44.330 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself Jim go turn it on
Mike

03:39:44.330 --> 03:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
representative 31.
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
what other questions we'd like chairman
 
03:39:53.690 --> 03:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
Roy to answer
 
03:39:53.700 --> 03:39:54.650 align:start position:0%
Roy to answer
question

03:39:54.650 --> 03:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:39:54.660 --> 03:39:56.150 align:start position:0%
question
is

03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:39:59.690 --> 03:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
n't a safety requesting this request
 
03:39:59.700 --> 03:40:02.050 align:start position:0%
n't a safety requesting this request
yes

03:40:02.050 --> 03:40:02.060 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:40:03.769 --> 03:40:03.779 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:40:06.110 --> 03:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
um with that why didn't they include
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
that in their budget request to uh
 
03:40:11.870 --> 03:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
division two
 
03:40:11.880 --> 03:40:13.670 align:start position:0%
division two
because

03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
um during the course of my duties as
 
03:40:18.710 --> 03:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
chairman of Criminal Justice I was
 
03:40:21.769 --> 03:40:21.779 align:start position:0%
considering numerous bail reform bills
 
03:40:24.410 --> 03:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
and as part of that I started
 
03:40:26.570 --> 03:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
researching into the cause of some of
 
03:40:29.090 --> 03:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
the problems with regards to bail
 
03:40:31.190 --> 03:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners bailing people out who are
 
03:40:32.809 --> 03:40:32.819 align:start position:0%
already on bail
 
03:40:35.990 --> 03:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
and it came to light that they have no
 
03:40:38.150 --> 03:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
way of knowing if somebody is already on
 
03:40:38.160 --> 03:40:39.229 align:start position:0%
way of knowing if somebody is already on
bail

03:40:39.229 --> 03:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
bail
 
03:40:41.450 --> 03:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
so we did the research and what we
 
03:40:44.030 --> 03:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
determined is if someone is arrested in
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
one town it can take sometimes up to a
 
03:40:49.190 --> 03:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
month for the paperwork to get to the
 
03:40:51.410 --> 03:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
court and be processed if
 
03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
the support system is entirely paper
 
03:40:53.040 --> 03:40:54.290 align:start position:0%
the support system is entirely paper
driven

03:40:54.290 --> 03:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
driven
 
03:41:02.690 --> 03:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:04.490 --> 03:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have no way of knowing
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
someone who they are about to bail is
 
03:41:09.650 --> 03:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
already out on bail on another charge
 
03:41:12.349 --> 03:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
so it's my belief that they didn't even
 
03:41:14.210 --> 03:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
know themselves the scope of the problem
 
03:41:16.429 --> 03:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
they had
 
03:41:18.110 --> 03:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
until we did this research and
 
03:41:22.370 --> 03:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
further questions sir thank you Mr chair
 
03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
so um representative or chairman Roy
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is representative hackenfelps I am
 
03:41:31.330 --> 03:41:31.340 align:start position:0%
a member of the New Hampshire Bar
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
Association and it's my understanding
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
that once a arrest has been
 
03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh made and uh
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
potential alleged criminal has been
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
booked that the electronic system in the
 
03:41:51.290 --> 03:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
state the court system will make a note
 
03:41:54.429 --> 03:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
of that name of that person
 
03:41:56.990 --> 03:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
and then you know
 
03:41:59.389 --> 03:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
when they are in front of a magistrate
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
or a judge or any sort of criminal
 
03:42:05.450 --> 03:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
proceeding takes place the formal record
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
is then
 
03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
um capable of seeing within the system
 
03:42:12.050 --> 03:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
cross state whether or not there is
 
03:42:14.510 --> 03:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
other pending litigation you know
 
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
against this against this person if
 
03:42:19.610 --> 03:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
there are other charges in the system so
 
03:42:22.910 --> 03:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
my question is if we're what is the
 
03:42:22.920 --> 03:42:24.349 align:start position:0%
my question is if we're what is the
increased

03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
increased
 
03:42:27.229 --> 03:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
safety mechanism for the state to have
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
that information earlier than the point
 
03:42:31.849 --> 03:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
of the second arrest
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
then at the point that the court system
 
03:42:36.950 --> 03:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
entry is made the second time so I'm not
 
03:42:39.410 --> 03:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
sure that there is any value to the
 
03:42:42.110 --> 03:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
safety in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:42:44.389 --> 03:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
by having this information faster than
 
03:42:46.370 --> 03:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
the court entry system that already
 
03:42:48.410 --> 03:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
takes place and is in
 
03:42:50.210 --> 03:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
you know part of the processes of the
 
03:42:53.990 --> 03:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
she's saying that
 
03:42:55.920 --> 03:42:56.510 align:start position:0%
she's saying that
um

03:42:56.510 --> 03:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
she doesn't think it's good it's still
 
03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
no I hear you fine all right she's
 
03:43:08.090 --> 03:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
saying that is this a big Improvement in
 
03:43:10.729 --> 03:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
the speed of how quick it would take she
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
feels that once it's gone into the
 
03:43:14.750 --> 03:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
system they should be able to access it
 
03:43:17.090 --> 03:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
quickly I think you need to tell her how
 
03:43:20.630 --> 03:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
lengthy that time is for it to get to
 
03:43:23.570 --> 03:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
the second arrest person
 
03:43:26.570 --> 03:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
yeah so currently if someone is arrested
 
03:43:28.849 --> 03:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
and booked and it gets to the court it
 
03:43:30.410 --> 03:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
can take weeks to a month before it
 
03:43:32.510 --> 03:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
consented into the corporate system so
 
03:43:34.070 --> 03:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
that it shows up on someone's criminal
 
03:43:34.080 --> 03:43:35.150 align:start position:0%
that it shows up on someone's criminal
record

03:43:35.150 --> 03:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
record
 
03:43:37.790 --> 03:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
the system would allow someone this
 
03:43:40.910 --> 03:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
feels primarily with the time period
 
03:43:44.210 --> 03:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
from the arrest to they get to court so
 
03:43:45.889 --> 03:43:45.899 align:start position:0%
it can take sometimes months before
 
03:43:48.410 --> 03:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
someone gets in on an arraignment this
 
03:43:50.690 --> 03:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
whole time someone's out on bail there's
 
03:43:53.809 --> 03:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
no entry on their criminal record so
 
03:43:56.030 --> 03:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
they're walking around no one knows they
 
03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
are on bail except for them and perhaps
 
03:44:02.510 --> 03:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
the one Department that bailed them the
 
03:44:04.309 --> 03:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
rest of the state has no idea that this
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
person is on bail so a bail commissioner
 
03:44:08.929 --> 03:44:08.939 align:start position:0%
cannot make an informed decision as to
 
03:44:11.570 --> 03:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
whether or not to let someone go knowing
 
03:44:13.309 --> 03:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
they're already unveiling another charge
 
03:44:16.610 --> 03:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
so this is a huge Improvement I spoke to
 
03:44:19.550 --> 03:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
the state police local police the chiefs
 
03:44:21.889 --> 03:44:21.899 align:start position:0%
of Police Association this would be a
 
03:44:24.590 --> 03:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
huge office of safety issue they know
 
03:44:25.849 --> 03:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
when they when they're dealing with
 
03:44:27.710 --> 03:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
someone this person's already on bail on
 
03:44:29.150 --> 03:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
a charge
 
03:44:33.429 --> 03:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:36.410 --> 03:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
also just if I could add we have a slew
 
03:44:39.710 --> 03:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
of proposals for Bear reform because
 
03:44:42.050 --> 03:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
people are claiming you know people are
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
being let out on bail and we need to
 
03:44:44.929 --> 03:44:44.939 align:start position:0%
take this away from the bail
 
03:44:44.939 --> 03:44:46.429 align:start position:0%
take this away from the bail
commissioners

03:44:46.429 --> 03:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
03:44:48.650 --> 03:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
and a lot of those bills would be
 
03:44:50.210 --> 03:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
unnecessary because the bail
 
03:44:52.729 --> 03:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are being blamed in the
 
03:44:54.590 --> 03:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
the bail reform that was done years ago
 
03:44:56.150 --> 03:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's being blamed and it's not
 
03:44:58.910 --> 03:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily true because it's never been
 
03:45:01.190 --> 03:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
tried the because nobody really knows if
 
03:45:03.590 --> 03:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
anyone's on bail so a bail commissioner
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
and the system is being blamed even
 
03:45:10.309 --> 03:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:12.410 --> 03:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
03:45:16.070 --> 03:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:16.080 --> 03:45:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
question

03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:45:19.729 --> 03:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
um The Proposal the memo that we get
 
03:45:22.670 --> 03:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
detail is about 851
 
03:45:25.010 --> 03:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
000 in funding but asks for one million
 
03:45:27.530 --> 03:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
with chairman Roy be able to uh
 
03:45:30.590 --> 03:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
illuminate the additional about 149 000
 
03:45:32.210 --> 03:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
that is being requested that's not
 
03:45:35.950 --> 03:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:39.650 --> 03:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
I still wasn't clear on the question
 
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
the memo that we have breaks down costs
 
03:45:45.050 --> 03:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
up to 851
 
03:45:46.849 --> 03:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
000 but then they ask for a million in
 
03:45:49.130 --> 03:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
funding is there any background on the
 
03:45:51.950 --> 03:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
remaining 149 that are not documented
 
03:45:51.960 --> 03:45:52.790 align:start position:0%
remaining 149 that are not documented
here

03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:45:57.170 --> 03:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
was where was the request for the 851
 
03:45:57.180 --> 03:45:59.450 align:start position:0%
was where was the request for the 851
oh

03:45:59.450 --> 03:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:46:01.250 --> 03:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
okay that was that was another
 
03:46:02.990 --> 03:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
attachment you gave me but I don't have
 
03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
in front of me you know that's uh
 
03:46:07.849 --> 03:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
yeah I gave you the back of the back
 
03:46:07.859 --> 03:46:08.690 align:start position:0%
yeah I gave you the back of the back
quotes

03:46:08.690 --> 03:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
quotes
 
03:46:10.849 --> 03:46:10.859 align:start position:0%
yeah these these were backup quotes okay
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
so overall it said 850 000 potential
 
03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
legislative funding is a million do you
 
03:46:19.010 --> 03:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
know what the reason is the difference
 
03:46:23.030 --> 03:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:24.889 --> 03:46:24.899 align:start position:0%
they have three or four different
 
03:46:28.010 --> 03:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
vendors that handle the software for
 
03:46:29.570 --> 03:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
different police departments around the
 
03:46:29.580 --> 03:46:30.349 align:start position:0%
different police departments around the
state

03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
and for them to be able to access this
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
new system they're going to put in place
 
03:46:37.610 --> 03:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
they have to write software updates
 
03:46:40.849 --> 03:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
so some of the money is for an update
 
03:46:43.370 --> 03:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
yes some of the money is is for vendors
 
03:46:45.530 --> 03:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
to update the various police departments
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
how they sink in to the state system
 
03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
right now the the way we have it it
 
03:46:52.370 --> 03:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
frankly needs the whole thing needs
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
updating but this is the the a quick fix
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
and it's really frankly cheap money
 
03:46:59.269 --> 03:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
compared to what it would take to revamp
 
03:47:01.910 --> 03:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
the whole system
 
03:47:04.370 --> 03:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yes and I
 
03:47:06.290 --> 03:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
will State for the record that in my
 
03:47:08.150 --> 03:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
experiences the finance director of the
 
03:47:10.190 --> 03:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
town of Windham there were quite a few
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
frustrations between the police
 
03:47:13.729 --> 03:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
department and the State Police in terms
 
03:47:15.410 --> 03:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
of just the difficulty of occasionally
 
03:47:17.150 --> 03:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
communicating so
 
03:47:21.050 --> 03:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
you know I I have seen reports of those
 
03:47:23.269 --> 03:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
type of you know glitches that made it
 
03:47:25.130 --> 03:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
hard to communicate not on this
 
03:47:30.889 --> 03:47:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:30.899 --> 03:47:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
I

03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:47:35.150 --> 03:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
um just a question about if this was
 
03:47:37.190 --> 03:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
such a great program how come it didn't
 
03:47:40.550 --> 03:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
come through a normal procedure
 
03:47:42.110 --> 03:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
did you hear that how come it didn't
 
03:47:43.910 --> 03:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
come through normal procedure
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh once again because it was not known
 
03:47:49.250 --> 03:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
at the time this was something that just
 
03:47:52.130 --> 03:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
came up in the last 30 days as I
 
03:47:54.530 --> 03:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
considered these bail reform bills and
 
03:47:57.530 --> 03:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
we dug into the process and it was
 
03:47:59.450 --> 03:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
realized because remember everybody's
 
03:48:01.969 --> 03:48:01.979 align:start position:0%
operating in silos the state police have
 
03:48:04.190 --> 03:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
their system the local police have their
 
03:48:07.429 --> 03:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
systems and neither neither of them knew
 
03:48:08.929 --> 03:48:08.939 align:start position:0%
that they weren't talking to each other
 
03:48:11.090 --> 03:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
so when I asked them why are bail
 
03:48:13.610 --> 03:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
Commissioners releasing people that are
 
03:48:16.490 --> 03:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
already on bail it became apparent that
 
03:48:18.469 --> 03:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
they didn't know people or already out
 
03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
of bail
 
03:48:21.530 --> 03:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
so the state police within their own
 
03:48:24.530 --> 03:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
system know if they arrest somebody in
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
that person's on bail but they don't
 
03:48:28.309 --> 03:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
know for example if Manchester police
 
03:48:30.710 --> 03:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
arrested somebody and it goes vice versa
 
03:48:33.889 --> 03:48:33.899 align:start position:0%
so neither side of them or or nobody in
 
03:48:35.690 --> 03:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
the system realized the system wasn't
 
03:48:38.030 --> 03:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
talking to each other until I dug into
 
03:48:40.190 --> 03:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
it and made them explain why a bail
 
03:48:41.690 --> 03:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner would possibly let somebody
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
out who's already on bail
 
03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
so that's why I didn't come to the
 
03:48:49.610 --> 03:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.469 --> 03:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
03:48:53.210 --> 03:48:53.220 align:start position:0%
um yeah thanks for doing this through
 
03:48:56.450 --> 03:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
the phone uh this is Kate Murray
 
03:48:59.030 --> 03:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
um what again I I retained all the bail
 
03:49:01.370 --> 03:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
bills once I realized that this was a
 
03:49:03.710 --> 03:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
problem we had a slew of bail bills to
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
fix a system that Frank ly may not need
 
03:49:08.809 --> 03:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
fixing once I realized this was the
 
03:49:11.090 --> 03:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
problem I said we need to fix this
 
03:49:12.889 --> 03:49:12.899 align:start position:0%
before we start passing bail reform
 
03:49:14.870 --> 03:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
bills that frankly wouldn't do anything
 
03:49:17.269 --> 03:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
if this system isn't working
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
good point yeah thank you for that can
 
03:49:22.969 --> 03:49:22.979 align:start position:0%
you say what is one net environment for
 
03:49:25.309 --> 03:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
justice or J-1 I mean what we're looking
 
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
at seems to be a proposal from a company
 
03:49:29.090 --> 03:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
03:49:30.830 --> 03:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
um and I'm still very uncomfortable that
 
03:49:32.570 --> 03:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not hearing from the Department of
 
03:49:35.750 --> 03:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
Safety uh so can you speak to who wrote
 
03:49:37.490 --> 03:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
this memo
 
03:49:40.610 --> 03:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
that memo came from um I believe it's
 
03:49:43.550 --> 03:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
the head person who's in charge of the
 
03:49:46.610 --> 03:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
state police system that maintains all
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
of these things the state police
 
03:49:51.170 --> 03:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
maintains a repository system I believe
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
it's called spots and I'm not too far
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
ahead of you on knowing what all this
 
03:49:57.229 --> 03:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
means because I had to dig into it
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
myself and it's very confusing but the
 
03:50:02.150 --> 03:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
the state police as far as I understand
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
hold the repository and various vendors
 
03:50:08.210 --> 03:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
work with them so that different
 
03:50:11.150 --> 03:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
departments can access that repository
 
03:50:14.929 --> 03:50:14.939 align:start position:0%
so I asked the state police this person
 
03:50:17.630 --> 03:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
who wrote the memo to get me
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
the companies that would be involved in
 
03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
what it would cost so that everyone
 
03:50:23.150 --> 03:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
could access that system and that's why
 
03:50:24.410 --> 03:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
you see these different companies
 
03:50:24.420 --> 03:50:26.809 align:start position:0%
you see these different companies
involved

03:50:26.809 --> 03:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
involved
 
03:50:29.210 --> 03:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
yeah is does that pertain also because I
 
03:50:30.229 --> 03:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
see there's something the computer
 
03:50:32.929 --> 03:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
projects of Illinois quotation uh the
 
03:50:35.050 --> 03:50:35.060 align:start position:0%
bail condition notification hot file
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
sent to Jennifer Hackett and this is you
 
03:50:39.889 --> 03:50:39.899 align:start position:0%
know um
 
03:50:43.190 --> 03:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
is 181 thousand why what is this telling
 
03:50:43.200 --> 03:50:44.090 align:start position:0%
is 181 thousand why what is this telling
me

03:50:44.090 --> 03:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
this this page who are they
 
03:50:49.250 --> 03:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
she's looking at the spreadsheet and
 
03:50:51.050 --> 03:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
asking why all those other people are
 
03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
involved other than just computer CPI
 
03:50:56.090 --> 03:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
computer projects of Illinois plus
 
03:50:58.370 --> 03:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
computer square and so on there's
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
several there's three different figures
 
03:51:02.750 --> 03:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
on here and then no there's more there's
 
03:51:02.760 --> 03:51:04.190 align:start position:0%
on here and then no there's more there's
six

03:51:04.190 --> 03:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
six
 
03:51:05.870 --> 03:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
um each one each one of those different
 
03:51:08.690 --> 03:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
line items is a vendor who is
 
03:51:11.090 --> 03:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
03:51:14.150 --> 03:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
um accessing or writing software that
 
03:51:16.969 --> 03:51:16.979 align:start position:0%
allow other other departments to access
 
03:51:20.090 --> 03:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
the the state police system
 
03:51:21.950 --> 03:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
and if it would help I could probably
 
03:51:23.630 --> 03:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
try and reach out to the person who
 
03:51:25.849 --> 03:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
wrote that memo and see if I could get
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
her to get on a call with you would that
 
03:51:29.870 --> 03:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
be helpful if I could see if I could
 
03:51:31.790 --> 03:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
access her right now it would be helpful
 
03:51:35.269 --> 03:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
to hear from the Department of Safety
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
again why don't you let me
 
03:51:39.050 --> 03:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
let me reach out to her
 
03:51:41.150 --> 03:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
she with all due respect we have a ton
 
03:51:43.309 --> 03:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
of work today and I mean really visited
 
03:51:45.469 --> 03:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
even a division two issue
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
yeah it is we have safety that's true
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:55.250 --> 03:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
right thank you do we have enough
 
03:51:57.410 --> 03:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
information to vote
 
03:52:03.950 --> 03:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:03.960 --> 03:52:05.450 align:start position:0%
 
office

03:52:05.450 --> 03:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:52:10.729 --> 03:52:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
effort as well
 
03:52:15.950 --> 03:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:20.929 --> 03:52:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:22.670 --> 03:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
I think Mr chairman I I move the
 
03:52:22.680 --> 03:52:36.710 align:start position:0%
I think Mr chairman I I move the
question

03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:36.720 --> 03:52:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:42.469 --> 03:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
so I'll work with the Department of
 
03:52:44.809 --> 03:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
Safety to clarify what this is for and
 
03:52:46.429 --> 03:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
come up with something in House Bill too
 
03:52:48.410 --> 03:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
to direct the funds for what its
 
03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
so just to close out House Bill 2 if we
 
03:52:59.650 --> 03:52:59.660 align:start position:0%
want to flip to
 
03:53:04.010 --> 03:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
page two of the packet
 
03:53:06.170 --> 03:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
I'll go through our blanks here and just
 
03:53:07.429 --> 03:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
kind of update everyone as to where
 
03:53:08.510 --> 03:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
we're at
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
so section 159 the suspension of RSA 99b
 
03:53:15.010 --> 03:53:15.020 align:start position:0%
I think we can delete that section the
 
03:53:17.210 --> 03:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
decisions made to this point you'll be
 
03:53:19.370 --> 03:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
in compliance with that law so you won't
 
03:53:23.710 --> 03:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh 164 section 164 and 167 this was
 
03:53:29.929 --> 03:53:29.939 align:start position:0%
addressed earlier today with amendment
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
number 1105 representative Weiler's
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh 165 167 there's a placeholder there
 
03:53:41.929 --> 03:53:41.939 align:start position:0%
those sections relative to the school
 
03:53:44.150 --> 03:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
building Aid fund the 75 million that
 
03:53:45.469 --> 03:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
was proposed the governors will just be
 
03:53:46.849 --> 03:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
deleted so there'll be an amendment to
 
03:53:49.269 --> 03:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
delete those
 
03:53:53.210 --> 03:53:53.220 align:start position:0%
the section 170 the CTE renovation that
 
03:53:55.849 --> 03:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
will be part of the 1105 amendment that
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
switches that over to the general fund
 
03:54:01.870 --> 03:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
section 171
 
03:54:04.870 --> 03:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
172 173
 
03:54:08.330 --> 03:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
174 and 175.
 
03:54:10.370 --> 03:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
will be part of
 
03:54:12.010 --> 03:54:12.020 align:start position:0%
and also
 
03:54:15.650 --> 03:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
177 will be part of a an adequacy
 
03:54:17.090 --> 03:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
amendment that'll essentially be that
 
03:54:19.190 --> 03:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
proposal 10 that we adopted earlier
 
03:54:19.200 --> 03:54:22.550 align:start position:0%
proposal 10 that we adopted earlier
today

03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:24.769 --> 03:54:24.779 align:start position:0%
which will also include
 
03:54:28.790 --> 03:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
going back a ways now a repeal of the
 
03:54:30.769 --> 03:54:30.779 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs accountability plans
 
03:54:32.929 --> 03:54:32.939 align:start position:0%
if you remember we talked about that so
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
that didn't come up today but I'm
 
03:54:36.590 --> 03:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
tracking that as a tentative thing the
 
03:54:38.809 --> 03:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
division was unanimously supportive so
 
03:54:41.630 --> 03:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
that Amendment will include that
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
section 176 relative to Charter Schools
 
03:54:47.210 --> 03:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
we adopted the amendment to bring their
 
03:54:47.220 --> 03:54:48.170 align:start position:0%
we adopted the amendment to bring their
total

03:54:48.170 --> 03:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
total
 
03:54:50.450 --> 03:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
base aid plus additional Grant up to
 
03:54:51.769 --> 03:54:51.779 align:start position:0%
nine thousand the representative Mooney
 
03:54:56.689 --> 03:54:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:56.699 --> 03:54:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
Steve

03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
Steve
 
03:54:59.570 --> 03:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
from velax
 
03:55:02.689 --> 03:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
um in that he is a charter school but
 
03:55:06.050 --> 03:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
kind of exists in a alternate framework
 
03:55:09.170 --> 03:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
um will he benefit from this because I I
 
03:55:10.910 --> 03:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
told him I thought he would because the
 
03:55:13.790 --> 03:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
base 4.7 went up
 
03:55:13.800 --> 03:55:15.170 align:start position:0%
base 4.7 went up
so

03:55:15.170 --> 03:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:18.650 --> 03:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
um he his payments are based on a
 
03:55:21.889 --> 03:55:21.899 align:start position:0%
percentage of they divided by Caitlyn
 
03:55:24.769 --> 03:55:24.779 align:start position:0%
knows by the number of courses
 
03:55:26.809 --> 03:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
um but he would benefit he just doesn't
 
03:55:28.849 --> 03:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
get the thousand dollars from
 
03:55:31.150 --> 03:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney's Bill
 
03:55:33.650 --> 03:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
the debate the representative Mooney's
 
03:55:35.570 --> 03:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
build is not address velax right the
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
amount to base the cost of adequate
 
03:55:38.750 --> 03:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
education is considered for vlax and
 
03:55:40.689 --> 03:55:40.699 align:start position:0%
deal week and correct me if I'm wrong
 
03:55:44.090 --> 03:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:55:47.929 --> 03:55:47.939 align:start position:0%
and sections 210 to 11 relative to the
 
03:55:49.729 --> 03:55:49.739 align:start position:0%
business profits and business Enterprise
 
03:55:51.769 --> 03:55:51.779 align:start position:0%
tax allocations that was covered with
 
03:55:53.570 --> 03:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler's bill as well or
 
03:55:56.030 --> 03:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me Amendment 1105. so
 
03:56:00.110 --> 03:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
my plan is to
 
03:56:03.469 --> 03:56:03.479 align:start position:0%
update this as our final cumulative of
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
everything we've done to this point as
 
03:56:08.450 --> 03:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
well as the next few pages the I'll
 
03:56:10.969 --> 03:56:10.979 align:start position:0%
shade the things we approved today on
 
03:56:13.910 --> 03:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
the additional requests I will update
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
page five which is the culmination of
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
all the budgetary changes the month the
 
03:56:21.290 --> 03:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
money impacts that the division did as
 
03:56:23.330 --> 03:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
well as your general or excuse me not
 
03:56:25.130 --> 03:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
general education trust fund Highway
 
03:56:26.929 --> 03:56:26.939 align:start position:0%
fund and Fish and Game Surplus
 
03:56:26.939 --> 03:56:32.210 align:start position:0%
fund and Fish and Game Surplus
statements

03:56:32.210 --> 03:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
two unrepresentative heck and Phillips
 
03:56:38.809 --> 03:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
um request we had started conversation
 
03:56:43.070 --> 03:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
about the efas and reducing the total
 
03:56:46.130 --> 03:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
amount per um
 
03:56:48.590 --> 03:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
per year of the biennium and then
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
changing removing those funds and adding
 
03:56:54.889 --> 03:56:54.899 align:start position:0%
them to the building Aid is that
 
03:56:57.290 --> 03:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
something that we could contemplate for
 
03:57:01.250 --> 03:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
for this budget period please
 
03:57:03.229 --> 03:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
for action and I don't know if
 
03:57:05.330 --> 03:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips wants to
 
03:57:08.510 --> 03:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
say anything else to go with that
 
03:57:11.929 --> 03:57:11.939 align:start position:0%
I think for as we talked about earlier I
 
03:57:14.269 --> 03:57:14.279 align:start position:0%
think in terms of our selling
 
03:57:16.910 --> 03:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
this budget to the caucus I think the
 
03:57:18.769 --> 03:57:18.779 align:start position:0%
fact that we're increasing building Aid
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
by twenty thousand twenty million
 
03:57:23.929 --> 03:57:23.939 align:start position:0%
dollars and reducing the efas by 20
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars would be significant it
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
would be taking it from 60 to 40 and I
 
03:57:33.590 --> 03:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
we don't know we don't have a fiscal
 
03:57:35.210 --> 03:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
note from the Department of Ed because
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
they've said that it's indeterminate
 
03:57:39.050 --> 03:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
because they don't know who's going to
 
03:57:43.790 --> 03:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
apply and um what category they'd be in
 
03:57:47.389 --> 03:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
um so it looks like 40 million dollars
 
03:57:49.490 --> 03:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
would be enough
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
um Caitlyn would you correct me if I'm
 
03:57:51.359 --> 03:58:02.630 align:start position:0%
um Caitlyn would you correct me if I'm
wrong

03:58:02.630 --> 03:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
um you are corrected in the fact that
 
03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
the department does not have any family
 
03:58:08.510 --> 03:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
media and information so we can't do it
 
03:58:10.370 --> 03:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
an estimate to determine how many
 
03:58:13.309 --> 03:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
additional kids may become eligible
 
03:58:16.490 --> 03:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair if in fact for some reason
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
the efas went over I believe that money
 
03:58:23.330 --> 03:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
would be just drawn down from the trust
 
03:58:25.010 --> 03:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
that is correct the department has the
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
ability to draw a warrant for any
 
03:58:28.929 --> 03:58:28.939 align:start position:0%
additional funds needed for both or for
 
03:58:31.610 --> 03:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
traditional adequacy district adequacy
 
03:58:34.370 --> 03:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
and efas
 
03:58:43.030 --> 03:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:46.969 --> 03:58:46.979 align:start position:0%
so I I believe let me explain how that
 
03:58:49.309 --> 03:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
works so two things happening here one
 
03:58:50.269 --> 03:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
for just everyone's General
 
03:58:52.130 --> 03:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
understanding efas are similar to
 
03:58:54.170 --> 03:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
Charters and adequacy in that it doesn't
 
03:58:55.490 --> 03:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
matter how much money is in the
 
03:58:56.870 --> 03:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund those warrants are
 
03:58:58.969 --> 03:58:58.979 align:start position:0%
drawn and those payments are paid
 
03:59:01.309 --> 03:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
but as far as the EFA
 
03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.550 --> 03:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
really a symbol of your estimate of what
 
03:59:09.170 --> 03:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
you think the program would cost so
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
while the department does have the
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
authority to you could put zero in the
 
03:59:15.349 --> 03:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
budget and not not account for it and
 
03:59:16.729 --> 03:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
you just wouldn't be capturing what you
 
03:59:16.739 --> 03:59:17.570 align:start position:0%
you just wouldn't be capturing what you
think

03:59:17.570 --> 03:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:59:19.250 --> 03:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
is going to be the actual cost of that
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
program and doe would still cut those
 
03:59:23.210 --> 03:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
checks so really what you see in house
 
03:59:26.330 --> 03:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
bill one for adequacy charter schools
 
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
and DFAS is really your budget
 
03:59:29.450 --> 03:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
committee's estimate of what you think
 
03:59:31.670 --> 03:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
those costs will be so if you are going
 
03:59:33.769 --> 03:59:33.779 align:start position:0%
to set a new number for those you should
 
03:59:36.650 --> 03:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
have a basis for why you're doing that
 
03:59:36.660 --> 03:59:38.030 align:start position:0%
have a basis for why you're doing that
and

03:59:38.030 --> 03:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:39.830 --> 03:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have any guidance on that at
 
03:59:42.170 --> 03:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
this point if you recall last biennium
 
03:59:43.969 --> 03:59:43.979 align:start position:0%
there was also a budget committee
 
03:59:45.889 --> 03:59:45.899 align:start position:0%
estimate and there's also other
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
estimates in the Surplus statement
 
03:59:49.070 --> 03:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
relative to other programs that it's up
 
03:59:51.290 --> 03:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
to the budget writers to say this is
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
what we think it's going to be and as of
 
03:59:55.729 --> 03:59:55.739 align:start position:0%
right now there's been no change to the
 
03:59:57.710 --> 03:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
29 million per year that has been put
 
03:59:59.630 --> 03:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
forward by the department and then the
 
04:00:02.330 --> 04:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
governor for the EFA program for 25 and
 
04:00:06.170 --> 04:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
26. 24 and 25. so any change to that I
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
would just say uh
 
04:00:12.650 --> 04:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:15.469 --> 04:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
since the funding has to happen
 
04:00:17.809 --> 04:00:17.819 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we budget I don't
 
04:00:19.790 --> 04:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
think that cutting anything from the
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
funding accomplishes anything really
 
04:00:24.170 --> 04:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
because the same amount will be spent
 
04:00:26.809 --> 04:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
regardless of what amount we put in the
 
04:00:29.330 --> 04:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
budget so to come back to the amount we
 
04:00:31.309 --> 04:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
put on the budget it is the best
 
04:00:33.410 --> 04:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
forecast we have right now in terms of
 
04:00:34.849 --> 04:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
what we expect we expect the
 
04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures to be and yeah those
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
forecasts have not been terribly
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
accurate in the past but you still have
 
04:00:42.650 --> 04:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
to make a good faith effort to put the
 
04:00:45.050 --> 04:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
you know correct number there so I would
 
04:00:48.650 --> 04:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
suggest maybe decoupling the question of
 
04:00:50.570 --> 04:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
what we put in the building aid from
 
04:00:52.189 --> 04:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
what we take out of the Year phase
 
04:00:53.570 --> 04:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
because I just
 
04:00:56.150 --> 04:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
don't really see how
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
changing that EFA number does anything
 
04:01:03.349 --> 04:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
then put us at risk of not saving money
 
04:01:06.170 --> 04:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
for expenditures we may need and then we
 
04:01:08.090 --> 04:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
will run into trouble with potentially
 
04:01:14.689 --> 04:01:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:17.630 --> 04:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
um I've asked what was the basis for
 
04:01:19.849 --> 04:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
coming up with the 30 million or guess
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
what is it yeah 30 million each year
 
04:01:23.450 --> 04:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
what was it
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
um you know I propose what Mickey was
 
04:01:27.050 --> 04:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
saying that these things are based on
 
04:01:29.030 --> 04:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
some sort of a measure
 
04:01:31.309 --> 04:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
what was the EXP what was that measure
 
04:01:33.769 --> 04:01:33.779 align:start position:0%
we didn't get an answer from the
 
04:01:33.779 --> 04:01:34.790 align:start position:0%
we didn't get an answer from the
commissioner

04:01:34.790 --> 04:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:01:36.370 --> 04:01:36.380 align:start position:0%
um there seems to be you know whatever
 
04:01:39.950 --> 04:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
principles involved we don't know so as
 
04:01:43.130 --> 04:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
far as I can tell this this estimate is
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
just a guess and it's not based on
 
04:01:45.000 --> 04:01:47.410 align:start position:0%
just a guess and it's not based on
anything

04:01:47.410 --> 04:01:47.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:49.670 --> 04:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
true but it came from apartment event
 
04:01:51.170 --> 04:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
went through the governor and then it
 
04:01:52.910 --> 04:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
came to us so
 
04:01:55.309 --> 04:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
my eyeballs have been looking at it well
 
04:01:56.990 --> 04:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
then our estimate would be as valid as
 
04:01:59.330 --> 04:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
theirs since it's both based on an
 
04:02:01.189 --> 04:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
estimate of what we might imagine so
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
ours would be as valuable any estimate
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:16.670 --> 04:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:16.680 --> 04:02:18.290 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:02:18.290 --> 04:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:18.300 --> 04:02:20.389 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:23.389 --> 04:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
I should probably look at the right page
 
04:02:23.399 --> 04:02:26.630 align:start position:0%
I should probably look at the right page
um

04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:32.150 --> 04:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.150 --> 04:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at page seven line item
 
04:02:42.239 --> 04:02:45.889 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at page seven line item
28

04:02:45.889 --> 04:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:52.189 --> 04:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.030 --> 04:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 and 25 estimate for the
 
04:03:00.410 --> 04:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts by 50 so that
 
04:03:03.290 --> 04:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
it would Now read oh I'm sorry
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
um by 10 000 each a million sorry yes
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
that's been a long day
 
04:03:12.170 --> 04:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
10 million each so that uh the line item
 
04:03:15.050 --> 04:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
for 24 would Now read
 
04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
19 million 852 000 uh and for 25 as well
 
04:03:20.399 --> 04:03:21.290 align:start position:0%
19 million 852 000 uh and for 25 as well
um

04:03:21.290 --> 04:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:23.870 --> 04:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
and my proposal
 
04:03:28.250 --> 04:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
is to net out that change and to
 
04:03:30.170 --> 04:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
allocate that additional 10 million in
 
04:03:31.729 --> 04:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
each year
 
04:03:34.969 --> 04:03:34.979 align:start position:0%
for school building a new projects which
 
04:03:41.570 --> 04:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:41.580 --> 04:03:43.130 align:start position:0%
 
second

04:03:43.130 --> 04:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:03:45.889 --> 04:03:45.899 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
04:03:50.750 --> 04:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:59.269 --> 04:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:02.450 --> 04:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
so we want to make that motion
 
04:04:04.610 --> 04:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
04:04:07.130 --> 04:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
make a motion to authorize the LBA to
 
04:04:09.170 --> 04:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
make any Technical and mechanical
 
04:04:12.290 --> 04:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
changes necessary to HB one and two in
 
04:04:13.849 --> 04:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
order to reflect the intent of the
 
04:04:13.859 --> 04:04:17.090 align:start position:0%
order to reflect the intent of the
division

04:04:17.090 --> 04:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.670 --> 04:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.680 --> 04:04:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
nothing

04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:36.590 --> 04:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
so Fish and Game Surplus statement on
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
page nine will be how you see it there
 
04:04:40.610 --> 04:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
there's no changes made to that
 
04:04:43.849 --> 04:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
so at this point committee I will we did
 
04:04:44.929 --> 04:04:44.939 align:start position:0%
a lot of stuff today so I'm going to
 
04:04:47.090 --> 04:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
take all this back and update these
 
04:04:50.150 --> 04:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
tracking sheets with all the Amendments
 
04:04:52.130 --> 04:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
we've adopted with updates and the
 
04:04:54.410 --> 04:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
columns as the decisions made the
 
04:04:58.130 --> 04:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
dollars spent as well as the updated
 
04:05:00.170 --> 04:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
Surplus statements for Education fish
 
04:05:03.050 --> 04:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
and Highway I'm going to send those out
 
04:05:06.050 --> 04:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
as soon as I can to this Division and
 
04:05:08.090 --> 04:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
I'll put it online so everyone knows
 
04:05:10.250 --> 04:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
what I've tracked as our changes please
 
04:05:12.170 --> 04:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
review that if you see an egregious
 
04:05:14.210 --> 04:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
error you know that you think wait a
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
minute I don't think we did that I'll
 
04:05:17.630 --> 04:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
double check with the clerks file and
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
we'll see if we captured everything as
 
04:05:22.849 --> 04:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
intended by the committee I would
 
04:05:27.849 --> 04:05:27.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:30.530 --> 04:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
only if necessary I'm gonna I'll have
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
Janet's schedule uh and post a meeting
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
for 10 o'clock on Friday uh sometime
 
04:05:38.090 --> 04:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
between now and then you'll know the
 
04:05:39.769 --> 04:05:39.779 align:start position:0%
division chairs will know if there's a
 
04:05:42.290 --> 04:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
need to to gather again or Not by then
 
04:05:44.450 --> 04:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
so I would keep it open on your
 
04:05:46.429 --> 04:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
schedules but you know if it's
 
04:05:48.410 --> 04:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
determined that it's not necessary then
 
04:05:49.809 --> 04:05:49.819 align:start position:0%
we're good to go until next week
 
04:05:53.689 --> 04:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'll get back Friday and take
 
04:05:55.130 --> 04:05:55.140 align:start position:0%
up whatever things we need to take up
 
04:05:55.140 --> 04:05:56.689 align:start position:0%
up whatever things we need to take up
then

04:05:56.689 --> 04:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:05:59.150 --> 04:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
it's the quick logistical question when
 
04:06:01.370 --> 04:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
do we expect to have an idea of whether
 
04:06:03.050 --> 04:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
the 10m will be needed or not I mean I'm
 
04:06:04.969 --> 04:06:04.979 align:start position:0%
keeping my schedule open but I'd like to
 
04:06:07.790 --> 04:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
not have to keep it open until 9am on
 
04:06:09.650 --> 04:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
Friday to hear about it I mean when
 
04:06:12.410 --> 04:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
would be a reasonable time to expect to
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
know either way
 
04:06:17.450 --> 04:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
so we based after everyone after the
 
04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
three divisions wrap up today we'll pull
 
04:06:20.990 --> 04:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
it all together we'll tabulate
 
04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
everything and we'll provide to the
 
04:06:24.769 --> 04:06:24.779 align:start position:0%
chair and the division chairs the
 
04:06:26.990 --> 04:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
position that we see that all the
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
decisions are in then it'll be up to the
 
04:06:32.570 --> 04:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
chairman to decide from there if it's
 
04:06:35.090 --> 04:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
necessary or not we'll probably sometime
 
04:06:37.070 --> 04:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or Thursday perhaps tomorrow
 
04:06:38.929 --> 04:06:38.939 align:start position:0%
perhaps Thursday
 
04:06:41.150 --> 04:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
I mean honestly feeds by Thursday it's
 
04:06:43.429 --> 04:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
fine I just you know there is a certain
 
04:06:45.469 --> 04:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
amount of uncertainty at the last moment
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
that's hard to do you know I'm not
 
04:06:52.729 --> 04:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
worried about Thursday I already know
 
04:06:55.370 --> 04:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments
 
04:06:58.250 --> 04:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
okay so we will recess until Friday at
 
04:06:58.260 --> 04:06:59.570 align:start position:0%
okay so we will recess until Friday at
10.

04:06:59.570 --> 04:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
10.
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
or sooner potentially I mean I don't
 
04:07:02.510 --> 04:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
think you're going to want to meet after
 
04:07:04.250 --> 04:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
a session day but I would just say
 
04:07:06.650 --> 04:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
you're in recess in recess there you go
 
04:07:08.450 --> 04:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
perfect not into a specific time that's
 
04:07:10.729 --> 04:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
all oh I got you I got you thank you
 
04:07:13.849 --> 04:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:13.859 --> 04:07:16.580 align:start position:0%
