00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:43.840 --> 00:01:07.190 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay being the appointed hour i i'm
 
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
going to start
 
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.390 align:start position:0%
going to start
we

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
did kind of all call here on our
 
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
remaining bills because of time
 
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
so i apologize if we might
 
00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh keep some people here
 
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
inadvertently but
 
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
last time i scheduled bills with
 
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.550 align:start position:0%
last time i scheduled bills with
intervals

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
intervals
 
00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
we wasted the whole day and
 
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
this way at least we're going to get it
 
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.590 align:start position:0%
this way at least we're going to get it
done

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
because the the foot's on the neck to
 
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
get things done just so you'll know
 
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
i want to start we had a request to
 
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
start with
 
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.789 align:start position:0%
start with
hb

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 align:start position:0%
hb
 
00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.350 align:start position:0%
hb
1587

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
1587
 
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
so i'll open the work session on house
 
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
bill 1587.
 
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 align:start position:0%
i know the sponsor is here and if you'd
 
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
like to say make a couple of comments
 
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
here so here's my plan on this bill
 
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
we do have an amendment
 
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.389 align:start position:0%
we do have an amendment
uh

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
which basically changes the amount from
 
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
56 million to 28 million
 
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
i i plan to have that amendment
 
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
voted on today and then recess this work
 
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
session until friday at 1.
 
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
because right now the
 
00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
leadership's trying to amass how much
 
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
money are coming through from the
 
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
different finance departments
 
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
so we we don't know i'm meeting at four
 
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
o'clock this afternoon with a speaker on
 
00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
these topics so
 
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
by friday at one o'clock we should have
 
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
a resolve
 
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
and uh we may have another amendment i'm
 
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
but we're we're in the state of studied
 
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
flux right now
 
00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 align:start position:0%
so does anybody have any comments on
 
00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
1587 they'd like to make one way or the
 
00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.150 align:start position:0%
1587 they'd like to make one way or the
other

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
please

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm representative steve pearson
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
rockingham district six
 
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
which encompasses
 
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.070 align:start position:0%
which encompasses
dairy

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
not having that amendment in front of me
 
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
i would really like to see what that
 
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
all it does is change the amount
 
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
right now the amount is is a 55 million
 
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.710 align:start position:0%
right now the amount is is a 55 million
900

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
900
 
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
and all it does is take it to 28 million
 
00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing the amendment does
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
is that correct mike
 
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 align:start position:0%
do you have it available i do we want
 
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
why don't you pass it out because the
 
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors ask the question so we can
 
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
answer that question so um
 
00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
for a mona for just the sake of
 
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
technicality i'm the dr i'm actually the
 
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.229 align:start position:0%
technicality i'm the dr i'm actually the
drafter

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
drafter
 
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
of this and representative pratt filed
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
it oh okay but i wrote it so and you
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
know how that goes right i mean
 
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.910 align:start position:0%
know how that goes right i mean
but

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
one just one of the things i wanted to
 
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
touch upon
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm certainly by no means here to
 
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
steal anyone's thunder
 
00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 align:start position:0%
is the situation
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
that that we're facing right now has
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know surprisingly
 
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately it has gotten
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
substantially worse
 
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
not better okay
 
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned in my floor speech
 
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
when we when this was passed as a
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
policy piece
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
then at the time the national guard was
 
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
being used to augment the prison
 
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.070 align:start position:0%
being used to augment the prison
staffing

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
crisis they have been removed from the
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
prison system
 
00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
so now the the department of corrections
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
can't even rely on the backfilling of
 
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
national guard troops
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
and and i
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not entirely sure how disastrous
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
this is going to be for them i know that
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
these troops barely got them to tread
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
water so
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
having been in the emergency services in
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for 20 years is
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
there are situations that are occurring
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
today that if someone told me 20 years
 
00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 align:start position:0%
ago i would have told them they were out
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
of their minds
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
as a as a real world example i tested
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
for manchester fire in 2001
 
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
with 400 people
 
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.870 align:start position:0%
with 400 people
today

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
we have as matter they don't not only do
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
they have no one to pick from they've
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
offered the job a job to five people and
 
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
five people have said no
 
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
that hasn't happened in the 165 year
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
history of the manchester fire
 
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.230 align:start position:0%
history of the manchester fire
department

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
manchester police is now doing
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
recruiting as far west as ohio
 
00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 align:start position:0%
and that again that's something that was
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
never even fathomed
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
10 years ago
 
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
so we really truly do have a recruitment
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
and retention problem in new hampshire
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
and you know one of the things that
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
i found acceptable you know back in the
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
day was that you know what no one ever
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
gets rich being a civil servant right
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
but on the flip side of that there's
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
there's something at the other end
 
00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:19.270 align:start position:0%
there's something at the other end
and

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
the changes that occurred back in in
 
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.670 align:start position:0%
the changes that occurred back in in
2011

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
2011
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
um that were done with no public hearing
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
they were slipped into a trailer bill
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
there was some warning actually one of
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
the fellas that did some of the warning
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
was in this room who warned them back
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
then and said look there's going to be
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
some consequences to this
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
and he was laughed at and here we are
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
now so
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
um you know i won't get into any other
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
policy part of it you guys are all on
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house i mean a veto
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
proof majority is a is a glowing example
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
of of the recognition of the situation
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
we're in right now so
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the the
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
this group you know holding a work
 
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
session and looking this over and really
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
taking the deep dive that's necessary to
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
to make this work
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
but i just really can't emphasize enough
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
the situation that we're in in new
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire is is getting worse not better
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
so i thank you folks for your time
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
and i would i would comment that
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
terms that kind of
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
i learned by going through this is
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
terminally funded
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
which means it is going to fund this for
 
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.270 align:start position:0%
which means it is going to fund this for
the

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
terminal periods of all employees
 
00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:26.070 align:start position:0%
terminal periods of all employees
involved

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
that means going to solve the problem
 
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.350 align:start position:0%
that means going to solve the problem
forever

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
forever
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
my my uh attitude right now based on
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
available funds is let's put a band-aid
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
on it and
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
kick it down the road a bit because i
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
don't know that we can afford 56 million
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
dollars right now
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
good morning representative mr chairman
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
a retired captain from the manchester
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
fire department and a past member of the
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retirement system board of
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
trustees and i'm here today to speak in
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
favor of house bill 1587.
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
first and foremost i would like to thank
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsors for introducing this bill
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
in 2011 the legislature made some
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
additional changes to the definition of
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation they used the term
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
vested status instead of when a member
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
commences service on the date of the
 
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.469 align:start position:0%
commences service on the date of the
changes

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
what they did what they did was create a
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
six-tier system the members who were
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
vested members in various stages of
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
vesting and the members who had
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
commenced service
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
prior to these changes the legislature
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
had made changes prospectively and not
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
retroactively i believe this was the
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
first time that a benefit reduction was
 
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.150 align:start position:0%
first time that a benefit reduction was
retroactive

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
retroactive
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
although the courts have ruled it is
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
legal to make these changes morally and
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
ethically is it right when an employer
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
starts his or her employment they are
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
there are there is an expectation that
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
the benefits offered when hired will be
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
there when they retire
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
when the legislature made these changes
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
i truly believe that most of them didn't
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
know or understand the long-term effects
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the changes and if they had would
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
have considered implementing them for
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
future hires only
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
when the state downshifted the
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
obligation to the cities and towns to
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
pay the 35 percent of the retirement
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
cost and the retroactive changes to the
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
benef pension benefits the employee was
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
affected both at the bargaining table
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
and in their pensions
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
these changes made it extremely
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
difficult for local communities to offer
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
a competitive
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
company compensation package to attract
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
new employees and retain existing
 
00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.190 align:start position:0%
new employees and retain existing
employees

00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
past legislative changes have proven to
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to the long-term viability
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire retirement system
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
but at what cost to the employee
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
the committee had
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
this committee heard testimony last week
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1417 where the speaker
 
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.150 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1417 where the speaker
explained

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
explained
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
they did
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
what they did it was to balance what
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
they did was to balance the budget the
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
speaker testified that the finance
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee reduced benefits and increased
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
employee contribution rates in the
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
attempt to balance the budget these
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
changes to the plan benef benefits allow
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
the local employer rates to go down
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
is this just a shift in benefit
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
obligation from the employer to the
 
00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
obligation from the employer to the
employee

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
under section 18 b average final
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
compensation shall mean for the purposes
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
of inclusion
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
in this calculation the average
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of compensation paid in
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
excess of the full base rate of
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
compensation in the highest five years
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
shall not exceed the average percentage
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
of compensation paid in the in excess of
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
the full base rate of compensation over
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
all the members years of service on or
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
after june 1st 2012 but excluding the
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
highest 12 years five years
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
you can see you you you can't have an
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
average over a member's years of service
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
without including the members highest
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
five years of service in the calculation
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
using the term over the members years of
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
all the members years of service is just
 
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.110 align:start position:0%
all the members years of service is just
that

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
excluding any part of the member service
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
in the calculations would no longer be
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
the members years
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
all the members years of service
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
this is taxation with our representation
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
we ask that
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
you support the language submitted in
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 1587 by doing so will truly
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
allow all the members years of service
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
to be calculated
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
again we asked that the committee
 
00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:49.829 align:start position:0%
again we asked that the committee
support

00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
the passage of house bill 1587 and
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
reinstate the benefits expected by the
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
employees when they were hired
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
i handed out
 
00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.910 align:start position:0%
i handed out
a

00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and on that basically shows
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
the difference from
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
prior to 2011 the first column is
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
prior to 2011 and i try to make make it
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
as simple simple as we could um where
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
you could see how somebody could spike
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
their pension if they worked a lot of
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
overtime in their last five years um
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
those five years were
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
the only years that were included in the
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
calculations for their pensions so you
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
can see somebody that uh firefighter a
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
worked no overtime at all firefighter b
 
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.030 align:start position:0%
worked no overtime at all firefighter b
worked

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
worked
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
overtime in their last five years this
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
is prior to 2011
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
so one pension would be 20 000 the other
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
pension would be 25 000 because they
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
included all the years of service
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
when you look at
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
the line that says after
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
july 1 2021 both employee and employers
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
paid into the retirement system for
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
firefighter b
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
uh uh then firefighter a
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
more into for firefighter a than
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
firefighter b but both firefighters
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
received the same pension um because
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
they eliminated the highest five years i
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
put it the last five but those five
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
highest years could be anywhere in this
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
calculation and it would the results
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
would be the same so even though the
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
employer and the employee paid into the
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
system um on the additional dollars for
 
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.389 align:start position:0%
system um on the additional dollars for
uh

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
for firefighter b the results um was the
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
same for the as firefighter eight who
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
didn't pay any additional making any
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
additional contributions
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
and then if you look at the proposed
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
changes um
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
that uh firefighter b would receive
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
roughly 20 of his average annual
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
earnings over the uh members years of
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
service so if you calculate it all
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
included the five years it's it's still
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
not like it was prior to july 1 20
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh 2011 but at least they're getting
 
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
some compensation for the years of
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
service um uh and i mean the amount of
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
money they put in for those years of
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
service and their pension would go to 21
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
000 a year so it eliminates the real
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
spiking it's but it still doesn't give
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
that individual the benefit back
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
prior to 2011 if i'm making myself clear
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i will answer any questions
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned earlier some of the
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention issues that
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're having
 
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.069 align:start position:0%
we're having
and

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
as part of that i'd like to share with
 
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.389 align:start position:0%
as part of that i'd like to share with
you

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
some numbers um representative pearson
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
had mentioned uh what was going on in
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
manchester i can tell you that that's a
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
statewide issue
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh and that began um there's a clear
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
delineation from the the changes in 2011
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
just prior to that in 2010
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
there were approximately 550 candidates
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
annually that were taking the
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
state entrance exam to become a
 
00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.910 align:start position:0%
state entrance exam to become a
firefighter

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
firefighter
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
clearly started trending downward uh
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
once the changes were made in 2011
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
and now we're seeing
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere around one 150 to 200
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
in addition to that what what
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
municipalities are seeing statewide is
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
an increase in call volume uh
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
take portsmouth for instance
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
they continue to build up um the the
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
call volume increases they're bringing
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
more people into the city uh and and the
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
calls are becoming um
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
more drastic right we're just we're
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with a global pandemic obviously
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
um the opioid crisis is is another big
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
example of of the ever-changing dynamics
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
of the job
 
00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:40.310 align:start position:0%
of the job
unfortunately

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
when they're trying to to staff these
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
positions they're creating new positions
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
because the the staffing needs to meet
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
uh what's going on in the municipality
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
as far as call volume
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they're
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
unable to fill these positions because
 
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:54.949 align:start position:0%
unable to fill these positions because
of

00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:56.470 align:start position:0%
of
um

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of things like the retirement
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
system that have changed
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
that has changed the members benefit
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
over over time so we're seeing um for
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
every person that we're hiring in
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire we're
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
seeing two vacancies which is a
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
significant problem in fact last april
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
the the state hit an all-time low with
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
the number of candidates that took the
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
the test uh in in that quarter was 39
 
00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:24.870 align:start position:0%
the test uh in in that quarter was 39
candidates

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
for hundreds of open positions
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a significant problem and i
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
think it because you can draw the
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
correlation to what happened to the
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
retirement system in 2011 it's one that
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
we realize that that's where the fix
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
needs to start
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
the department of safety has recognized
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
this to be an issue they're working to
 
00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:48.070 align:start position:0%
this to be an issue they're working to
develop

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
develop
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
coordinator recruitment and retention
 
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.950 align:start position:0%
coordinator recruitment and retention
committees

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
they've identified this to be a
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
significant problem too throughout the
 
00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.190 align:start position:0%
significant problem too throughout the
state

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.470 align:start position:0%
state
and

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
one that we need to to work towards to
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
fix i can tell you that we
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
surveyed our members
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
um throughout the state to the point
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
that this has no longer become anecdotal
 
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
members that have left the job have told
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
us um in no uncertain terms that it's
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
because of what happened to the
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
retirement system in 2011
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
members that are considering leaving the
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
job have told us the same
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
and so i i have serious concerns over
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
what the fire service looks like over
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
the next 10 years if we don't work
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
towards a fix today
 
00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:33.750 align:start position:0%
towards a fix today
um

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
with that i'd be happy to answer any
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
but i i appreciate all your work on this
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you for putting some thought
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
into it i have one question in your
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
opinion does 1587
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
help fix the issue
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
yes the short answer is yes
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you is we've gone
 
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.110 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you is we've gone
through

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
fire departments throughout the state
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
and we've talked to them about this
 
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.710 align:start position:0%
and we've talked to them about this
issue

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that with all the changes
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
that occurred to the retirement system
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
back in 2011 this was one of the issues
 
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.870 align:start position:0%
back in 2011 this was one of the issues
that

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't one of the glaring issues because
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
there were so many other bigger nastier
 
00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:11.830 align:start position:0%
there were so many other bigger nastier
changes

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system this was one
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
that kind of got lost in the shuffle
 
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.070 align:start position:0%
that kind of got lost in the shuffle
right

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
but now that we've drawn so much
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
attention to it we've educated our
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
members on it i can tell you
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
firefighters and and i'm certain that
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
the police officers can speak the same
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
and corrections can do so
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
they're not happy because they feel like
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
they were bamboozled to some degree um
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
this one this one was kind of hidden uh
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
buried deep in the retirement language
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
that um you know it takes some time to
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
dig up and and really see what's
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
happening here but now these
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
firefighters are realizing they're
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
paying 11.8 percent on every single
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
dollar that they earn to the retirement
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
system and they're not seeing that money
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh at the end of the day or at the end
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
of their careers rather
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
so i do i i
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
i would be lying to you if i sat up here
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i told you i think that this is
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
this is the silver bullet fix
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
everything's going to be grand after
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
this but i do think that it is a
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
significant step
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
in a in a good direction towards
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining and and recruiting
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
firefighters throughout the state of new
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire okay thank you any other
 
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.590 align:start position:0%
hampshire okay thank you any other
questions

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.190 align:start position:0%
questions
yes

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for all that you
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
do certainly not easy and i appreciate
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
it and your testimony today
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
when recruiting
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
or when discussing with new hires the
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
retirement system here they are brand
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
new to the scene
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
what is the i guess elevator speech in
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
other words the summarize summary you
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
would give a brand new person about the
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
retirement system and the benefits
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
offered thereof upon their joining
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um i can tell
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
you it
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
more than likely it varies from
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
department to department um
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you is when i started
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
about 16 years ago the pitch was that to
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
be a public servant in the state of new
 
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.310 align:start position:0%
be a public servant in the state of new
hampshire

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
you worked hard the money wasn't you
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
weren't going to get rich off of it but
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of your career you were going
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
to have a thoughtful pension that was
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
going to be worth all the time and
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
dedication that you put in towards a
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
career in public service
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
i can tell you now
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
we're unable to make that pitch
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
because of what the system is now
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
um i will tell you
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're still
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
i i'm not going to tell you your
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
retirement at the end of your career is
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
horrible now i i don't think that that's
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
fair to say but i can certainly say it's
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
not a huge selling point for new
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
candidates coming on now to let them
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
know that um you know you may come in at
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
45 000 a year base salary but if you
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
work hard and you put in 25 years
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a good pension and
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
so i can tell you representative at this
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
point we're not really using that much
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
all set any other questions yes
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just briefly because
 
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
sitting on edna i heard a lot of this
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
testimony but i just want to reiterate
 
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.029 align:start position:0%
testimony but i just want to reiterate
that

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
from what we hear with the shortage
 
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.110 align:start position:0%
from what we hear with the shortage
in

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
the trouble of getting new recruits into
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
relies on overtime to fill those missing
 
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
relies on overtime to fill those missing
positions

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
and that overtime that
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
these employees are paying into the
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system on and end up being
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
their best years of their career while
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
they're being forced into that overtime
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
is it not true that they will not see a
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
benefit for those extra hours paid
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for the question uh
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative yes so many of our
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
members are being forced now to work
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
overtime to cover these vacant positions
 
00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:01.909 align:start position:0%
overtime to cover these vacant positions
um

00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:02.950 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day we can't
 
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.350 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day we can't
have

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
fire trucks with no firefighters on them
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
we can't have police cars with no police
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
officers in them and we can't have
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
prisons with no corrections officers so
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
these folks are being forced in to work
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
in many cases
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
putting in hundreds of hours
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
of mandatory overtime away from their
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
families away from their homes and
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of the the story
 
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.110 align:start position:0%
at the end of the the story
these

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
the the percentages that they're paying
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
on all this overtime towards a
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
retirement system they're not seeing in
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
their calculation at the end of their
 
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.149 align:start position:0%
their calculation at the end of their
careers

00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
careers
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
okay and i'll ask you again do this 1587
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
start to unravel that problem yes okay
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%

00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
explain to you why this bill is so
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
important to law enforcement throughout
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
our state
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
first let me say that 10 years ago when
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
numerous changes were made to the
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
state's retirement program it was
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
impossible to anticipate the
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances that would develop like we
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
have today
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
but some of those changes laid the
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
foundation for hiring and retention
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
problems by altering provisions and
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
benefits that had been agreed to when
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
some members were hired fast forward to
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
2022 the state of new hampshire and just
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
about every city and town are facing
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
serious employment challenges in the
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
public safety area especially law
 
00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.070 align:start position:0%
public safety area especially law
enforcement

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
our state have dozens of unfilled
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
positions and local communities are
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
finding the applicant pool to be
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
extremely tight with that cities and
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
towns are competing against each other
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
for not only the limited number of new
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
hires but in retaining existing
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
personnel competition from other states
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
the private sector and in some cases
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
outright burnout are adding to this very
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
concerning public safety problem
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
i want you to know that there is a very
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
concerning out of the ordinary trend
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
developing the number of employees who
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
are leaving before they reach their 20
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
or 25 years is very real
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
that is something none of us could have
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
contemplated just a few years ago
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
the one tool that can help address this
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
problem is strengthening the retirement
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
benefits so there is incentive to stay
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
we believe hb
 
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.750 align:start position:0%
we believe hb
1587

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
1587
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
is the kind of tool that will help in
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
retaining those individuals who might be
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
thinking about leaving early and quite
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
frankly the economics makes sense local
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
communities spend an average about 50
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
000 or more to train certify and equip
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
each new police officer
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
each time one
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
each time one leaves the new higher
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
training costs hit local budgets and
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's if the local community can even
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
find new hires
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
we are very fortunate in this state to
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
have such a dedicated skilled and
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
qualified group of law enforcement
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
officers but the challenges are there
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
for the future
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
i ask you to think hard about this
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
potential crisis and to act before it
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
gets worse we all need to do everything
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
possible to encourage these individuals
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
to work their full pre-retirement terms
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's good for the safety of our
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
citizens in every community keep in mind
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
being a police officer today is a
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
challenging stressful job
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
it is a noble profession it's something
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
that i truly love but every minute on
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
the job is filled with safety concerns
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 1587 will help our state and
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
local communities in their recruitment
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
and retention of qualified police
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
officers i urge you to support this bill
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
yes representative hatch
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
you got to turn your mic
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
i hate these things um
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you have this
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
information or not but i think it's
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
germaine do you have a percentage of
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
personnel that
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
left the department early say in 2010
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
prior to this
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
as compared to what leaves early now i
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
recognize the problem even within my
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
community but do you have some sort of
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
numbers that correlates this or not i
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't have an accurate number sir but
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
however every department has those
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
numbers that we can
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
possibly retrieve um there is there is i
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
hear it all the time a lot of people
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
that have 10 years or less on the on the
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
job they're leaving for the private
 
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.070 align:start position:0%
job they're leaving for the private
sector

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
sector
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
if if that was easily obtained that
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
would be interesting we'll try to do
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
that yeah thank you
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%

how
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
much can we solve in this particular
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
bill i'd entertain a motion for the
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
amendment or do i have any questions on
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
amendment basically
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the basic bill changing
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
is that correct mr hoffman
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
i'm being videotaped now so i want to
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
directed towards uh representative
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
goalie you sat on the policy committee
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
could you tell me what the vote was or
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
to support the legislation as as it's
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
been proposed
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.549 align:start position:0%
okay
sure

00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
i'm very sympathetic to the bill
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
i think we should do
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
what we can do
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
but i know that we don't have the money
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
to do a hundred percent of it and i
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment is a step forward
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
to get us started and
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
if emotion is an honor i'd like to move
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
that we accept this amendment
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay the amendment is 107 4h second okay
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
why don't we do a show of hands i don't
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
think we need a roll call for this one
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
all those opposed
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
okay the amendment passes four to three
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to close the hearing on
 
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:24.070 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to close the hearing on
1587.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
i'll reopen it
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
and recess it till friday at 1.
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
we can do it right at the beginning
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to have three bills on
 
00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:49.669 align:start position:0%
we're going to have three bills on
friday

00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:52.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
it's tough to know where the
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
preponderance of people are here for
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll just we'll take it off the we
 
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.430 align:start position:0%

and i did send it out electronically
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
to several but you should have a letter
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
in front of you
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to speak to some of what i've
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
said here

said here
and

00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
this is regarding the cost of living
 
00:33:06.159 --> 00:33:07.269 align:start position:0%
this is regarding the cost of living
adjustments

00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
for the state retirees
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
when this hearing was opened on this
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
bill it went in as being a reoccurring
 
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.710 align:start position:0%
bill it went in as being a reoccurring
cola

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
cola
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
for all it ended up being amended to be
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
a one-time caller for those that were
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
five years out of retirement had 60
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
months in before july 1st 2017.
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
pre-funded or terminally funded
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
and that was
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
amended by
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
representative carol mcguire in edna
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
that bill got passed 17 to 2
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
and by voice vote on the floor
 
00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:54.070 align:start position:0%
and by voice vote on the floor
um

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
give you some facts in history here we
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
did a like
 
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.830 align:start position:0%
did a like
cola

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
cola
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
basically the same kind of thing
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
this one is 1.5 as well
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
and it's on the first 30 000 per year
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
what i could find from the last delineal
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
retirement commission report was that
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
that in 2017 we had nearly 48 000 public
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
employees that were active contributing
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
plan members that year the trust paid
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
706.3 million in pension benefits to
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
more than 35 000 retirees and
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries making nhrs one of the
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
largest payrolls
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
the state's largest payroll the average
 
00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:45.190 align:start position:0%
the state's largest payroll the average
benefits

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
of with average benefits of 20 thousand
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
so if you equate the one point five
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
times the average of twenty thousand
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
it's only three hundred dollars per year
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
for each employee's cola
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
that amount i
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
from testimony i had heard
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
because the fiscal note wasn't initially
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
done that way
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
it was estimated that in that particular
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
population five years out we had about
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
22 thousand
 
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.069 align:start position:0%
22 thousand
retirees

00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
retirees
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
so that calculation is
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
six million six hundred thousand dollars
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
per year
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
all you know assumptions estimates aside
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
so what i
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
went and did on the back page here
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
is i kind of tried to show you
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
and that is a spreadsheet
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
tried to show you
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
we're starting out with a terminally
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
funded number of 79 million
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
and if you know basically if you divide
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
the 79 million by
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
six million six hundred thousand you get
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
twelve years
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
that would cover 12 years of people's
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
pension what i
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
i mean cola
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
what i hope
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
that you would um consider is on either
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
of these funding mechanisms that are
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
being terminally funded that you think
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
about putting
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
a requirement in the legislation
 
00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
a requirement in the legislation
that

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
creates kind of a special fund so you
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
can see and that they would get interest
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
on that balance
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
so you would get at least the assumed
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
rate of return which is 6.75
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
percent right now
 
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.589 align:start position:0%
percent right now
um

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
you know on that balance and that's what
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
i did in this spreadsheet is i rolled
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
forward that amount from year to year
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
adding back you know an assumed rate of
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
return is met every year which it isn't
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
always but um
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
it has been on average
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
met more
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
than it has not been hit
 
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.750 align:start position:0%
than it has not been hit
so

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm asking
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
you guys to do is to pass this bill
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
pre-funded in some
 
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.910 align:start position:0%
pre-funded in some
manner

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
to put a requirement in to create the
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
special cola fund
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
and to
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
and for the assumed rate of return or
 
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.990 align:start position:0%
and for the assumed rate of return or
whatever

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
is the lowest on a state employee
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
retiree account
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
if the return like in 2020 is 1.1
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
percent that's what we get into our
 
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.790 align:start position:0%
percent that's what we get into our
account

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
if it's 6.75
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if it's higher like 29.6 likes
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.670 align:start position:0%
last year
then

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
we get 6.75
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
in our account
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
because these employees are five years
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
out i can tell you from my own numbers
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
that before i exhaust my personal
 
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.430 align:start position:0%
that before i exhaust my personal
account

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'm eight years out for my pension and
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
any cola that we would add which is
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
minor and so you have three years of
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
roughly three years depending on how far
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
people are if they're between five and
 
00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.550 align:start position:0%
people are if they're between five and
eight

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
they would have some of this money would
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
be paid out of their account first and
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
so it won't be coming out of the corpus
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
of this account it would be coming out
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
of their personal retirement accounts
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
because that's how it it works until you
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
exhaust all your funding in your
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
personal account it doesn't come out of
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
the corpus of the fund
 
00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:18.950 align:start position:0%
the corpus of the fund
so

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
i hope you'd consider because
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
that was a pretty high number but i can
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
hear what you're doing with the other
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
bill so i hope you consider at least
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
partially funding this one if not
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
totally funding the 79 million i think
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
that would be a step in the right
 
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.310 align:start position:0%
that would be a step in the right
direction

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.829 align:start position:0%
direction
and

00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's much needed it has we haven't had a
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
regular kohler we need to create a
 
00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.750 align:start position:0%
regular kohler we need to create a
mechanism

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
so that we can you know
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
have those changes somewhere along the
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
way that we can we made huge returns in
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
the last so if you look down further
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
in my letter i quote again at the close
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year the retirement
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
system's net position held in trust was
 
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.910 align:start position:0%
system's net position held in trust was
11.57

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
11.57
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
billion an increase of approximately
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
2.44 billion over the prior year an
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
all-time high for the system
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
additionally it was stated that nhrs
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
realized a
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
209.4 sorry not 29.6
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
return on investments in the fiscal year
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
ending june 30th 21 well above
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
the retirement's assumed rate of return
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
of 6.75 and the highest one-year return
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
in more than 30 years it was important
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
to note that these investment returns
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
are for a single year and we need to be
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
considered in the context of portfolios
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
performance over time
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
and compared to the assumed rate of
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
return the 3 5 10 20 and 25 year return
 
00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:45.270 align:start position:0%
return the 3 5 10 20 and 25 year return
periods

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
periods
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
were 11.4 11.3 9.3 7.2 and 7.9
 
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.069 align:start position:0%
were 11.4 11.3 9.3 7.2 and 7.9
respectively

00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
respectively
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
all returns are net of fees as you can
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
see none of these accumulated returns
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
even out to
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
your return are lower than 6.75
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
we had a factor you know at the time
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
this bill was proposed
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
was that local government center and
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
individuals were against it even though
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
it was modest because they just couldn't
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
support any more impact
 
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.550 align:start position:0%
support any more impact
to

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
to their percentages they pay in locally
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's not the case here you know and so
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
they were supportive of the bill as long
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
as they'd have to pay for it in their
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
rates and so
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
i do hope
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
that you will consider
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
funding this or you know and with the
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
same kind of premise as what you just
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
passed a little while ago
 
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.710 align:start position:0%
passed a little while ago
and

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman on friday there was
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
some discussion about an amendment to
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
bring this from 12 to
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere in between is that still
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
i do have an amendment
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay a rather kludgy amendment now that
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
there's more details which will have to
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
be amended i'm i'm sure
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
the idea was to try to do what we can in
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
year yeah uh
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't be a one-time thing
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
go into their pension as a cola like
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
they would i'm sorry yeah well why don't
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
you pass pass out the amendment because
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
i think we'll probably have to amend the
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
amendment then okay
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
but the idea is we
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
concur with the concept
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's the the dollars are a little
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
of a stretch
 
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.270 align:start position:0%
of a stretch
yeah

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
makes it a
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
a cola for the current biennium
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i use i use i pull the number out of
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
the air quite honestly
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
i wasn't off you said it'd be six point
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
six at one well that's what i had for
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
facts so your facts are better than my
 
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.030 align:start position:0%
facts so your facts are better than my
facts

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
facts
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's what i could pull from reports
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's the most recent information i
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
could pull which is the average of 20
 
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.750 align:start position:0%
could pull which is the average of 20
000

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i heard
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
the number 22 000 people so it's pretty
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
easy to do those numbers then
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
this works out to about 340
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
if you yeah it would be more than one
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
point yeah you wouldn't need eight
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
million it would it would depend on what
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
your base is
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh what what the percentage would be i
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
did it the other way around if we do it
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
from saying it's going to be one and a
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
half percent cola
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
based on the dollars then it's 6.6
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
million rather than eight
 
00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:53.430 align:start position:0%
million rather than eight
th

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
th
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
and we can fix that whatever makes the
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
most sense yeah because this is me
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
making it up
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
yeah instead yeah it's a considered a
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
one-time cola in this bill still but
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's meant to go into the base
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
so that's where the bigger dollars come
 
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.670 align:start position:0%
so that's where the bigger dollars come
in

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i guess what i'm saying on my
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet is we don't need quite that
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
much money but
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
um you know from what i can see because
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
these people aren't increasing they've
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
retired for five years
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
and so i think if we add that one factor
 
00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:30.150 align:start position:0%
and so i think if we add that one factor
of

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
making it a special count
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
and then adding the you know the assumed
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
rate of return added every year this
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
money sits there that will be a huge
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
gain on both of these actions you know
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if you have to put it
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
in legislation to do that but i think
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
you would but i don't know that and um
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
and i do think that's an important
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
difference so
 
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.750 align:start position:0%
difference so
um

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
if i was to make an amendment to this i
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
would say it's not just um
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
a one-time it's a cola that we're gonna
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
try to fund
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
going in the future so i would change
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
something to that effect so that
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
they will get it into the corpus of
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
their fun and we should
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
doubled that i would think we would have
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
enough money to keep us going for a
 
00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:20.550 align:start position:0%
enough money to keep us going for a
while

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you can do that or maybe
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know but um
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
i think what you would see in that
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
reporting is you would see if they added
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
the interest that it it negates some of
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
the payments and it might not be as high
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
as we think and we would know more
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
information going forward because i do
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
like the idea that we
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
pre-fund some of these expenses in the
 
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.150 align:start position:0%
pre-fund some of these expenses in the
future

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
and so i think that will be
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
really helpful
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
and could you do you have a copy for a
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
letter uh yeah
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
all right out so i want to make sure
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's in the file
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman again for the
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is arthur beaudry i
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
represent the new hampshire state
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
permanent firefighters retirement
 
00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.910 align:start position:0%
permanent firefighters retirement
association

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
um i am a captain a retired captain of
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
manchester fire department and i was on
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
the retirement system
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
as a board of trustee um i'm glad we got
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
to see this amendment
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
before you
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
adjourn today
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
i respect what you're doing and i know
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's only limited funds to give
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
cost of living raises but the concern i
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
have with the amendment is b
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
and what you're stating is you have
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
anybody that makes over thirty thousand
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
dollars would get nothing um where at
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
least in the past
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
the bill that's written um
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
everybody would get something up to
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
their first thirty thousand dollars so
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
if i made thirty thousand one dollar i
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
get i wouldn't receive any stipend um if
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
that could be changed to um
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh include everybody
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
then i can understand what you would try
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
to do and actually would be beneficial
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
to some of the lower income people as i
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
testified last week
 
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.910 align:start position:0%
testified last week
that

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:20.710 align:start position:0%
that
i

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'll give you the number of people that
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
um it was a substantial number um
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
that make less than 20 it's uh 64 make
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
less than 25 000 so if you're gonna give
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
them 340
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
that that's actually more than a one and
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
a half percent raise which would be
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
beneficial to them because they're lower
 
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.470 align:start position:0%
beneficial to them because they're lower
income

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
earners but to eliminate anybody that's
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
making over the 30 000 i think you're
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
going to be hurting a lot of people out
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
there that are right in that fringe
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
so if that could be amended to the first
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand the first thirty
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i would answer any questions
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else like to speak on this
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh for the record
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
marty carlin from the new hampshire
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
retirement system has no position on the
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
original bill or this amendment i just
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh for informational purposes i just
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to come up um
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
and share a couple of points um
 
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:50.829 align:start position:0%
and share a couple of points um
the

00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
the at your request through the lba we
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
we ran the numbers on
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment with anyone who made less
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
than 30 000 who was retired more than
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
five years and that that's approximately
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
23 500 individuals receiving a benefit
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
right now so a one-time payment you just
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
be you know
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
multiplying the dollar amount of what
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
you want to pay by x you know to get
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
that to get the bottom line um to mr
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
beaudry's point uh the original bill was
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
for anyone who was retired um prior to
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
july july 1st of 17 or earlier and there
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
i don't have an exact number on that
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
today but that that was somewhere
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
between you know 29 500 and 330 000
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
people i can
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
send that over uh to lba okay if you're
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
interested in expanding it you know
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
again you just you'll be tying the
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
number by the benefit
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
and um as a technical matter on the
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
amendment and i don't have language in
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
front of me because i hadn't seen the
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
amendment but if i could
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
propose the committee to consider
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
another section just uh as it's got an
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
effective date of july 1 of 22 if it
 
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.710 align:start position:0%
effective date of july 1 of 22 if it
passes

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
passes
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
and talking to um the folks in the the
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
member side and on the data processing
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
side i
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to you know make
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
that payment right away because there's
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of programming to
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
pull that together so if i could um send
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
over some language about you know
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
this payment will be issued as soon as
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
administratively practicable no later
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
than acts so you know there's a there's
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
a drop dead day but we want to make sure
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
we get all that program correct
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
i think the 18 one we got out like right
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
at the end of august might be a little
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
bit longer this year we've got more
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
projects but you know get it out sooner
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
if you would send that language that
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
would be helpful all right and that's
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
all i had but i'd be glad to answer any
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
questions i would be interested in the
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the if we
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
modify this to be the first 30 000 not
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
just those making less than 30 thousand
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
what would how many people would that be
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
sure thing
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
if you could do that
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's what the intention of this was to
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
get going down the road so we're going
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
to revisit this on friday okay okay
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
i feel like we're making progress you
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
got to put a tick on the wheel but
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
you know we're getting there
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
any amount comments from the board on
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.030 align:start position:0%
the amendment
yes

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
um it looks to me like we're talking 29
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
to 30 000 people
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh for the full
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
full amount
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
that we'd be uh
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
we'd be reducing them of the overall
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
amount by like
 
00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:31.030 align:start position:0%
amount by like
40

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
40
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
and i think the people on the lower end
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
are the ones that really need that money
 
00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:40.150 align:start position:0%
are the ones that really need that money
so

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think the way it's written
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh helps the people on the lower end of
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
the scale
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
so make it just for people earning less
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
than thirty thousand dollars annually
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's written now i don't
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
represent alicia
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh thanks mr chairman i appreciate your
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
efforts to
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
provide some additional benefit
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
through a cola but i do have a question
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
and again maybe uh
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative goalie can help me with
 
00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:16.150 align:start position:0%
representative goalie can help me with
this

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.750 align:start position:0%
this
1.5

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
1.5
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
or 340 dollars as an average
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
i hate to say it seems pretty uh
 
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
insignificant or poor i guess would be a
 
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.670 align:start position:0%
insignificant or poor i guess would be a
better

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
do you know where that one pers 1.5
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
percent came from because i think social
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
security went up greater than that this
 
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.589 align:start position:0%
security went up greater than that this
year

00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:38.470 align:start position:0%
year
yeah

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
i i'm not 100 sure but i i believe you
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
know it was looking at what we could
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
afford as a state going forward to help
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
out these individuals and this was going
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
to be something that was going to be
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
when we looked at it and
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
it was put together by chairman mcguire
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
was by terminally funding it was to make
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
sure that it stayed with them because
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
as we know the last call we gave them
 
00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.230 align:start position:0%
as we know the last call we gave them
are

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
stipend we should call it
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
um they hadn't received anything since
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
then so now they continue to fall back
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
because their pay hasn't gone up where
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
this was looking to
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
fund it going forward so that they would
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
have have that money and they wouldn't
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
lose it and fall behind continue to fall
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
behind as inflation increases
 
00:52:22.079 --> 00:52:24.150 align:start position:0%
behind as inflation increases
um

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
so you know i think it was just looking
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
at a number that we could do something
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
to try and help out going forward and
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
that was um
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
17 to two out of committee and it was a
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
voice vote on the house floor for this
 
00:52:35.839 --> 00:52:37.030 align:start position:0%
voice vote on the house floor for this
proposal

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
and then i will say that
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
it was for
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
the thirty thousand first thirty
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
thousand on all individuals going back
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
to that that if you made 30 000 plus one
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
dollar you get nothing and that was i
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
mean those folks are still struggling at
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
well the concept of this amendment
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
not spend 80 million dollars
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh that we don't have
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's to make a cola for the current
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
current biennium
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh i know we're going to have to revisit
 
00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.870 align:start position:0%
uh i know we're going to have to revisit
it

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh and we'll do that
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
by friday at 1.
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
but i would appreciate a motion on
 
00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.790 align:start position:0%
but i would appreciate a motion on
amendment

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
1073 so we can at least
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
get the concept of a of a current year
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
cola on the deck mr chairman
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
um so so move that motion okay do you
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
have a second second for discussion mr
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
chairman good thank you mr lisa
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
so i would be
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know certainly being a fiscally
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
conservative democrat support the idea
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
of not going out 12 years or 20 years or
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
whatever and just keeping it for the
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
existing period
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
as the amendment states but i would hope
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
that we would do everyone for the 1.5
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
percent not just those under the 30
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
percent okay
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
so your your
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
modification to this amendment would be
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
to make it at 1.5 percent yeah for the
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
first thirty thousand for the first
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
can i do a straw vote on on this because
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
we have two two options one is to say
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
people making thirty thousand or less
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
and the other one is
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
every everybody but only on the first
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand
 
00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:35.829 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand
so

00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
just a straw vote if you're if you're in
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
favor of thirty thousand or less as the
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
option raise your hand
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay if you're interested in
 
00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.109 align:start position:0%
okay if you're interested in
all

00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
retirees first thirty thousand raise
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
00:54:51.599 --> 00:54:53.670 align:start position:0%
your hand
okay

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
then i would call for a show of hands on
 
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.470 align:start position:0%
the amendment
1073

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
1073
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
i think from what we just did we need to
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
change the amendment before we roll it
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
in i'm going to change it for friday
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay that's good
 
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.150 align:start position:0%
okay that's good
um

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%

and we're going to
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
be changed
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
no as it is now i'm
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
we have to vote on what we got
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair if i may just for a procedural
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
manner um can we not

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine the simple dutchman i mean
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to get the concept of it's
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
a current year coal only and we're not
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
going to solve the problem forever
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
i agree with that mr chairman okay then
 
00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.950 align:start position:0%
i agree with that mr chairman okay then
we'll

00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
we will
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
suspend a vote on this and we i will
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
recess this hearing this work session
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
okay i think we have uh several
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
1540

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
1540
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
so i would open the work session on
 
00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:35.270 align:start position:0%
so i would open the work session on
1540.

00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
1540.
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%

unh law where i've been for 28 years
um

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm speaking
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
on my own behalf my opinions do not
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
reflect those of either the portsmouth
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
i am
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
in support of
 
00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:23.670 align:start position:0%
in support of
1540

00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
1540
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
to go directly what it does is it
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
requires police departments to in some
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
fashion record
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
interrogations as defined in the
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
it does not require the recording
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't fit the definition of
 
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.630 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't fit the definition of
uh

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
of of the aware of where the location is
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh roadside uh interrogations uh after a
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
stop for a motor vehicle violation are
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
not included in this
 
00:57:58.460 --> 00:57:58.470 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:00.549 align:start position:0%
it is not
[Music]

00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's not going to cost police
 
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.230 align:start position:0%
it's not going to cost police
departments

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
much if any money because the majority
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
of police departments at this at this
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
point including the state police already
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
record interrogations
 
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.109 align:start position:0%
record interrogations
um

00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
because the bill says
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
it can be either an audio
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
whether a police department has video
 
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.150 align:start position:0%
whether a police department has video
taping

00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
taping
 
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.230 align:start position:0%
taping
capability

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
capability
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
though i think at this point most do
 
00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:36.270 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:37.990 align:start position:0%
my understanding
[Music]

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
even if they don't they can use an audio
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
recording and
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard of a police department
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
even the smallest police departments who
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to do an audio
 
00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:48.230 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to do an audio
recording

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
recording
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
if only uh with an iphone but you know i
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
think uh historically i practiced uh as
 
00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.430 align:start position:0%
think uh historically i practiced uh as
a

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
public defender for 13 years uh back in
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
as my daughter says in pre-history when
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
dinosaurs run the earth um from 1980 to
 
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.990 align:start position:0%
dinosaurs run the earth um from 1980 to
1994

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
1994
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh even then everybody had uh tape
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
recording uh mechanisms uh even even a
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
small department like new durham or uh
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
ossipee where in the area where i
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
practiced so i don't think this is any
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
it is also i would add
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
as a matter of policy i think it's good
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's good practice for police
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
departments to do this for their own
 
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.109 align:start position:0%
departments to do this for their own
protection

00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
you know one of the issues that's
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
frequently litigated uh in criminal
 
00:59:39.599 --> 00:59:40.630 align:start position:0%
frequently litigated uh in criminal
cases

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh pre-trial is whether the individual
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
invoked his right to remain silent or
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
his right to counsel or whether he
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
waived his miranda rights and uh
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyers litigate that
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
frequently the extent to which there is
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
a recording of both the the reading of
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
miranda and any waiver of miranda and
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
the entire interrogation it's going to
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
diminish the ability for any if for
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
those hearings to even occur let alone
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
be successful um you know anecdotally
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of at least two states where
 
01:00:15.839 --> 01:00:17.349 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of at least two states where
um

01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
the criminal defense lawyer associates
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
association opposed this bill uh because
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
they didn't want that to happen
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
um there are 30 states who have some
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
version of this bill um so uh we're not
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
asking uh the state of new hampshire to
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
go out on a limb and do something nobody
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
else is doing um
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know as as uh one of the
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
i i would uh point out i believe uh the
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
national innocence project
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
sent um a letter to the committee
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh in support of this bill you know one
 
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
most significant reasons that we see
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
wrongful convictions in the united
 
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.630 align:start position:0%
wrongful convictions in the united
states

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
that is convictions we know are wrongful
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
because dna evidence has
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
exculpated the person convicted
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 27 or 28 of those
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
involve false confessions it's really a
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
stunning number if you think about it
 
01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.150 align:start position:0%
stunning number if you think about it
and

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
very often there are people
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
with uh diminished
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
intellectual ability
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
people who english is not their first
 
01:01:28.799 --> 01:01:29.829 align:start position:0%
people who english is not their first
language

01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
um or who have some uh mental health
 
01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.950 align:start position:0%
um or who have some uh mental health
issues

01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh and all those groups tend to be more
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable in an interrogation which you
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
know it's a very
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
even for the average person a scary
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
circumstance they tend to be
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
particularly vulnerable uh and uh you
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
know that that number is
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
i've been doing work with the innocence
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
project since uh
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
the first part of this century and uh to
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
this day that number is breathtaking to
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
me that there's that number of people
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
um who have been proven to have given
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
false confessions to confess to
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
something they didn't do and end up
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
going to jail
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
for many years sometimes
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
so uh this is a
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
relatively simple bill it's pretty
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
straightforward it's not going to cost
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
any money it may cost a little bit for
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
those departments who choose to upgrade
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
to audio visual recording
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
other than that i'm more than willing to
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.309 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony thank
you

01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
going through this
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh one of the areas that i i find a bit
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
troubling is you if you go to page 2
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
line 23
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
it speaks to
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
presumption of inadmissibility
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
and my reading of this and you can
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong my reading of
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
this is that if you are
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
doing recording
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
testimony

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.829 align:start position:0%
testimony
unrecorded

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
unrecorded
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
it negates you recorded as well as that
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
which was
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
not recorded
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
i knew i was reading it wrong
 
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
that provision uh the baseline of that
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
provision is if it's not recorded
 
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.029 align:start position:0%
provision is if it's not recorded
that

01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
you can show that there was a good
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
reason for it not being recorded and
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
therefore uh it will get past that
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
presumption of inadmissibility so it's
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
not an absolute it's never going to be
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
admissible there is a there's a uh
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's lack of a better way of
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
putting it it shifts the burden if it's
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
unrecorded then you've got to show
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
there's a good reason for it being
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
unrecorded now if there's a recorded
 
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.230 align:start position:0%
unrecorded now if there's a recorded
confession

01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
confession
 
01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.230 align:start position:0%
confession
um

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.349 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
and the subsequent confession
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
happened in a set of circumstances that
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
fit the legislation that is it's not a
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know random comment somewhere where
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
recording was not possible
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
then that presumption will apply but but
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
then again you still have the
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um to show that there was
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
a reason for it so
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
the idea the idea is
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
we recognize we we don't want to make
 
01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.270 align:start position:0%
we recognize we we don't want to make
the

01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
circumstance of recording confessions
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
too rigid
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
we want to appreciate that i would use
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
an expletive but uh it would be
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
inappropriate that stuff happens
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
i think there's flexibility in the bill
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
to deal with those circumstances so it's
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
not a rigid
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
if you don't record it it's not going to
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
come in be it after an originally
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
recorded confession or even at the front
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
end it's uh you gotta it's up to you now
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
to show us why
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh it didn't get recorded and uh i think
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
my expectation is courts will be pretty
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
charitable for reasonable ex reasonable
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
excuses would it be would it be
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to put in there that it
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
could be written and
 
01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.069 align:start position:0%
could be written and
signed

01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
signed
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
and not recorded
 
01:05:29.599 --> 01:05:31.029 align:start position:0%
and not recorded
uh

01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
starts to get to a situation that's
 
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.069 align:start position:0%
starts to get to a situation that's
problematic

01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
most of the innocence project wrongful
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
convictions that involved false
 
01:05:46.799 --> 01:05:48.150 align:start position:0%
convictions that involved false
confessions

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
confessions
 
01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.349 align:start position:0%
confessions
involved

01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
signed confessions
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's not a provision that
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
would give the kind of protection
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
that this bill is designed to give um to
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
be very straightforward with the chair
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
it um
it's

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
create a circumstance in which someone
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
is falsely confessing
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
and all they have to do is sign it
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know frequently you see some of the
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
cases out there uh wrongful convictions
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
you see
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh the police wrote the confession for
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
the individual and then they signed it
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
for example in a uh esl circumstance
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
english's second or third or fourth
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
language very frequently you see the
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
police wrote the confession then and
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
then the individual and they say just
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
sign this now that we read this and sign
 
01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:44.309 align:start position:0%
sign this now that we read this and sign
this

01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
that provision
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
would would
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
take away the kind of solid protection
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman i was just curious if
 
01:07:01.359 --> 01:07:02.390 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman i was just curious if
anyone

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
was in the audience from criminal
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
justice because i actually find your
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
take um also problematic as i read this
 
01:07:10.079 --> 01:07:10.789 align:start position:0%
take um also problematic as i read this
but

01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
not to put our member to my left on the
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
spot who is an attorney
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
if she has any comments but it seems a
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
little problematic to me
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
your description as well i do see that
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
clause uh as a legislator now talking as
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
a legislator quite
 
01:07:33.039 --> 01:07:34.150 align:start position:0%
a legislator quite
strict

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
strict
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
to the contrary of what you're saying so
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
definitely some language here to reflect
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
your comments about there being a
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
reasonable excuse or a good uh reason
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so forth for the recording not
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
taking place at the time because words
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
in this provision like not all any shall
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
that is rigid
 
01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.750 align:start position:0%
that is rigid
um

01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
two answers one i don't have the
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
legislation right in front of me so i
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's page 2 lines 23 through 27. i
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
and while you're reading that i'll just
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
make a comment i did talk to the
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
department of justice ahead of the
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
criminal division and
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
his reading on this is that it could
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
punish a victim
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
if an officer doesn't follow
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
this this this and this the victim gets
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
punished because this is inadmissible so
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
that that that was their concern with
 
01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:46.709 align:start position:0%
that that that was their concern with
this

01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.590 align:start position:0%
yes sir
uh

01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure that's well
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
let me go step by step
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
um um i was present uh when criminal
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
justice uh uh uh heard this bill
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
this concern was not addressed i see
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
that representative welch is also here
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
he's he's the prime sponsor on this uh
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
but it was not addressed in criminal
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
justice i i had
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
during my testimony for example i had a
 
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.950 align:start position:0%
during my testimony for example i had a
very

01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
heated is the wrong word i had a very
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
engaged back and forth uh with
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh the person i view as justice lynn
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
former justice lynn now representative
 
01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.669 align:start position:0%
former justice lynn now representative
lin

01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
lin
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
he did not have a problem with that
 
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.470 align:start position:0%
he did not have a problem with that
provision

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
he was very comfortable with that that
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
provision so
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
so that's part one
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
part two
 
01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.110 align:start position:0%
part two
um

01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
i i think uh
 
01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.110 align:start position:0%
i i think uh
594a5

01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
594a5
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
has to be read
 
01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:51.030 align:start position:0%
has to be read
uh

01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.390 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
in the context of 594 a6
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
which says it it talks about overcoming
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
the presumption i don't think uh 595 a5
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
lines 23 for 27 can be read without also
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
thinking about uh the following uh
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
provision 595
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh 594a colon six
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
where it says the presumption of
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
inadmissibility of statements provided
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
in a5 may be overcome
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
um and any statements that were not
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
electronically recorded may be admitted
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
if the court fines
 
01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:31.350 align:start position:0%
if the court fines
etc

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
etc
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
um so i i that's that's where that
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
flexibility comes into place and it i
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
think it i believe and uh i
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
welcome uh further questions from
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative leishman or mooney or or
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
the chair i believe that takes care of
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
the concern
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
that if you read a5 independent of a6 i
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
would have also
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i i don't
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh i don't want um i don't want this to
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
be a richard bill i i was very involved
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh with uh representative uh welch in
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
drafting this bill and the goal was to
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
make this
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
put some flexibility in there
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that does it
 
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.310 align:start position:0%
and i think that does it
okay

01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.390 align:start position:0%
okay
comments

01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to add thank you for that
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
and i would make mention i would amend
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
that section a5
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
reference then a6 to avoid the trap we
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
just fell down
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i i have no problem at reading uh
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
a5 reading except this provided in rsa
 
01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.070 align:start position:0%
a5 reading except this provided in rsa
594

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
594
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
a colon 4 and rsa 594 colon a6 if it's
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
that language we're adding in there i
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
i'm completely comfortable with that not
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
that my comfort matters keep us out of
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
the pit
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman just quickly a gentleman
 
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
from the audience would like to comment
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my name is john sonia
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm a lieutenant with the new hampshire
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
state police i am the commander of the
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
homicide bureau my last name is spelled
 
01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.270 align:start position:0%
homicide bureau my last name is spelled
s-o-n-i-a

01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
and uh just listen to the testimony of
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
professor sheer
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
i was a little concerned as you pointed
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
out mr chair but i do agree with
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative mooney that
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
a fix like that would probably be
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to to reference that next area
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
in the statute i appreciate you
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
referencing the doj i think it's more
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
applicable that they speak on
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
this is a lot of legislation it's two
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
pages full of amendment and even when i
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
read it this morning as professor shear
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
just did it becomes complex especially
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
if you're doing it for the first time as
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
he just indicated so it's
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's i think some examination is
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate as as you did on this
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee um what that means if that
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
means again coming back friday and
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
asking doj to send a representative i
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
think it's it's not only important to
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that it doesn't conflict with
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
itself but it doesn't also conflict with
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
other statutes and laws i know that some
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
of the first testimony brought by uh now
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
major ebert was it could conflict with
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh some of the one-party statute uh laws
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
also so it's important with legislation
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
this long and this
 
01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.430 align:start position:0%
this long and this
um

01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
this wordy that it i guess the legal
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
scholars do have input on it and maybe
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
come in to testify before you uh
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
presenting that so
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
any i could take any questions from the
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
committee that they might have also um
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
again i just read it this morning also
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
as a fill-in so but that was part of
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
just listening to testimony i appreciate
 
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.310 align:start position:0%
just listening to testimony i appreciate
that

01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
i think it should be amended to address
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
oh i think john's got a great idea
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
because i look at um
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
line 30 on page two and then we were
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
using the word may be admitted again so
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'd really like to hear from the justice
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
department and
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
because i still share the concerns that
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
you have mr chairman okay
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
but overall our homicide unit does
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
practice utilizing at least audio
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
recordings so we feel in the last few
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
years we've been at the forefront of
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
this i think it is important um to
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
really button this up so it can be
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
utilized in the future but not be
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
limiting because some language was
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
missed in there okay
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to lift the hood on the
 
01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.830 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to lift the hood on the
car

01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
car
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
for another issue
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
this appears to be
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
a um
 
01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.390 align:start position:0%
a um
downshift

01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
downshift
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we're requiring
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
i mean at least when you when you start
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
reading it sounds like here's what
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to do
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
and if there's an associated cost with
 
01:14:59.120 --> 01:14:59.910 align:start position:0%
and if there's an associated cost with
that

01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
then we get the downshifting
 
01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.910 align:start position:0%
then we get the downshifting
problem

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that we change this to
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
be an enabling
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that says if you're going to
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
do recording
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
this applies
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
if your
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
municipality town
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
elects not to do a recording
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't apply
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
so that we're not forcing recordings
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts from anybody
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative i appreciate your point
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
but as pointed out
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:36.229 align:start position:0%
i think
most

01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
or proponents of individuals who take
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
confessions have access to some sort of
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
recording device without an additional
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
purchase by any
 
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.870 align:start position:0%
purchase by any
um

01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
sub-political division of the state i
 
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.630 align:start position:0%
sub-political division of the state i
mean

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
and to have this optional
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
in my mind would bring us back to right
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
where we are right now
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
and why even bother doing it if it's
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
optional in my
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
mind but um i could be wrong but that's
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think correcting the language so it's
 
01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.270 align:start position:0%
i think correcting the language so it's
clear

01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
and understandable i think would
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
probably be the best approach okay thank
 
01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.630 align:start position:0%
probably be the best approach okay thank
you

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair if i may um because
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
the our homicide unit travels throughout
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
the state um the the point is well taken
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
that there are some departments that are
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
very small and and even though we can
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
make the assumption has been stated in
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
testimony it doesn't cost them a lot
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's easy to do
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
it may not be it may not be in in uh
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
colebrook new hampshire where we've been
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
on cases um because their resources are
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
much more limited
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
along with the same conversation about
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
making sure the language is correct and
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
it it kind of covers all the bases and
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
not jumping forward too quickly
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
it might be one you know take into
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
account like we had mentioned we all
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
seem to have cell phones nowadays we
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
have more ability to record than ever
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
before personally however
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the recordings for
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
criminal cases in court that that is
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
evidence it becomes evidence
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
we get issued digital recorders in our
 
01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:16.470 align:start position:0%
we get issued digital recorders in our
unit

01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
so each detective homicide detective can
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
take that with them anywhere they go
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
that availability isn't everywhere but
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's also evidence you're recording
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
criminal evidence on that device and
 
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
then you're producing it to court later
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
so another concern might be to button up
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
the language because
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh small departments that may not have
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures as the state
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
police do
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know we're able to take that medium
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
copy it to a disk a thumb drive pass it
 
01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.229 align:start position:0%
copy it to a disk a thumb drive pass it
on

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
memorialize it as evidence and then pass
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
it forward to prosecution maintaining
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
that chain of custody not everyone has
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
that and we certainly might want to
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
button up the language so we're not
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
having local police departments just
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
utilize their personal cell phone that
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
come evidenced in a criminal case later
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
on um or examined for that purpose um so
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
there there is maybe more thought
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
process to go into legislation to talk
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
about policies procedures for the
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
overall new hampshire law enforcement
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
community as far as departments and and
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
within consideration of their various
 
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.430 align:start position:0%
within consideration of their various
size

01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
size
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for me on that
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
thanks john
 
01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:27.590 align:start position:0%
thanks john
uh

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
it would appear to me and again you've
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
been doing this a long time but having
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
recordings of interrogations or whatever
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
is probably more beneficial
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
to the department to prove perhaps what
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
was said or going on versus just
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
some written statement that someone
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
could challenge later absolutely yeah
 
01:18:46.159 --> 01:19:01.910 align:start position:0%
could challenge later absolutely yeah
thanks

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
justice we we and public safety we
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
talked about the
 
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:08.830 align:start position:0%
uh the issue of chain of custody and
 
01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:11.189 align:start position:0%
uh the issue of chain of custody and
[Music]

01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:11.199 --> 01:19:12.070 align:start position:0%
[Music]
again

01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
a good part of that was with
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call him representative
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
justice lynn
 
01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.510 align:start position:0%
justice lynn
and

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.030 align:start position:0%
and
and

01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
i think the general feeling was
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
when you make policy changes
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
when you want to make policy changes
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
it is not a sufficient reason that
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
police departments will have to develop
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
new policies not to make the policy
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
change i mean i think
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
change to some extent to the extent this
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
is a change it's not a dramatic one
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
means some police departments may have
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
to develop certain policies but you know
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
the state police has a policy on this uh
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
some other portsmouth uh of which i'm
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
quite familiar has a policy on this you
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
know that they can they can import those
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
policies from other departments so i
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that the concern about
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
policy change uh at the department by
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
department level is is one that gets in
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
the way of this
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh and second uh you know i
 
01:20:14.639 --> 01:20:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh and second uh you know i
uh

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
we can talk about this forever which i
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
hope not to in spite of being a law
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
professor um but
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's not going to cost money we're not
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
done shifting costs
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
we just aren't
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's if
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
if a officer in a very small department
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
records it on his personal iphone he can
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
very quickly send that to the prosecutor
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
in the case and that's not going to be a
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
chain of custody i i
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
um i i teach a course called evidence
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
which among other things i teach
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
students about the rules surrounding
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
chain of custody and getting things into
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
into court
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
and that procedure i just described will
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
be sufficient
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
you don't have to document every step
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
you just have to have the officer come
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
into court when the recording is played
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
and say yup this is i listened to that
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
recording just before i came into court
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what that person said and
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
this is a recording of what that person
 
01:21:20.719 --> 01:21:21.510 align:start position:0%
this is a recording of what that person
said

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
that will take care of the chain of
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
custody uh circumstance so it's
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to try to legislate
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
at a statutory level chain of custody
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
issues that really don't exist or to
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislate what policies individual
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
departments have to deal with audio or
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
audio visual recordings i think that's
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
what police departments uh do
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
all the time they develop policy and
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
they they share amongst each other uh
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
policy changes so i think that's um
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know i think this is good
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
legislation and i think
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh cost wise there's going to be no
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
burden on on police departments and
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
policy-wise it's a it's a relatively
 
01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.270 align:start position:0%
policy-wise it's a it's a relatively
minor

01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
minor
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh adaptation on their part
 
01:22:10.639 --> 01:22:13.510 align:start position:0%
uh adaptation on their part
hopefully

01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully john that doesn't have a
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
response so i don't have to get back up
 
01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:20.629 align:start position:0%
response so i don't have to get back up
again

01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
we need you to use a microphone so
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
anybody watching the video can
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't normally i
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
again present professor shear i
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you just said it just
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
you keep using the word no cost no cost
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
no cost i guess
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
there is a cost to somebody and there
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
are some police departments that make
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
them purses their own firearms and as we
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
know farms for a handgun is
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
is not astronomical three four hundred
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
dollars all i'm saying is there are
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
departments that have very low funding
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the state i go throughout the state
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
so i just every time the word no cost is
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
repeated it's a cost to somebody just
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
that consideration is all i'm asking and
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
i know we talked about evidence a little
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
bit my point being that if you
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
if you mandate our police chief mandates
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
we'll just use your own personal cell
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
phone again that's a downshifting across
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
to somebody it may not feel like it but
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
you're putting on that officer to now
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
utilize something he pays for to do a
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
recording for his job to comply with the
 
01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
law that so that i just wanted to add
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
that to the conversation
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
yes sir yeah thank you for your
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
testimony i have a question if an
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
officer uses his personal weapon as well
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
as his personal
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
phone isn't that a liability issue on
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
the department not for the department
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
the department's going to have that
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
training they're going to
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
take him and get him certified on that
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
weapon to utilize it now if he utilizes
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
it in the course of his duties that
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
weapon is probably going to be taken as
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
evidence can be seized by my unit of the
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
state police that does officer involved
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
shootings and they may not see it until
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's adjudicated
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
so you would lose the weapon and you'd
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
have to theoretically go buy a new
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
weapon but it wouldn't it wouldn't
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
impede the system it's just something
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
that they allow their office to do and
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
then they'll go to the range and get
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
certified on it per police standards and
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
training councils criteria
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that clarification
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments about the
 
01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.149 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments about the
bill

01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i i
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the point of it will cost
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
somebody something and i probably don't
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
want to give up my iphone for evidence
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
and lose it for a while but um on amazon
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
i just looked up real quick you can buy
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
a little recording device for 29
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
just that would be adequate for
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
something like that so there there could
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
possibly be a cost but uh cost benefit
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure um
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're there thank you well
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
my point was that we're financed
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i was trying to see
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
what effect this has financially and
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's the only place that i saw was was
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
the potential downshifting yes
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree with you mr chairman
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
because again if you look going back to
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
page two and line six
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
these interrogations at a jail police a
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
sheriff's station holding sell
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
correctional or detentional facility
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
those are all costs
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
someone's going to have to bear those
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
whether you know
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
at a detentional facility do they have
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
that capability now
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
i assume the department of corrections
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
does but i don't know but there's
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
definitely a cost here in my opinion
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
well that's that's why i said that we
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
do we neuter the bill if we make it
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
and basically leaves us where we are
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
right now to representative hatch's
 
01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.870 align:start position:0%
right now to representative hatch's
point

01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh or do we want to have
 
01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:46.470 align:start position:0%
uh or do we want to have
an

01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
idea that we're trying to affect
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so just to get back to your
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
thought about an enabling legislation
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
piece an exception almost for the small
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
departments that officer sonia
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
referenced would you be adding a section
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
roman 3
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
on page 2 to a4 because there is an
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
exception provision
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
so despite all this very harsh you know
 
01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.870 align:start position:0%
so despite all this very harsh you know
shells

01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
shells
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
alls and ease and so forth throughout
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
there is a large exception
 
01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.350 align:start position:0%
there is a large exception
section

01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
that could um with the right language
 
01:26:30.239 --> 01:26:31.510 align:start position:0%
that could um with the right language
make

01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
provisions for the departments that may
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
not have
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
the funds to record what line was that
 
01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:42.629 align:start position:0%
the funds to record what line was that
again

01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
line 35
 
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.070 align:start position:0%
line 35
no

01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
i was actually referring to
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
page 2
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
adding it
 
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
between line
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
lines 22 and 23
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
so it would be part of the a4 exception
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
section which is headed on line 11 of
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
well i was thinking that if we were to
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
add a roman 3 to a4
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
which starts on line 11 section 84
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
starts on line 11.
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
if we were to add a roman 3 that would
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
address the financial exception almost
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.629 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
so the financial
 
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.270 align:start position:0%
so the financial
upset

01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
upset

it that this doesn't apply
 
01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.070 align:start position:0%
it that this doesn't apply
right

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.149 align:start position:0%
right
yeah

01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:27:58.159 --> 01:27:59.189 align:start position:0%
yeah
that

01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
that that's fine that's then it's not
 
01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.910 align:start position:0%
that that's fine that's then it's not
right

01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:04.629 align:start position:0%
right
yeah

01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
under under um
 
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.110 align:start position:0%

a6
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think the financial
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances of you know if it's if
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
it's the uh

um and uh there's nobody there who has
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
a a
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
an i a cell phone they don't have any
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
kind of uh tape recorder they don't have
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
any kind of audio visual equipment
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
i think they fit under the uh
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
the under a6 in terms of ways
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
explanations for them not having
 
01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:51.830 align:start position:0%
explanations for them not having
uh

01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
not being able to record it i think that
 
01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.350 align:start position:0%
not being able to record it i think that
uh

01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
that is that is the point of that
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
exceptional we don't want to make this
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
so rigid that in the circumstances i
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
just described in a freedom new
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire police department we don't
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
want to make it so rigid that that
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
exception can't be that kind of
 
01:29:10.719 --> 01:29:11.990 align:start position:0%
exception can't be that kind of
explanation

01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh the the reason we had the broad a6 is
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:29:17.679 --> 01:29:18.709 align:start position:0%
we can
because

01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is an ambiguous flattery because
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
they're all smart people
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
um you know we can we don't want to be a
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance where we all come up with
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
yet another exception we need to add
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
once you start adding exception after
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
exception after exception for individual
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances i mean you're i'm sure
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
more familiar than i am what a mass
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
legislation turns into when you do that
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's the point of asics you know we're
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
going to leave it to judges if if it's
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
one of those departments i don't you
 
01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.669 align:start position:0%
one of those departments i don't you
know

01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
i used to have practiced in front of
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
every superior court judge but i'm so
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
old now that most of them are retired
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
although some of them are now my
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
students that's how old i am um
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know i i can't imagine a judge in
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
the circumstance i described not saying
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
you you've overcome the presumption and
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
that we're going to admit this we we
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't want a circumstance where a very
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
small police department uh loses a case
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
and a victim
 
01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:17.910 align:start position:0%
and a victim
uh

01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't get the kind of justice that
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
they're owed simply because of that and
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
that's why that exception is there it's
 
01:30:25.679 --> 01:30:27.189 align:start position:0%
that's why that exception is there it's
intentionally

01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
intentionally
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
broad because we want to leave it to
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
judges informed by prosecutors informed
 
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
by defense lawyers informed by
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
lawyers for the victims we want to leave
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
it to judges to
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
is it a is it a reasonable exception
 
01:30:44.159 --> 01:30:46.470 align:start position:0%
is it a is it a reasonable exception
so

01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you yes hopefully i can keep
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
remembering john quiet representative
 
01:30:50.719 --> 01:30:52.870 align:start position:0%
remembering john quiet representative
goalie

01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just i'm glad he's
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
pointing out that section because in
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
reading it
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
part of uh a6 states that for purposes
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
of this statute mere inconvenience or
 
01:31:05.110 --> 01:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
financial expense shall not be
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
considered reasonable justification
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm reading that to say that they
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
shall expend the money to get the
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
equipment because that will not be
 
01:31:13.679 --> 01:31:15.750 align:start position:0%
equipment because that will not be
reasonable

01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:16.470 align:start position:0%
reasonable
yeah

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
i i think yes and no they don't uh if if
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
they've deci if they've made a conscious
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
decision not to spend the money that's
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
one thing but if it's a circumstance
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
that the only member of the department
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
who has the tape recorder or it's being
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
used in another circumstance
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
or the only member of the department who
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
has a cell phone is not there and it's
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
three in the morning
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
then i i don't think
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh that's what that contemplates that
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
that said
 
01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:47.910 align:start position:0%
that said
um

01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
yes you know
 
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
it's possible
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
that there is a police department out
 
01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:54.790 align:start position:0%
that there is a police department out
there

01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
the basic tape recorder
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know of anyone that does
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
that that you know does not have a
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
physical tape recorder and and i think
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
in the theory of this being a
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
downshifting of a cost is there i i
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh but in reality i just don't think
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's very very unlikely that it's
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
there and as representative hatch put
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
pointed out it's very very simple uh and
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
if we're downshifting the cost of 50
 
01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.830 align:start position:0%
if we're downshifting the cost of 50
bucks

01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
bucks
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
to the smaller police departments in
 
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
return for the greater impetus behind
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
this legislation that is
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
we want to have some more protection
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
within reason we want to have some more
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
protection about against the possibility
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
of false confessions
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh and balance that against some smaller
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
police departments will have to spend 50
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
more dollars i mean you know that
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's the consideration that i want all
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
of you to make and i i appreciate all
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
one more cycle
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
based on what everyone was just talking
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
about now
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
i do agree with the point over here
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
about um when you read that it does
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
limit it um and i again i i appreciate
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
professor shir mentioning that it's kind
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
of nice to leave these up to the judge
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
is it is there a way to make
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
mere inconvenience shall not be
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
considered reasonable
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
however financial expense would be up to
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
a judge to determine if that was
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable i guess that the limiting
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
language of
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
you're putting in here shall not you're
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying it the judge is going to
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
read this and say well i can't do
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
anything with that
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
but again if we allow the court system
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
to be the court system and and you know
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
weigh things uh
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
in in different areas maybe
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
a change in the language would be
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
beneficial for that reason to kind of
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
tighten that up and allow the court to
 
01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.629 align:start position:0%
tighten that up and allow the court to
decide

01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative gold do you have any
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
the the only other
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
concern i mean we
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's continuation continue to talk
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
about just
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
voice recordings but if you look on page
 
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.669 align:start position:0%
voice recordings but if you look on page
two

01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh lines three through
 
01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.270 align:start position:0%
uh lines three through
seven

01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
if they are
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
in a custodial interrogation at a jail
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
police or sheriff's station holding cell
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
or correction or detention facility
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
not or whether
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
so if it said or it would work better
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
than and
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
in agreement with that part of the
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
limiting language is it it's talking
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
about the whole facility so i would
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
imagine that the department of
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
corrections or the the county jail
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
system would probably say
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
that would be a huge cost to them
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
because they'd have to
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
have that ability to audio and video
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
record every portion of their facility
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
not knowing when you're going to have uh
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
some some kind of uh
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
place yes representative griffin
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
i thank you mr chair
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of the statue of mary
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
and convenience of financial extension
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
what happens if we just delete that
 
01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.830 align:start position:0%
what happens if we just delete that
sentence

01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
and we rely on
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
the law and the reasonableness of it
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm comfortable uh with uh the uh
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
01:35:52.159 --> 01:35:53.590 align:start position:0%
amendment that
uh

01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh john suggested uh on in terms of the
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
financial circumstances or uh
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%

uh comfortable with making the and and
 
01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.310 align:start position:0%
uh comfortable with making the and and
or

01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
um as before and i'm willing um for for
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
what it's worth um
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to incorporate all that
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
we've talked about uh
 
01:36:17.119 --> 01:36:18.149 align:start position:0%
we've talked about uh
into

01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment and offer it and send it to
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh the chair and members of the
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee just for drafting purposes if
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
if that's appropriate i don't need to
 
01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:30.070 align:start position:0%
if that's appropriate i don't need to
but

01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
i can't be here on friday i am in
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
washington dc learning how to build
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
police stations oh it sounds
 
01:36:38.239 --> 01:36:41.930 align:start position:0%
police stations oh it sounds
enlightening

01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
your point is noted
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
so online on line seven if it end if it
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
ended shall be recorded period
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
then we can go back to the definition of
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
what recordings are
 
01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:01.109 align:start position:0%
what recordings are
yep

01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
is that is that acceptable
 
01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:04.709 align:start position:0%
is that is that acceptable
okay

01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
now as far as line what was the jury 37
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the the sentences starts at the end
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
of line 36
 
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
and goes to through 37.
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
if we just delete that then we're back
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
to the uh
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
594 a
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
six or four or whatever it is that
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
doe talks about the reasonableness of
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
the fund right so then if then there's
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
the judge is not looking at this as an
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
instruction at that point
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
um and and would representative griffin
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
how would you feel about
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
that language uh uh
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
or financial circumstances unless uh
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
well actually i'm trying to build in a a
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism for the judge too i'm just
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
concerned that that some departments are
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
just going to say
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
all right we don't have to do this
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to pay the money
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and and it's 50 bucks i mean that's
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
my concern so i'd like i'd like a a
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
judge to have an opportunity to evaluate
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
whether you know
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
whether the financial circumstances are
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
legitimate you know uh that's i guess
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
that's my only hesitation on what
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative griffin is talking about
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
um i you know i
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
i've probably i've been a lawyer too
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
long i say you know too much
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what my students say
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
yes jerry it seems to me like you made a
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
good case about uh 594 a6 i believe it
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
is yeah
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
that it leads a lot to the judge
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
and my problem with the last sentence on
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
page two is that
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
it takes it away from the judge if we
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
just get rid of the sentence
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
then we're back to
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
mike are you taking notes
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay just one suggestion representative
 
01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:15.750 align:start position:0%
okay just one suggestion representative
so

01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
to representative griffin's point
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
line 36
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
what if it
 
01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:23.590 align:start position:0%
what if it
read

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
read
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
of the surrounding facts and
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances explaining the lack of
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
recording which may include
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
here now the judge would
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
have at least some direction and an
 
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.470 align:start position:0%
have at least some direction and an
example

01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
for why there wasn't a recording and
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
that may include the financial expense
 
01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:49.109 align:start position:0%
that may include the financial expense
piece

01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
does that work i certainly wouldn't have
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
a problem with that and you would put
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the prior sentence
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
end of the first sentence uh the end of
 
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
line 36
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh it would read of the surrounding
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
facts and circumstances explaining the
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
lack of a recording which may include
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
financial expense
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
and then delete the very last line of
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
the bill starting with the words for
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
my only suggestion would be to delete
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
out of that last line or financial
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
expense i i i i
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm a little hesitant to delete
 
01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:45.990 align:start position:0%
i'm a little hesitant to delete
inconvenience

01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
if if that's appropriate
 
01:40:50.709 --> 01:40:50.719 align:start position:0%
i mean i i think given what you
 
01:40:50.719 --> 01:40:52.070 align:start position:0%
i mean i i think given what you
suggested

01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh earlier um you know adding which
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
may include financial expense i think we
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
can delete or financial expense from
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
that last sentence but leave in the word
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
inconvenience yeah that i that makes
 
01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
inconvenience yeah that i that makes
sense

01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.109 align:start position:0%
sense
because

01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
looking at this from 30 000 feet it
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
looks like what we're trying to do is
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
codify best practices yep
 
01:41:16.239 --> 01:41:18.149 align:start position:0%
codify best practices yep

i believe on page two line seven
ends

01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:08.629 align:start position:0%
ends
uh

01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh then uh page 2 line
 
01:42:16.639 --> 01:42:19.590 align:start position:0%
uh then uh page 2 line
36

01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
lack of recording which may include
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
financial expense
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
be added to the
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
first sentence
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
second sentence stays as is with the
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
exception of or financial expense is
 
01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.950 align:start position:0%
exception of or financial expense is

deleted
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
so it says
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
mere inconvenience shall not be
 
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:42.070 align:start position:0%

01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
sidetrack this in any way because as i
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
read through this i certainly have no
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
expertise in this one
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative mooney

called the child support working group
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%

sorry if i mispronounced the name
 
01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:10.870 align:start position:0%
sorry if i mispronounced the name
and

01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of information here it did
 
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
come relatively in last night it would
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
be good to talk to someone from the
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee if
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
they were present but
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
i um
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
let's see this would be interested in
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
hearing more this this came out of
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee otp 8 to 7.
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
yes mr representative griffin
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
um i think our job is is more of the
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
financial cost of this bill and
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
it seems to be
 
01:46:42.719 --> 01:46:45.830 align:start position:0%
it seems to be
indeterminable

01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.350 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
so that's my question is
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
what what would the financial cost of
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
the state be
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
i suspect a lot of that would be u.s
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
government money
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
if if in fact there is a cost
 
01:47:03.679 --> 01:47:05.669 align:start position:0%
if if in fact there is a cost
and

01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully the policy committee
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
has received the information that you
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
have received
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i have to look at this one and say
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
the policy committee to me trump's
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
any idea i would have because i have
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%

01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
could you re repeat your name sure
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
slowly please susan brisson that's
 
01:48:07.679 --> 01:48:12.070 align:start position:0%
slowly please susan brisson that's
b-r-i-s-s-o-n

01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't take a position
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
on this this bill but we
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
could address some of the issues with
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
regards to cost we did do a uh a fiscal
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
note for it
 
01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:29.910 align:start position:0%
note for it
um

01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
when you start well first it
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
changes the self-support reserve from
 
01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:42.550 align:start position:0%
changes the self-support reserve from
120

01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
120
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
of uh the poverty level to up to 150
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
percent which is going to result in more
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
minimum orders for child support which
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
could then
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
result in
 
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
families receiving public assistance so
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
less less child support more public
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
assistance which would then be a cost
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
it's unclear to know you know how many
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
of those cases would happen but it
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.159 --> 01:49:18.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
well the second concern has is is making
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
that the change in the law is not then a
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
reason for
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh the parties to come to court to
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
change their child support order
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh because that would be a basically a
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
run on the court
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
expenses to the court expenses expenses
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
that's kind of sort of just a technical
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
so should there be language in here that
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
addresses that
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
there should be i
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
i forgive me there are several well
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
type builds right now so which which one
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
has which language is uh kind of modeled
 
01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:01.750 align:start position:0%
has which language is uh kind of modeled
but

01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
we are making sure that that that that
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.669 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
representative

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
so your department do you see any
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
additional staff required because the
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
judicial branch says there'll be more
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
time needed for judges case
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
workers marital masters that type of
 
01:50:23.199 --> 01:50:25.910 align:start position:0%
workers marital masters that type of
thing

01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
let's see what else
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
because of the increased amount of work
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch i would assume
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
they may have some cause they said
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
they're indeterminable but do you see a
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
need of hiring additional staff at the
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
department your department
 
01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
we haven't had those concerns um
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's more the the issue of time
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
which could lead to more
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
the need for more staff but it might
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
just be a delay in
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
all cases if each case takes longer
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
things just sort of get pushed pushed
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
down the road a bit
 
01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.270 align:start position:0%
down the road a bit
this

01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
these guidelines are very
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
are turning in
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
our current guidelines are making them a
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
lot more complicated
 
01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.229 align:start position:0%
lot more complicated
um

01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:12.239 --> 01:51:12.950 align:start position:0%
um
they're

01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
similar to what's going on in the state
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
of vermont right right now
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
and it's just longer more complicated
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
obviously we'll get better at it as we
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
go but um
 
01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:24.709 align:start position:0%
go but um
it's

01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
more discussion about
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh parenting time will then
 
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:31.589 align:start position:0%
uh parenting time will then
um

01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
result in having then because the time
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
will then
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
go into
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
for how many nights
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
what's the analysis and uh
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
that that type of thing
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
just oh i'm sorry i'm sorry just a quick
 
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
so your response concerns me because we
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
both know we all know here that the
 
01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:52.470 align:start position:0%
both know we all know here that the
department

01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
is uh hundreds and hundreds of employees
 
01:51:55.199 --> 01:51:56.390 align:start position:0%
is uh hundreds and hundreds of employees
short

01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
short
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
now so
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
by saying this was going to add more of
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
a burden it's going gonna delay things
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's that would be a huge concern of
 
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
mine and probably shared by everybody
 
01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.149 align:start position:0%
mine and probably shared by everybody
here

01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i would say it's a concern what
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
the what the level of it is is is always
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
is always the question um it's unclear
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
to me um
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
how many actual what the actual change
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
because we the cases we deal with
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a range
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
of people we deal with people who don't
 
01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:29.510 align:start position:0%
of people we deal with people who don't
even

01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
we have child support orders that don't
 
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
have parenting
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
um orders themselves they just
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
deal with it they either get along or
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
they don't get along but they don't have
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know court-ordered parenting
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
so we're we're uh
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's where i sort of look at these and
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
go okay well how are we gonna deal with
 
01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:48.470 align:start position:0%
go okay well how are we gonna deal with
that

01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:49.350 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
because of the issues of uh
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
he says i've got the kids you know five
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
nights a week and she says no i've got
 
01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
the kids five nights a week i'm not sure
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
um at least my office you know that's
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
then we have a hearing um which is
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
probably where the
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
the court is looking at
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
you know more hearings but
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
mr representative patch
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
i just uh i need to be caught up because
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
um when you're saying parenting you're
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
amount of time for custody for each
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
custodial parent is that correct the the
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
term custody is not something that we
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
use right well whatever just so i
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
understand it thank you for your
 
01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.030 align:start position:0%
understand it thank you for your
tolerance

01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
tolerance
 
01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:29.910 align:start position:0%
tolerance
um

01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:30.709 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:30.719 --> 01:53:31.910 align:start position:0%
so
uh

01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:32.790 align:start position:0%
uh
what

01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
who adjudicates the fact that when
 
01:53:35.119 --> 01:53:36.070 align:start position:0%
who adjudicates the fact that when
um

01:53:36.070 --> 01:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
the non-custodial parent
 
01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:40.629 align:start position:0%
the non-custodial parent
doesn't

01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
pay their fair share or however you want
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
to say that that goes to the courts
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
correct correct there go the need for
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
more uh judicial staff or whatever in
 
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
but that again you're saying that will
 
01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:55.910 align:start position:0%
but that again you're saying that will
not

01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
have any effect on your workload to the
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
point that
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh additional staff may be needed
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
because um i i would think there's a
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
correlation between the two
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
if i may that's
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to well i unless i don't
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on other than i
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
know my bride
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
counsels many young ladies who are
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
without a husband
 
01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:18.709 align:start position:0%
without a husband
home

01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
and don't get any support and very
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
little help in
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
achieving that but that's neither here
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
nor there so
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
child support has two
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
big areas that we sort of divide into um
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
establishment and then enforcement
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
and this bill i think
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
lands in the is the establishment realm
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
and it's what should child support be
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
then once there's an order
 
01:54:48.070 --> 01:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the number is
 
01:54:49.589 --> 01:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
then we run into
 
01:54:49.599 --> 01:54:50.629 align:start position:0%
then we run into
um

01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:50.639 --> 01:54:51.990 align:start position:0%
um
enforcement

01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
and that's a different sort of a
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
different area that i'm not sure this
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill would affect that much
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
um because the the the order has to be
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
enforced whether it's you know 50 a
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
month or
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
500 a month
 
01:55:05.599 --> 01:55:07.189 align:start position:0%
500 a month
um

01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:07.199 --> 01:55:09.270 align:start position:0%
um
sure

01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
i wonder if i could ask you to monetize
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
you said there would be a cost
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
is it a thousand dollars a hundred
 
01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a million dollars 10
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
what what do you estimate the cost may
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
be of this bill
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
i i i don't have the skills to be able
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
to to be able to do that unfortunately
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
um and as a follow-up uh of course i may
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
well i think we've already had some
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
discussion that i mean if it's if it's
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
more hearings that's
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
from the department that's definitely
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
the court
 
01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:53.669 align:start position:0%
the court
um

01:55:53.669 --> 01:55:53.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
if the parties have to come to court
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
more if there are more hearings
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
they have their sort of assigned costs i
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
was again i'm sort of speculating we
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
don't deal with cases that have too many
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys on the other side it's usually
 
01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:08.070 align:start position:0%
attorneys on the other side it's usually
us

01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then the parties are unrepresented
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
but if this gets incredibly complicated
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
like it sounds like it could
 
01:56:14.639 --> 01:56:16.070 align:start position:0%
like it sounds like it could
um

01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
there might be more people who need
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
attorneys and they'll end up having to
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
to to deal with that cost as well
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
to have a an attorney help them walk
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
so could you tell me what this
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
self-support reserve is and where does
 
01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
the self-support reserve is a number
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's based on the poverty level which
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
is set by the federal government
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
and it's it's not a it's not a figure
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's paid it's a figure that's used
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
when calculating child support and it's
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to represent
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
what the person who pays child support
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
gets to keep for themselves in the first
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
instance to
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
for their own
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
very basic needs like right now it's
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
so in the math
 
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
at a certain point you
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
when you get down to income that's
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
available to pay support you subtract
 
01:57:30.070 --> 01:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
out the self-support reserve
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
that income would which is reserved for
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
the payor and then anything that left
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
that's left over
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
is what child support would come out of
 
01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:40.070 align:start position:0%
is what child support would come out of
okay

01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks mr so that's and that's
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
per month correct okay
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's it'll be it's due to be reset in
 
01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:47.189 align:start position:0%
it's it'll be it's due to be reset in
april

01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
april
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
every every april the the the new
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines are set
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the self-support reserve
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
goes up generally a little bit okay mr
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
hoffman do you have a question
 
01:57:58.320 --> 01:57:59.510 align:start position:0%
hoffman do you have a question
well

01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
possible run on the courts
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%

[Music]

01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
starting at line 25 it's got the
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
language that this act shall not
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
constitute a substantial change in
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances for the purposes of 458 c7
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
which is the modification language so
 
01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
basically it says that
 
01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
that just because this law has changed
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
that is not a reason
 
01:58:56.709 --> 01:58:56.719 align:start position:0%
to revisit it to revisit it you can't go
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
in and say the law has changed i want a
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
new a new child supporter there has to
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
be a separate reason okay
 
01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
um so that's
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's very um
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
helpful on that on that we won't have
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
piling on
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
excuse i have i have a question um
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
what is your correct title for the
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
chief staff attorney
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
seeing them what's the pleasure of the
 
01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:46.070 align:start position:0%
seeing them what's the pleasure of the
committee

01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
i haven't got a clue
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay yeah um
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
yeah mr chairman i'm just kind of
 
02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
curious that
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
this almost seems like a division three
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
issue yeah and maybe run it by them
 
02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:18.790 align:start position:0%
issue yeah and maybe run it by them
first

02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:00:20.709 --> 02:00:20.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is uh
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
we generally don't deal with it as you
 
02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
know the department of health and human
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
services so i think it ended up first
 
02:00:30.629 --> 02:00:30.639 align:start position:0%
because of the judiciary yeah maybe
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
i know we're a difficult lot over here
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
and pretty thorough but i just
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions came up again from
 
02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:38.229 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions came up again from
the

02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
chief staff attorney for the department
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
of health and human services that maybe
 
02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
well as much as i don't want to we will
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
recess this until friday at one and try
 
02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
good thanks ah
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
this should be an easy one
 
02:01:06.189 --> 02:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
you said that before
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
1496 requiring physical subdivisions to
 
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
make motor vehicle
 
02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:13.350 align:start position:0%
make motor vehicle
checklists

02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
checklists
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
voter i'm sorry voter checklist
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
available in spreadsheet this is saying
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
that they can give the
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
voter checklist out in electronic form
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
instead of printed copy
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
i certainly hope we can all agree that's
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
not a
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
mr chair i would move ought to pass oh
 
02:01:45.229 --> 02:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
1496 ought to pass otp
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
let's call a roll and because i
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully we're going to get one through
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
hold on
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
a march motion is not the pass right
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
i'm all set
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
all right if you're on paper you'll vote
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the affirmative if not you'll vote on
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
the negative that being said
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%

uh house bill 1552 which is the last
 
02:02:44.830 --> 02:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
bill under consideration
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
today establishing a board for
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
certification of assessors
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%

comments
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:06.790 align:start position:0%
 
please

02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:03:09.669 --> 02:03:09.679 align:start position:0%
mr chair members of the division for the
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
record lindsey courtney executive
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
director office of professional lease
 
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
courtney c-o-u-r-t anyway
 
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
so oplc does not take a position on this
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill um we provide administrative
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
support to
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
over 54 licensing boards so this would
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
add another one
 
02:03:34.629 --> 02:03:34.639 align:start position:0%
and i think there's some legislation in
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
the works that would also
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
bring the boxing commission over to
 
02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
oplc this
 
02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:42.790 align:start position:0%
oplc this
session

02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
what's that and horse racing
 
02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have that yet so i'm sure
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
that'll come up soon um
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to um
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
to provide some observations and to the
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
division because there are some pending
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that i think could
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
impact this bill if it were to be passed
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
the first would be there's a recent
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
and in the bill it
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
would recognize that licensure
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
can have an impact on workforce and that
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
would establish a study committee to
 
02:04:16.719 --> 02:04:17.830 align:start position:0%
would establish a study committee to
determine

02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
determine
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
how we license and certify individuals
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
in this state obviously that would take
 
02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
some time but presumably any findings
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
that come out of that study could impact
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to go forward so i
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to let the division know about
 
02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
that one
 
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
and there's also
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding and amendment that
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
may go forward to senate bill 313
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
specific to funding
 
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
there have been a lot of discussions
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
among stakeholders about the appropriate
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
way to fund the office
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
who should determine fees how fees
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
should be allocated
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
the office has currently has statutory
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
authority over
 
02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
most of professions in terms of setting
 
02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:03.270 align:start position:0%
most of professions in terms of setting
fees

02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
but we know being on jail card that the
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
boards have retained some of that
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
authority so
 
02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:09.189 align:start position:0%
authority so
this

02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to senate bill 313 would
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
establish a study committee
 
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
what came out out of conversations
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
to senate bill 313 as introduced was
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
that there are disputes among
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders as to what the mechanism
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
for funding the agency should be
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
there are challenges
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
require that the licensee
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
that the agency be completely
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
self-supporting and if the cost
 
02:05:41.109 --> 02:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
allocation is based on
 
02:05:41.119 --> 02:05:42.470 align:start position:0%
allocation is based on
um

02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
consistent licensure fee that there are
 
02:05:50.550 --> 02:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
certain individuals who may not be able
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
um their fair share so to speak so
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
this committee would look at that there
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
have been suggestions that maybe we move
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
away from self-funding the agency i
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
don't think that would go very far
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's my personal opinion but that
 
02:06:08.069 --> 02:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
obviously um that report could impact i
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
think what would happen with this board
 
02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:11.669 align:start position:0%
think what would happen with this board
as

02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
it relates to funding you i think saw
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
we assumed that this would be a
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
completely self-funded board like the
 
02:06:21.510 --> 02:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
other boards
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
the average
 
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
cost of shared services
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
for a license and oplc is 155 dollars
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
for two years so that would be what we
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
would propose
 
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
that the certification fee should be
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
we don't know how many individuals are
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
actually licensed
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
we also don't know how much support
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
would be required
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
we classify all of our boards based on
 
02:06:45.679 --> 02:06:47.669 align:start position:0%
we classify all of our boards based on
identifiers

02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
identifiers
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
that we worked with the division of
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
personnel on into a b and c boards
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
depending on how much support they need
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
my assumption is that they would fall in
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
the middle like the real estate
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
appraiser so they would have a dedicated
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
board administrator um and maybe a
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
licensed clerk but until
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
until we um start working with the board
 
02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
to determine the complexity it's it's
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
not clear how much would be needed in
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
terms of staff support but any event i'd
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
that you may have i appreciate the
 
02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:18.629 align:start position:0%
that you may have i appreciate the
opportunity

02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
having served as a selectmen in a fairly
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
small town
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
we were the board of assessors who would
 
02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:34.629 align:start position:0%
we were the board of assessors who would
this

02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill affect would it affect
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
professionals only outside people who
 
02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:41.189 align:start position:0%
professionals only outside people who
who

02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
charge for their service
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
or would it affect
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
staff or in a city and down level
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to defer to the department
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
dre on that because i'm not intimately
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
familiar yet with the assessors
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding it would be just
 
02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representation
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman uh thanks for
 
02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:15.510 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman uh thanks for
appearing

02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
appearing
 
02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:16.550 align:start position:0%
appearing
uh

02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
i didn't see in here that this may go
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
back some time but there's a portion or
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
a couple of areas i'm like for instance
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
on page six line five as far as the
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
assessing of fines and violations
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
is there an appeals process for that
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
because i didn't happen to see it but i
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
may have overlooked it but i was just
 
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
curious if you
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
assess a two thousand dollar fine is
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
that appealable to somebody yeah so that
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
would be considered disciplinary so one
 
02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
is entitled to due process a notice and
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to be heard most
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
we did seek a legislative change last
 
02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
we did seek a legislative change last
year

02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
that did get passed
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
so all appeals
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
go to the supreme court
 
02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.790 align:start position:0%
go to the supreme court
and

02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
some of the board i think one board had
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to go to superior court and
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
then go to supreme court it didn't make
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
sense to us that you you would have to
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
go through a couple of different steps
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
um i will say though that that's you
 
02:09:15.599 --> 02:09:17.109 align:start position:0%
um i will say though that that's you
know

02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
from a policy
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
standpoint that's that can be concerning
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
because who's going to spend twenty
 
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars on an appeal to appeal
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollar fine so you know the
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
state may want to look at that when um
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
when you know if there were to be a
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
study committee on occupational
 
02:09:31.679 --> 02:09:33.030 align:start position:0%
study committee on occupational
licensing

02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
because i can tell you that it's usually
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
only physicians you know a handful of
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know maybe dentists who actually
 
02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:39.910 align:start position:0%
you know maybe dentists who actually
appeal

02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
um decisions of a licensing board
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
a follow-up if i could mr chairman
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at assessment and as
 
02:09:50.229 --> 02:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
representative griffin pointed out
 
02:09:50.239 --> 02:09:51.189 align:start position:0%
representative griffin pointed out
um

02:09:51.189 --> 02:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
bringing the dra into the picture now
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
the dra has a procedure for appealing
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
assessments and then they have an
 
02:09:59.669 --> 02:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
internal body and that can go to the
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
board of tax and land appeal so i guess
 
02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
what i'm hoping is that somewhere down
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
the line you do something internally so
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't have to go to superior
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
court and then the final question if i
 
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
could mr chairman
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
so it says that you have all these
 
02:10:14.639 --> 02:10:15.910 align:start position:0%
so it says that you have all these
powers

02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
powers
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh for instance um
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
to administer ults and affirm uh
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
affirmations uh
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
subpoenas witnesses compel
 
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
people by subpoenas
 
02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:29.189 align:start position:0%
people by subpoenas
what

02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh is there statutorily something that
 
02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:33.910 align:start position:0%
uh is there statutorily something that
um

02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
what am i looking for like your
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
credentials for hiring at this job do
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
you have to be an attorney or
 
02:10:42.629 --> 02:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
hold it justice of the peace or
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
because you've got pretty broad powers
 
02:10:44.639 --> 02:10:45.750 align:start position:0%
because you've got pretty broad powers
um

02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's not required so i'm appointed by
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
the governor and approved my counsel i
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
am both a jp and an attorney
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
um but i will say this statute i think
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
is crafted off of first of all i don't
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
take a position on whether i should have
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
this powers or i didn't craft this
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
statute but i think it's based on the
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
real estate appraisers um
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
and i will say it's very common for
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
state statutes to delegate authority to
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
a commissioner or an agency head it's
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
not actually that person who
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
historically carries out all functions
 
02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
if you look at you know commissioner of
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
hhs for example if you look at the ddj
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
statute that there's a lot of
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
requirements that the commissioner do x
 
02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
y and z
 
02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's usually delegated either via rule
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
rule and policy and procedure after
 
02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
internal controls are established so
 
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
so this would typically be done pursuant
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
to as a particular rule and procedure
 
02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay i just had never seen that mr
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
chairman it kind of caught my eye that
 
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
the not you know putting you on the spot
 
02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
but the position has those
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
immense powers right
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
another oh yes representative goalie
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and sitting on edna
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
we deal with all the licensing
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
certification and
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
registration bills um
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
and this did come to the committee 18 to
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
zero with these recommendations because
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
of what we heard from
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
revenue administration and transferring
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
these folks over only made sense to put
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
them in their own board in a separate
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
statute under oplc
 
02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:33.430 --> 02:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
good one

02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
my name is
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
sorry my name is carolyn lear l-e-a-r
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i am the assistant commissioner at
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue
 
02:12:44.719 --> 02:12:46.709 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue
um

02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
so i would say um from the department
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't take a position
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill and i would say from the
 
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
department's perspective there actually
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
isn't an issue
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
to be solved here
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
um this was a bill i believe
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
that was requested by the assessing
 
02:13:02.079 --> 02:13:03.750 align:start position:0%
that was requested by the assessing
community

02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
based on a recommendation from the
 
02:13:09.069 --> 02:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
assessing standards board which is an
 
02:13:11.669 --> 02:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
administratively attached board to the
 
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
department but is not
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
the department
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
so the commissioner has one seat of i
 
02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:17.990 align:start position:0%
so the commissioner has one seat of i
think

02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
12 seats on that board but it's
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
primarily made up of either
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
professional assessors or local
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
assessing officials
 
02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:28.790 align:start position:0%
assessing officials
the

02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
rule framework for assessor
 
02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
certification is also
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
from that board and the department
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
really just administers those rules as
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
it relates to the certification process
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
for assessors
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
which we are happy to continue doing i
 
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
wish there were assessors here today to
 
02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
tell you why they thought it was um
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
necessary to transition the board from
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue to oplc
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
to summarize what i understand their
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
concerns to be
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
without you know speaking for them
 
02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:02.709 align:start position:0%
without you know speaking for them
formally

02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
formally
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue has a pretty
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
ironclad confidentiality statute
 
02:14:10.229 --> 02:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
that makes
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
most of what we do at the department
 
02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:13.750 align:start position:0%
most of what we do at the department
confidential

02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that the
 
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
assessors are dissatisfied that
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
the certification and specifically the
 
02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
assessor discipline process
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
when complaints are brought against
 
02:14:28.350 --> 02:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
assessors falls within that
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
confidentiality umbrella
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
and they propose to fix that with this
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
transition of the certification function
 
02:14:39.669 --> 02:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
from the department of revenue to oplc
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
that being said there is another bill
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
making its way through the process
 
02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill 53
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
holdover from last session which should
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
be crossing over to you that takes a
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
more direct route and makes assessor
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
certification records public so rather
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
than transition the board entirely to
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
oplc it would simply make um
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
those records public and available for
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
the public to see much like a real
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
estate license
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
you can go online and see if somebody
 
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
has a real estate yep
 
02:15:14.159 --> 02:15:15.510 align:start position:0%
has a real estate yep
okay

02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
so this
 
02:15:18.550 --> 02:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
i'm starting to understand
 
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is basically move
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
the assessor's functionality supervision
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
whatever over to oplc from
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
so we're really not changing anything
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
we're just
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
moving it over
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
there are some substantive changes to
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
the makeup of the certification board
 
02:15:43.350 --> 02:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
as i had mentioned
 
02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
the assessing standards board which sets
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
the rules for assessor certification has
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
about a dozen members
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
intended to represent both large towns
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
and small towns
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well as taxpayers
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has a seat on that
 
02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
board as well as several legislators the
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
makeup of this board before oplc is much
 
02:16:07.679 --> 02:16:09.430 align:start position:0%
makeup of this board before oplc is much
smaller

02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore represents fewer of those
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:21.589 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
it was cut and dry before but now it
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
gets confusing yes
 
02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative griffin go ahead nope
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
i'll speak to it after okay go ahead
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative lishman
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman so i appreciate you
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
saying that you're not taking a position
 
02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:38.469 align:start position:0%
saying that you're not taking a position
but

02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
reading that between the lines it kind
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
of sounds like
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
isn't entirely happy with this
 
02:16:47.439 --> 02:16:49.750 align:start position:0%
isn't entirely happy with this
legislation

02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that no i would i would
 
02:16:51.679 --> 02:16:52.629 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that no i would i would
say

02:16:52.629 --> 02:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:16:54.549 --> 02:16:54.559 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
make up a huge proportion of the tax
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
burden in the state of new hampshire
 
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.150 align:start position:0%
burden in the state of new hampshire
and

02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
the assessors the certified assessors
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
that value
 
02:17:08.639 --> 02:17:09.910 align:start position:0%
that value
property

02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
have a hugely important role in ensuring
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
the fairness of that process
 
02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't say that we're opposed to
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
to moving them to a different agency but
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
i think it should be a very carefully
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
thought out decision to do so
 
02:17:28.309 --> 02:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
so that those interests continue to be
 
02:17:28.319 --> 02:17:30.150 align:start position:0%
so that those interests continue to be
protected

02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
protected
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
you know if i could um mr chairman
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
so i've sat here a long time and seen a
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
number of dre commissioners and it's
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
always been the greatest respect and
 
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
you folks do a good job and like i
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there's an appeals
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
process within the
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
agency within a certain bureau and they
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
work well with taxpayers so i guess
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
gut feeling is
 
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
i think the dre has done a good job
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
overseeing assessing in the state and
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
appraisals we recently had a problem in
 
02:18:01.509 --> 02:18:01.519 align:start position:0%
peterborough and the department sent
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
people down to talk with taxpayers so
 
02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little concerned of
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
tearing that oversight away if you will
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
and giving it to the oplc that's my
 
02:18:11.679 --> 02:18:18.950 align:start position:0%
and giving it to the oplc that's my
concern

02:18:18.950 --> 02:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
i have that thought as well and i'm
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
pretty familiar with the oplc
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
being on dell car for many years and
 
02:18:30.389 --> 02:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
adjudicating their rules and i'm very
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the current
 
02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
structure of the oplc but then again
 
02:18:37.349 --> 02:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
going to my concern i don't know if the
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
exists within the oplc
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
to adjudicate some of these
 
02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:46.910 align:start position:0%
concerns with
 
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:48.150 align:start position:0%
concerns with
[Music]

02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
assessment values
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
like the dra currently does i mean the
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
oplc handles physicians i mean they
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
handle a myriad of very important
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
functions they handle a wide range of
 
02:19:03.349 --> 02:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
subjects and do a very good job at it
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
within the boards they oversee what we
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
need to understand is the oplc all they
 
02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
do do
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
are supposed to do it's a consolidation
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
of different boards and handle the
 
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
administrative functions of a myriad of
 
02:19:16.479 --> 02:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
administrative functions of a myriad of
boards

02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
boards
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if within the oplc
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
that they have the wherewithal
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
uninterested party to adjudicate some
 
02:19:27.519 --> 02:19:28.549 align:start position:0%
uninterested party to adjudicate some
assessment

02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
assessment concerns
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
like we currently have in the dra and
 
02:19:36.070 --> 02:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
understand enough what the lplc would
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
incorporate from the dra to have that
 
02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:42.709 align:start position:0%
incorporate from the dra to have that
same

02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
adjudicative body with the expertise
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
that the dra has
 
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
currently so i
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
i would have to get a lot more
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
information before i would even but i'm
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
not a policy guy i just do finance but
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
this representative this is concerned
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
once again
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
i like to think that the edna committee
 
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
when we look at these bills and these
 
02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
boards and certifications do our
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding is in doing this the
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
oplc will be just reviewing the criteria
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
for the licensing and registration of
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
it will still maintain dras ability to
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
deal with the assessing standards and
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
the assessments that go on and anything
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
that needs to be adjudicated in that
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
sense the board is not oplc is not
 
02:20:33.670 --> 02:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
taking over that aspect they are just
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
taking over
 
02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:38.790 align:start position:0%
taking over
the

02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
licensing procedures and maintaining
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
those license licensees and taking the
 
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
board under their scope of
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
practice versus dra dra still maintains
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
all the assessing and any discrepancies
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
that go on still goes through them and
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
not through oplc
 
02:20:59.110 --> 02:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
and if i'm wrong please correct me
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm coming at this from a very different
 
02:21:08.469 --> 02:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
perspective than everyone else i guess
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
i look at
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
both the dra and the and the licensing
 
02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:15.030 align:start position:0%
both the dra and the and the licensing
board

02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
as being part of the executive
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
department of the state
 
02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:19.910 align:start position:0%
department of the state
and

02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
as such
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if there's a need
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
to make a change it should be coming
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
from the governor and his staff
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
instead of from from us as legislators
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
but over and above that i was very
 
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
pleased to hear
 
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
that the senate bill
 
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
there is a senate bill
 
02:21:44.469 --> 02:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
that is addressing the major issue here
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
which seems to be
 
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
pushing the bill
 
02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:48.630 align:start position:0%
pushing the bill
forward

02:21:48.630 --> 02:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:55.830 --> 02:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
i hate to see the assessors
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
pushed over in the licensing board
 
02:21:57.920 --> 02:21:59.510 align:start position:0%
pushed over in the licensing board
inevitably

02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
inevitably
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
it will raise the cost of hiring
 
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:03.670 align:start position:0%
it will raise the cost of hiring
assessor

02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
assessor
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
and it just grows a bureaucracy
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
and it's part of the executive
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
department and if the governor
 
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
and his managers feel like
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
they need this bill
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that should be
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
be pushing it and sponsoring it and i
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't see that happening
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
so i plan to vote against
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'll second representative griffin's
 
02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:47.990 align:start position:0%
i'll second representative griffin's
motion

02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay do you have a second oh you
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
we're not a couple things here and
 
02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:10.469 align:start position:0%
we're not a couple things here and
that's

02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
part of why i went on my tirade that i
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
did is we're not a policy committee and
 
02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
we're voting this down
 
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
based on the lack of policy now
 
02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
understand that the oplc
 
02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:23.670 align:start position:0%
understand that the oplc
and

02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's my point has taken over
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
a myriad of very important licenses for
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
individuals to assure their their they
 
02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
fall within the compliance of whatever
 
02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:36.389 align:start position:0%
fall within the compliance of whatever
board

02:23:36.389 --> 02:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
that exists within their auspices
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
and we're really not changing the way
 
02:23:44.550 --> 02:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
the earth rotates here all right
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
all we're changing is ensuring that the
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
licensure of assessing
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
individuals that are tasked
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
given that task
 
02:23:54.640 --> 02:23:55.510 align:start position:0%
given that task
meet

02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
meet
 
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
within a certain
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
standard as decided by their board we're
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
not changing the way the earth rotates
 
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is changing how it
 
02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
the administration of that and and
 
02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
probably if
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
the same thing com
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
follows as it did with a myriad of other
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
licenses we have in this state
 
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
it will only improve that process
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
and make it a little better and that's
 
02:24:25.510 --> 02:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
what has that's what's currently
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
happening so
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not at all opposed to this
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i trust the policy committee
 
02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
did their due diligence in an area that
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not that familiar with so i i
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
would i would not vote for uh itl on
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
this based on that and this came out of
 
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
the policy committee 18-0 right yes
 
02:24:46.469 --> 02:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative goalie thank you mr
 
02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
chairman if i may and being on that
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
policy committee it did come out 18 to
 
02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
nothing and was passed on consent
 
02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
for this policy
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
one of the other main reasons which you
 
02:24:58.870 --> 02:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
heard earlier
 
02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:00.309 align:start position:0%
heard earlier
which

02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
we can talk about a senate bill but we
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
do not have it in our possession correct
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
if we don't do anything we still are
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
going to have that 91a issue that was
 
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier this was one of
 
02:25:12.469 --> 02:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
those ways to address that issue that
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
was brought before the policy committee
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
the policy committee reviewed all its
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
options this bill was amended as you can
 
02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
see with an amendment to make it better
 
02:25:21.439 --> 02:25:23.190 align:start position:0%
see with an amendment to make it better
and

02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that were brought
 
02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:25.670 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that were brought
forward

02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore went to the house floor as
 
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
a unanimous recommendation
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
so i i can't support itl
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
after that being said and those votes
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.309 --> 02:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
their main
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
focus is dealing with licensure and
 
02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:47.910 align:start position:0%
focus is dealing with licensure and
that

02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
representation so sticking to this the
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
financial aspects of this we're creating
 
02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
an assessing certification board
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
we're establishing
 
02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
fines which there is no appeals process
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know looking at the fiscal note i
 
02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
think there are about 200 individuals
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
that will be assessed
 
02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
a fee of 155 dollars so i'm just
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's some there's some costs whereas
 
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
creating a board of i don't know how
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
many different professionals that will
 
02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:18.309 align:start position:0%
many different professionals that will
obviously

02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
receive some sort of
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
pay actual travel by new board members
 
02:26:23.439 --> 02:26:26.070 align:start position:0%
pay actual travel by new board members
um

02:26:26.070 --> 02:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
so i guess i stand by my second
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
even though the there are some financial
 
02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
implications and the thing that
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
bothers me about assessing fees and
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
fines is a process where you don't
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
give someone
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
an easy way out to appeal and force them
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
to go to superior court and that costs
 
02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:47.030 align:start position:0%
to go to superior court and that costs
money

02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative griffin
 
02:26:50.469 --> 02:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
just to uh
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
to add to uh representative leachman's
 
02:26:57.270 --> 02:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
usually when people get in the
 
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
professionals get into the licensing
 
02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:02.389 align:start position:0%
professionals get into the licensing
board

02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:27:05.110 --> 02:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
the requirements for continuing
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
professional education
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
get enacted and they tend to grow over a
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
and the costs of those
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
doubled really
 
02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
the assessor would have if he's required
 
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
for continuing
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
professional education he'd have the
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
cost of the education itself
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
plus he'd have the
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
week or two weeks
 
02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
in some cases that he'd lose
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
to do his job basically so there is a
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
cost to it it's uh
 
02:27:42.309 --> 02:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a disease that our uh
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
society suffers from
 
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
the more we legislate the more we put
 
02:27:53.270 --> 02:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
into law
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
the higher the cost of everything
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i would state
 
02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:11.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i would state
that

02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
from dra that there is a cost for these
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
folks currently who are registered and
 
02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:18.870 align:start position:0%
folks currently who are registered and
licensed

02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
without this board being in place that
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's there is a cost for their
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
certification currently and that if they
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
do no wrong that there's no recourse and
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
no fines or
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
violations for these individuals
 
02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:35.030 align:start position:0%
violations for these individuals
yes

02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
so there currently is no fee for the
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
certification license before the dra
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
so that would be an increased cost
 
02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:44.550 align:start position:0%
so that would be an increased cost
difference

02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:28:47.429 --> 02:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
i tried to quickly look at our rule the
 
02:28:49.750 --> 02:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
assessing standard board's rules because
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
those rules do set forth the types of
 
02:28:54.790 --> 02:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
discipline that can result
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we can issue fines but i
 
02:29:00.389 --> 02:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't quickly get them on my phone my
 
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
experience has been
 
02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
within at the department for the past
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
just under a decade we have never issued
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
a fine
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
the types of discipline that we issue
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
when there's a
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
determination that there has been
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
some sort of assessor wrongdoing is
 
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
typically a period of downgraded
 
02:29:20.479 --> 02:29:22.630 align:start position:0%
typically a period of downgraded
certification

02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
certification
 
02:29:25.270 --> 02:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
license suspension for a period of time
 
02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:27.670 align:start position:0%
license suspension for a period of time
or

02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
education requirements taking classes to
 
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
sort of remediate the misunderstanding
 
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
that led to the error
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if it's that we just have
 
02:29:37.750 --> 02:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
never issued a fine or if we don't
 
02:29:39.270 --> 02:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
actually have the ability i couldn't
 
02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:40.230 align:start position:0%
actually have the ability i couldn't
quickly

02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative okay thank you
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
given the recent problems we had in
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
berlin with our assessing board no no i
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make a comment um i'm not
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
in favor of itl in this this bill
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
as a result the dra we disbanded our
 
02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:03.750 align:start position:0%
as a result the dra we disbanded our
assessors

02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
assessors
 
02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
which are important by the judge and the
 
02:30:07.349 --> 02:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
city council as a result the city
 
02:30:09.270 --> 02:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
council now acts as the board of
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
assisters i think this bill is
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
definitely needed to proceed with doing
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
some type of
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
correction to make sure that they're
 
02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
qualified so i will be voting against
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
my difficulty with with itl is is a
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
i have to i have to say that they know a
 
02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
lot more about this than
 
02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
than i do certainly
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
so i would i would have to not support
 
02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:46.070 align:start position:0%
so i would i would have to not support
itl

02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
so with that said there's a motion made
 
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
and seconded
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%

with that said
 
02:31:53.840 --> 02:31:54.790 align:start position:0%
with that said
uh

uh
 
02:31:57.670 --> 02:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
hb 1522 will

go as otp
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%

02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:02.309 align:start position:0%
and that concludes
this

02:32:02.309 --> 02:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
