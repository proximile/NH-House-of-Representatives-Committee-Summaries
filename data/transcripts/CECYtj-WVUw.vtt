excuse me
 
00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.729 align:start position:0%
excuse me
yeah

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
the budget that we are proposing is
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
straightforward it follows the
 
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
guidelines sent forth by the governor
 
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 align:start position:0%
it does include uh five new positions
 
00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
um two of them are related to
 
00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 align:start position:0%
information technology and three are
 
00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.449 align:start position:0%
information technology and three are
clerical

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
um you know really no other initiatives
 
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
that are new in the budget we we do have
 
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
an election presidential primary coming
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
up in FY 20.
 
00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.750 align:start position:0%
up in FY 20.
for

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.330 align:start position:0%
for
eign

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 align:start position:0%
eign
 
00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
that that election is typically funded
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
uh in a budget footnote and I understand
 
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
those are going to be addressed later
 
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
but we want to make sure that we have
 
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
the funds available to conduct that
 
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.770 align:start position:0%
the funds available to conduct that
election

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
um I really don't have anything to add
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
to that other than to answer any
 
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 align:start position:0%
uh over the last month now or close to a
 
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
month we the state has undergone a
 
00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 align:start position:0%
number of well-publicized recounts uh
 
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
how are those accounted for in the
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
budget and maybe I could say like how
 
00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
expensive is a typical recount to your
 
00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
office and then how is that accounted
 
00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 align:start position:0%
for in the budget when when you have uh
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
recounts that maybe you're above and
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
beyond your expectations
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh the recounts are paid for out of the
 
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 align:start position:0%
elections portion of our budget
 
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
excuse me the candidates that request a
 
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.150 align:start position:0%
excuse me the candidates that request a
recount

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
recount
 
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
pay a fee
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
based on how close the race was if it
 
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
was a very close race
 
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
the fee is nominal and the state
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
basically picks up the cost
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
if and then depending on the percentage
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
if the difference between winning and
 
00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
losing is more than three percent then
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
the candidate has to agree to pay for
 
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
the cost of the recap
 
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
that cost involves picking up the
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
ballots from the various municipalities
 
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.670 align:start position:0%
ballots from the various municipalities
um

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
for the district that is being recounted
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 align:start position:0%
and then hiring the teams uh the
 
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
counting teams necessary to conduct a
 
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
recount and we have a pool of
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
probably 30.
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
counters that we use through the course
 
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 align:start position:0%
of the election
 
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
this year has has been a record and we
 
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
still we're still in the final recount
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
so we're close to a month after the
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
election and we're still recounting
 
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
ballots so the cost of three counts is
 
00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
this year I believe you have a total of
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
80 funded positions
 
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
and as much a good chocolate of those 80
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
positions how many are currently staffed
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
or which in other words what what's your
 
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
yeah let's see
 
00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
we have roughly seven vacant positions
 
00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 align:start position:0%
um four of those are
 
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh you know we have been trying to fill
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
those uh and we're having the same
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
struggles uh like every other agency in
 
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to find people to apply
 
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
for the positions and take the job okay
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
and in the new positions what it what
 
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
what's the basis for those what are
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
their what's their job responsibility is
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me the secretary of state is one
 
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
of the few agencies that has an
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
independent information technology
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
division uh we have that because of the
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
importance of making sure that our
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
elections primarily are independent from
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
any other agency in it
 
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
we control those databases
 
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
um and so we own the responsibility for
 
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.129 align:start position:0%
um and so we own the responsibility for
that

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:04.790 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
the positions that we are trying to fill
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
are our top leadership positions
 
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.570 align:start position:0%
are our top leadership positions
um

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:17.780 align:start position:0%
their their management
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
and database related
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:24.350 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
I think that answers my questions thank
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:30.539 align:start position:0%
um you had mentioned that normally
 
00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
there's a budget but no
 
00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:32.990 align:start position:0%

thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
but uh you're still on the dock uh we're
 
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
going to switch you now to the right to
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
know Ombudsman obviously it's a new
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
position which I don't believe has been
 
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
filled yet uh in a new office but
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
um not take your testimony on that
 
00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead yep
 
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
sure so just for background if you're
 
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
not aware this was a legislative
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
um position that was created in the last
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
term and it was attached to the
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office my
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the governor and
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
Council and the governor have not
 
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.310 align:start position:0%

today he's away
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
um their budget is strictly an
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget from this current
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
budget year their expenses are really
 
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
mostly only per diems for the board
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
members to attend the events mileage for
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
that and a small stipend for them to
 
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
attend the yearly meeting of the
 
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
and their budgets are around roughly
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollars in each in each
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
for the first time in three days I don't
 
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's good because I don't know much
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.090 align:start position:0%
 
hey

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
now I like to invite the judicial
 
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.490 align:start position:0%
now I like to invite the judicial
Council

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
Council
 
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
good morning is this I'm sorry is this
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
on that is on that the red light's on
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's you're good that makes sense
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
um good morning I'm Sarah Blodgett
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
executive director of the judicial
 
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:06.620 align:start position:0%
Council and I am here with Richard
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
samparrell who I anticipate will shortly
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
be appointed as the acting executive
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
director of the judicial Council my last
 
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
official day with the council is
 
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and that has nothing to do with
 
00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
the budget process it just worked out
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
um but I wanted to um make sure that you
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
all had a chance to meet Richard face to
 
00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:30.230 align:start position:0%
all had a chance to meet Richard face to
face

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
face
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I expect that he will be uh
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
nominated in the next couple of days I'm
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
um so we are in front of you today with
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
the most significant increase in the
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
history of the judicial Council and this
 
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
is necessary to address the ongoing
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
Indigent defense crisis
 
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:55.940 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of our additional
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
prioritized need which is a little over
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
14.5 million dollars is to fund
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
court-appointed representation
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
we are grateful for governor sununu and
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
the legislature's support of indigent
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
defense needs during this biennium
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
we have had a lot of help from allies
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
across the state as we deal with what is
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
really an unprecedented issue facing our
 
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.410 align:start position:0%
really an unprecedented issue facing our
system

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
as you know the council is charged with
 
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
overseeing the quality and the cost
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of indigent defense and
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
those are duties that are taken very
 
00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
seriously by the councils and its
 
00:14:38.459 --> 00:14:39.650 align:start position:0%
seriously by the councils and its
members

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
that is reflected I think in our past
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
budget requests this is not an agency
 
00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
that routinely asks for significant
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
increases in its appropriation
 
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.850 align:start position:0%
increases in its appropriation
um

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
but we are here to do that now
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
we are at a Crossroads for Indigent
 
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.050 align:start position:0%
we are at a Crossroads for Indigent
defense

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
defense
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear that funding alone
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
will not solve these issues but without
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
it I do not see a path forward for our
 
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
the state's funding for Indigent defense
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
fulfills the Constitutional requirement
 
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
to provide criminal representation to
 
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:19.019 align:start position:0%
those who cannot afford it
 
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
the public defender is the backbone of
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
our Indigent defense program and our
 
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized need requests for
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
this program is
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
I want to give you a little bit of
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
history about the public defender uh in
 
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
a typical year this program handles 85
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
percent of the Indigent defense caseload
 
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
we have a group of private attorneys who
 
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:50.339 align:start position:0%
have contracts with the judicial Council
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
to take a certain number of cases for a
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
flat fee and those lawyers routinely
 
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
accept 14 of the caseload we also have a
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
pool of private attorneys who take cases
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
they are reimbursed on an hourly basis
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
and they in the past have accounted for
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
one percent of the Indigent defense
 
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.269 align:start position:0%
one percent of the Indigent defense
caseload

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
and those numbers are are really
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
critical to the success of the Indigent
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
defense program
 
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 22 for a variety of reasons
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
the public defender was only able to
 
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
handle 80 percent of the caseload now
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
that's only a decrease of five percent
 
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
but it almost broke the Indigent defense
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
program that we have here
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
um High staff turnover and case backlogs
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
created a perfect storm for the public
 
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
defender program
 
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
fewer cases resolved during the pandemic
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
leading to overwhelming caseloads many
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers were carrying more than 100
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
cases and I would like to just point
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
your attention to page one of our
 
00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:02.990 align:start position:0%
your attention to page one of our
handout

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
handout
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
hopefully you got a beautiful color copy
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and I think that this really
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
illustrates where we are right now in
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
the knowledge base at the public
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
defender we still have a lot of
 
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
experienced qualified lawyers on that
 
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.870 align:start position:0%
experienced qualified lawyers on that
program

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
but since the pandemic started you can
 
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
see that we lost a little less than 50
 
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
and you can see in the second column the
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
combined years of experience that those
 
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
attorneys represent that's 443 years of
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
experience with the public defender
 
00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:45.350 align:start position:0%
experience with the public defender
program

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
the program during that same period of
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
time has been able to recruit and hire
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
55 lawyers the vast majority of those
 
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
lawyers came in with no experience and
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
so you can see in that final column what
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
the combined experience gained from
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
those hires has been and I think that
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
that really
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
really highlights our current struggle
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
I think it's fairly obvious that new
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
lawyers are new members of any
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
profession are just not as efficient
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
they don't understand the system as well
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
there's a very steep learning curve for
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
new public defenders and the public
 
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
defender invests significantly in
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
training of new lawyers but it is going
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
to take a at least a few years for these
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
brand new lawyers to be up and running
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
at the level of some of the folks who
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
this shift in experience is coincided
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
with increasingly complex cases
 
00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:53.810 align:start position:0%
with increasingly complex cases
um

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
and the second page of our handout is
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
an illustration of the data requirements
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
for Discovery and you can see we're
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
showing you per office breakdown
 
00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:10.220 align:start position:0%
and since 2018
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
the size terabyte size of Discovery
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
coming into the public defender has
 
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically and not only does
 
00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
that mean costs for I.T and support for
 
00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:27.419 align:start position:0%
it but it means that these cases take
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
much longer to resolve we have attorneys
 
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
who now have to look at dash cam video
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
footage and you know everybody it seems
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
as if everybody has a ring camera up and
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
so there's so much more evidence
 
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
potential exculpatory evidence that has
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
to be combed through and so a case that
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
might have taken 12 hours to resolve
 
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
five years ago could now take upwards of
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
40 hours just because of the amount of
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
evidence that needs to be reviewed by
 
00:19:57.299 --> 00:20:00.830 align:start position:0%
evidence that needs to be reviewed by
Council

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
so there there's been a seismic shift in
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
the experience level of the staff
 
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.950 align:start position:0%
the experience level of the staff
attorneys

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
clients are presenting with more
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
challenging issues I think it has become
 
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
increasingly clear that during the
 
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
pandemic many New Hampshire residents
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
were not getting mental health substance
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
use treatment and so the clients are
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
presenting a much more challenging
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
fashion than they had prior to the
 
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.850 align:start position:0%
fashion than they had prior to the
pandemic

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
cases are also taking longer to resolve
 
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
and for the first time in its history
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
the public defender has been forced to
 
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
put clients on a hold list
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
the most recent count has 960 916 cases
 
00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:47.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
there has been a recent change in
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
leadership at the public defender Sarah
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
Rothman who was the managing attorney of
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
the Manchester office one of the busiest
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
offices or probably the busiest office
 
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
in the state has taken over is the
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
she is focused on Recruitment and
 
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
Retention and our additional prioritized
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
need reflects these priorities
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
this appropriation would allow us to
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
continue the 10 increase that was
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
implemented on a temporary basis in
 
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
April of this year that was an across
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
the board increase in the salaries for
 
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
all staff
 
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
it would also allow the public defender
 
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
to fund additional steps at the top of
 
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
the scale so the original salary scale
 
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
ended at a step 11. this would allow the
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
public defender to fund steps 12 through
 
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
15 in an effort to keep the experienced
 
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
it would also fund an additional five
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
percent increase during the next
 
00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:52.610 align:start position:0%
percent increase during the next
biennium

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
and in looking at advertisements for
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
public defender positions in neighboring
 
00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.230 align:start position:0%
public defender positions in neighboring
states

00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
advertisements for positions with
 
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
prosecutor offices these salary
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
increases are really necessary to remain
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
competitive and to keep the folks that
 
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:12.020 align:start position:0%
we have now on board
 
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
it would also fund the creation of eight
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
new I.T paralegal positions which are
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
really critical especially in light of
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
this high volume Discovery cases and the
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
electronic discovery that is now common
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
and it would also be used to assist to
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
this additional prioritized need is the
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
number one priority for the judicial
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
Council we've had a glimpse over the
 
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
past couple of years of what will happen
 
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:46.580 align:start position:0%
if the public defender is not able to
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
keep 85 percent of its caselope 85
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
percent of the Indigent defense caseload
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
and our system is not built to address
 
00:22:54.419 --> 00:23:03.049 align:start position:0%
and our system is not built to address
that

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.649 --> 00:23:05.659 align:start position:0%
Council has
 
00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419 align:start position:0%
struggled quite a bit over the past year
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
and a half with a point of counsel
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
outside of the public defender program
 
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.750 align:start position:0%
outside of the public defender program
and

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
we are also in the I'm sorry the request
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
for the public defender is on page 14 of
 
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
um and that request also includes four
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars for a secondary public
 
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
defender program
 
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
the council has had statutory authority
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
to create another program since the
 
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
1980s this is never had to seriously
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
contemplate this before
 
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
but right now we need another program
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
that will accept every case that is
 
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
offered to it absent a conflict or case
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
load caps
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
current Indigent defense system is not
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
meeting the need attorneys are
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed and they do not want to
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
accept incarcerated clients juvenile
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
clients or parole cases
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
today as I said here 14 defendants are
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
in jail awaiting appointment of counsel
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
we have three juveniles with upcoming
 
00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:19.700 align:start position:0%
court dates but no attorney
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
so we are requesting four million
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
dollars to create another public
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
defender program that would be
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
it would be taking conflict cases
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
it could also help if there's still a
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
hold list at the time that it gets up
 
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
and running but the real need is to
 
00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
ensure quick appointment of counsel
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
under the current program we are
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
reaching out to 25 attorneys to find
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
somebody who is willing to accept an
 
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
incarcerated client these delays are
 
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
increasing and we need to change the
 
00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
uh the RFP will go out in the spring
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
obviously contingent on appropriate
 
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
funding through the budget
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
four million dollars is the best
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
estimate that we have for the cost of
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
setting up a firm from scratch but it's
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
certainly possible that an already
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
existing private firm will will put in a
 
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
proposal for this but we are looking to
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
focus on Merrimack in Hillsborough
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
County which have the most cases in the
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
state and we're the biggest unmet need
 
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
um the contract attorney budget is on
 
00:25:42.169 --> 00:25:42.179 align:start position:0%
page 13 of the budget book
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
we are requesting an additional
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
prioritized need of six hundred thousand
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
dollars for this program
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
the contract attorneys are also in
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
crisis we have lost nine attorneys since
 
00:25:59.330 --> 00:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
the beginning of fiscal 22 and that
 
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
equates to about 900 cases
 
00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:06.299 align:start position:0%
so our contract attorneys are at maximum
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
capacity right now
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
the fiscal 23 contract included some
 
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.029 align:start position:0%
the fiscal 23 contract included some
additional

00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursements to the contract attorneys
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
we are now providing an administrative
 
00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
fee to address overhead and we are
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
providing an additional two hundred
 
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
dollar fee for an incarcerated felony
 
00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
case an additional hundred dollar fee
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
for an incarcerated misdemeanor level
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
case and the additional prioritized need
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
of six hundred thousand dollars is to
 
00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:38.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
the assigned Council line is on page 11
 
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
of your of the budget book and this line
 
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
pays for the representation of indigent
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
defendants in criminal cases and accuse
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
parents in the child protection cases
 
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419 align:start position:0%
at the request of the judicial Council
 
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court increased the
 
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate for court appointed
 
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.169 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate for court appointed
representation

00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
the 60 an hour rate was set in 1992 and
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
it did not increase until October 1st of
 
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
this year when it went up to ninety
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement rate for serious
 
00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
felonies had been a hundred dollars an
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
hour and that rate it has increased to
 
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:23.900 align:start position:0%
125 dollars an hour
 
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
again as as we've seen that the public
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
defender had to curtail intake of new
 
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
cases the contract attorney program got
 
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
saturated the assigned Council who in
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
the past have only handled one percent
 
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
of this caseload that has increased to
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
six percent
 
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
and it is an increase of almost a
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
thousand more cases than in the previous
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal year every one of those cases is
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
assigned by calls emails and some cases
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
begging attorneys to take those
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
appointments and our materials include
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
some articles that discuss the the
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
crisis and the efforts that have been
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
made to address it as you know the
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court pulled together a task
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
force led by Justice Donovan they made a
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
request to private firms across the
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
state to take these cases we have
 
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
recruited attorneys from Massachusetts
 
00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:22.940 align:start position:0%
Vermont Maine
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
but we still do not have enough lawyers
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
willing to accept these cases and since
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
the increase I have heard from attorneys
 
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
in private practice that this will help
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
them make a case to their Partners to
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
the partners that they should be able to
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
take some of these cases but we're still
 
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
not reimbursing at a level that is
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
anywhere near equivalent to the private
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
the additional prioritized need here is
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh quite steep at 3.6 million dollars
 
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
that is to fund the increase and the
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
Services other than Council are on page
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
um the council only pays for services if
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
a judge has determined that it is
 
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
necessary for an adequate defense as
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
required by the Constitution
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
this line includes costs for expert
 
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
Witnesses transcripts and interpreters
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
we almost expended the entire fiscal 23
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
appropriation for services by the end of
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
this month
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh our additional prioritized need is
 
00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollars
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
this also reflects an anticipated
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
significant cost for experts in the YDC
 
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
cases I'm sure you've seen some of the
 
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
headlines about these cases but the
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
discovery is in excess of 20 million
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
Pages there are 11 co-defendants and it
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
is a case unlike anything we have ever
 
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
seen before in this state and it is
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
going to be the cost is going to be
 
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.149 align:start position:0%
going to be the cost is going to be
significant

00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
and now I know that our handouts and and
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
most of my presentation today are
 
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
focused on Indigent fence and that is a
 
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
topic that we have talked about quite a
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
lot over the past several months but the
 
00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
judicial Council also funds other
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
programs and we pay for the
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
private Guardians at Litem and the
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys appointed to represent parents
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
in the child protection world and the
 
00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
judicial Council also contracts with
 
00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:46.570 align:start position:0%
judicial Council also contracts with
Casa

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:46.580 align:start position:0%
Casa
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure most of you know Casa is the
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
preferred provider of guardian ad litem
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
services and child protection cases
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
their volunteer Advocates receive
 
00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
extensive training and supervision
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
the state's investment is a
 
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
public-private partnership and it funds
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
a relationship with abused or neglected
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
children that is just not possible under
 
00:31:12.769 --> 00:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
the private reimbursement model
 
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 22 Casa Advocates spent over
 
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
89 000 hours on their cases they drove
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
over 460 000 miles and they had more
 
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
than 15 000 visits with their children
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
under the new reimbursement rates of
 
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
ninety dollars an hour that time
 
00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
commitment alone would cost the state
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
over 8 million dollars
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
the cases coming to Casa and the
 
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
children coming to Casa have become
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
increasingly complex
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic reports of suspected
 
00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect were
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
delayed when children were not in school
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
and not being seen by other people in
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
the community
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
once those reports were made there is a
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
delay in the services because of the
 
00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage that we're all facing
 
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
and so Casa is working with children who
 
00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
have levels of trauma that are really
 
00:32:06.659 --> 00:32:08.810 align:start position:0%
have levels of trauma that are really
unbelievable

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
unbelievable
 
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.430 align:start position:0%
unbelievable
um

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 19 Casa worked with 52
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
children who had lost a parent
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 22 that number increased to
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
108 children who had lost a parent
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
in the past year Casa spent an average
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
of 262 hours per case and had 44 visits
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
with the children involved
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
because of the increased complexity
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
causes small legal staff has had to be
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
involved in more and more of these cases
 
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
they're now working in almost a third of
 
00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
all child protection cases coming into
 
00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:46.789 align:start position:0%
all child protection cases coming into
casa

00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
casa
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
we are requesting a two hundred thousand
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
dollar increase
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
this funding would be used to address
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
the workforce shortage
 
00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
increased need for legal Staffing and
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
the continued Recruitment and Retention
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
of the volunteers that help Casa
 
00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:09.049 align:start position:0%
of the volunteers that help Casa
function

00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
our budget line 1101 is for the non-casa
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
Guardians at litem
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
um again they are assigned when Casa is
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
unavailable but uh Casa have bends over
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
backwards to make their Advocates
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
available and on numerous occasions
 
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
judges will reach out and say this case
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
needs a casa and Marty and her group
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
always step up and make that happen
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
for the cases where Casa is unavailable
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
and there has not been a request private
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
Guardians step up and fill that need our
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized need of 250 000
 
00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
is a reflection of the increase in the
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.930 --> 00:33:58.940 align:start position:0%
the guardian ad litem fund which is
 
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
1092. it also covers the cost of private
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
Guardians and Litem in the termination
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
of parental rights cases that follows a
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
child protection case where the parent
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
has not been able to correct
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
pay for attorneys on guardianship of
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
minor and incapacitated adults out of
 
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
this line
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important to also note
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
that there's recent legislation that
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
authorizes the judicial Council to pay
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
for the services other than Council on
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
these cases and we expect that that will
 
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
as I think most of you are aware the
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
judicial Council serves as the
 
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
pass-through for the state's commitment
 
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
to the Civil legal needs of indigent
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
residents through an appropriation to
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legal assistance
 
00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
our additional prioritized need of 750
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
000 for this program would focus on New
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance and domestic
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
violence advocacy project
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence advocacy project
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
was founded over 20 years ago to provide
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
civil legal aid to survivors of domestic
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
violence sexual assault stalking and
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
human trafficking
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
nhla attorneys represent survivors and
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
protective order hearings and related
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
family law matters
 
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
these staff members work collaboratively
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
with the staff at the domestic violence
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
crisis centers across the state and the
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
vast majority of clients at nhla are
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
referred by the crisis center advocate
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
right now nhla attorneys represent
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
clients across the state
 
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
but there is not sufficient Staffing to
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
accept every case
 
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
their focus is on assisting survivors
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
who are at high risk of lethal violence
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch recently issued a
 
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
report from its task force on domestic
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
violence cases and that report noted
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
that less than 15 percent of survivors
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
have representation at a protective
 
00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:12.500 align:start position:0%
order hearing
 
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
nhla is committed to this crucial work
 
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
they've received Voca grants and
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
vawa I'm not sure if that's vawa but
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
that's what I would I apologize for that
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
um they've received funding as well from
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
the legal assistance for victims grants
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
this additional prioritized need would
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
support between five and six new staff
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys who would be solely focused on
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
this work and would significantly
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
increase the representation for
 
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
survivors at a critical time in their
 
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.890 align:start position:0%
survivors at a critical time in their
lives

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony
 
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to go back pre-pandemic and
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
specifically about the the Indigent
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
Council uh how would you describe what
 
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find out is
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
how much of this is is covert related
 
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
and how much is a long-term problem that
 
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
prior to say in 2019 the early part of
 
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
2020 fiscal year 2020. how would you
 
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
describe the program then compared to
 
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.650 align:start position:0%
describe the program then compared to
now

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question up
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic we were seeing an
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
increase in the time to disposition for
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
and we actually
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
invited the sixth amendment Center here
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
to do an assessment of our Indigent
 
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
defense program and a large
 
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:41.099 align:start position:0%
part of that request was to help us
 
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
determine why cases were taking longer
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
to resolve
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
uh and we we did not get an answer to
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
that uh important question but it does
 
00:37:53.329 --> 00:37:53.339 align:start position:0%
seem that there are a a number of
 
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
factors that have played into that I
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
think that we even before the pandemic
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
the effects of the opioid crisis were
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
complicating factors that both defense
 
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
counsel and prosecutors and the courts
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with
 
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
we also saw
 
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.930 align:start position:0%
we also saw
um

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
some changes in the procedures at the
 
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.730 align:start position:0%
some changes in the procedures at the
court

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:18.740 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
the switch to e-filing and and some
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
other changes that made the court system
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps more efficient but change the
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
way the defense Council was interacting
 
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:35.060 align:start position:0%
with the cases and that has I think
 
00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
especially by more experienced attorneys
 
00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
I think that that switch was difficult
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
so we had the opioid crisis we had some
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
changes to court procedure
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
cases had been the the backlog had been
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
creeping up before the pandemic for
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
those reasons
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know five six seven years ago
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
the public defender had
 
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
had a really reached equilibrium in
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
terms of open and closed cases so if
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
they brought in 27 000 new cases during
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
the course of a year they were closing
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
roughly the same amount of cases but
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
that started to shift prior to the
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
pandemic and so certainly the pandemic
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
was the the final straw if you will but
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
looking back we saw that the pieces were
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
coming into place that would lead to
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
this where we are right now okay thank
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
you uh in the article in your handout
 
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
you passed I believe it's in the Concord
 
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
Monitor it states that there were 32
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
attorneys departed over a 15-month
 
00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.010 align:start position:0%
attorneys departed over a 15-month
period

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh and and from your other from your
 
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:53.540 align:start position:0%
other charts they were very experienced
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys I wonder if you could just if
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
you had anecdotal evidence on why they
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
all left was it did they retire did they
 
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
just fed up with the job the pay wasn't
 
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
enough what was the overriding reasons
 
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think what we've heard and I
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
can certainly ask Sarah Rothman to speak
 
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
in more detail about this but it is
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
again it's been a combination of factors
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
the the packages available through
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
private practice uh over the past few
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
years have been exceptionally high and
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
we lost attorneys to Private Practice in
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we've lost attorneys to
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
public defender programs in other states
 
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:35.660 align:start position:0%
especially Massachusetts
 
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
cpcs pays attorneys a much higher rate
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
and it also has a much lower caseload
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
cap and so it's been hard to keep
 
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
attorneys who have the opportunity to
 
00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:50.900 align:start position:0%
make more money and have fewer cases
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps just south of our border
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
we also have seen attorneys starting
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
their own private practice and I think
 
00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:03.740 align:start position:0%
that there has been a level of burnout
 
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
not just in this profession but in many
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
professions since the pandemic when
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
there were outbreaks and covet outbreaks
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the jails across the state many
 
00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
attorneys from both the contract and the
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
public defender program
 
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
had to actually make life or death
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
decisions about whether to go visit a
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
client if they had underlying health
 
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
issues if they lived with a family
 
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
member who had underlying health issues
 
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
so I think that this job has become much
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
more challenging during the course of
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and overall we are seeing
 
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
that fewer and fewer attorneys Who come
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
out of law school with significant debt
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
how confident are you that the what what
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
the packages you're proposing here will
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
be sufficient to bring in the attorneys
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
that you desperately need for this
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
program that's a very good question so
 
00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
as you can see we've lost quite a few
 
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
experienced public defenders from that
 
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
from the program that we have
 
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I have had conversations with a few
 
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
former public defenders who tell me that
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
they are interested in working with an
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
alternative public defender program
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
um they are folks who have more
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
experience and I think could create a
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
more Nimble program of attorneys that
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
are able to take on the serious felonies
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
incarcerated cases and perhaps be a
 
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
model where we don't have the mentoring
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
and the training that happens in the
 
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
public defender office but we're really
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
focused on experienced lawyers who can
 
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
handle a higher volume of more serious
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
cases so I do think that you know the
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage is absolutely a
 
00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
reality and that has played a
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
significant role in the crisis but I
 
00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
believe that there are attorneys who are
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
experienced and still committed to
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
Indigent defense who may be willing to
 
00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
do this work in a different capacity
 
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
okay one last question from me uh we in
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
in the budget you have significant
 
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
increases in the public defender program
 
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
the contract counseling the assigned
 
00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.530 align:start position:0%
the contract counseling the assigned
Council

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
Council
 
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh Devil's Advocate question do we need
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
to do all three
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
for example if we fully funded the the
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
public defender program and it it worked
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
the way you you think it's going to work
 
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
you know can we keep the other two the
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
assigned Council and the contract
 
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
Council fairly close to where they are
 
00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:41.270 align:start position:0%
Council fairly close to where they are
now

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
I think is the million dollar question
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
um so multi-million dollars
 
00:43:47.359 --> 00:43:49.069 align:start position:0%
um so multi-million dollars
yes

00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
um so I think that right now we have the
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
the worst situation possible we have a
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
public defender that cannot take the
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
percentage of cases it used to take we
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
have a contract attorney program that's
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
not able to take the Overflow and then
 
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
we have private attorneys who have never
 
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.530 align:start position:0%
we have private attorneys who have never
been

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:08.540 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
expected or resourced to take the
 
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
Overflow from that and so I think that
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the next biennium we will have
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
increased costs for all of these
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
programs but if there is a secondary or
 
00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
alternative public defender program I
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
think that our Reliance on assigned
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
council is going to decrease
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
significantly and it won't happen right
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
away but we will not have the need to
 
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
reach out to 20 attorneys for an
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerated client if we have another
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
firm that is ready willing and able to
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
take every case that comes in
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
um so I think I see increased costs
 
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
during the next biennium but if we are
 
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
fully funded I believe that our assigned
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
Council costs will decrease dramatically
 
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
and the contract attorney program has
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
had natural attrition it's still a very
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
vital important part of our Indigent
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
defense system but I do not anticipate
 
00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be any meaningful
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
increase in the lawyers willing to enter
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
into the contract attorney program okay
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
thank you I know the judicial Council
 
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
has lost a lot of a lot of people over
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
the last few years but the the biggest
 
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
loss they've they are going to suffer is
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
when you leave uh you are there's their
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
strongest Advocate and you will be
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
missed thank you for your service thank
 
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
I couldn't agree with that more
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask James this question
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
just a little differently and I have to
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
um if there's limited funding available
 
00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
and we can't fully fund all the
 
00:45:52.329 --> 00:45:52.339 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs is it better to fund
 
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
one one or two of the projects or
 
00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
proposals that you have in its entirety
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
or spread out that amount of money a
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
little bit in each area you know as
 
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
example instead of saying I'm and I'm
 
00:46:05.089 --> 00:46:05.099 align:start position:0%
gonna I don't know the exact numbers but
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
three million just to the public
 
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.030 align:start position:0%
three million just to the public
defender

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
defender
 
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
um you know a million here 250
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
if you didn't have a full you know could
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
do a full three million to public
 
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
defender and nothing of something else
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
or is it better to say I'll give them
 
00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
each half a million like what would work
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
better if you had to choose in terms of
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
those scenarios that's a that's a tough
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
question but what we have seen and what
 
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:29.579 align:start position:0%
I believe will continue to be true is
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
that the public defender has got to be
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
fully funded
 
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
I I cannot emphasize enough what a
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
crucial role that program plays and even
 
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
just a 12-month period of the public
 
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
defender not being at full capacity has
 
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
had a devastating effect
 
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.130 align:start position:0%
had a devastating effect
okay

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
um and then a separate question is I
 
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
know that you have the ability to to
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
reach into funds not otherwise
 
00:46:59.690 --> 00:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
appropriated when the budget is not
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
sufficient and the budget of around 30
 
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
million that's there does that for
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
example in 22 include those dollars from
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
funds not always appropriated or if it
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't how much extra had you had to go
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
and ask for so for
 
00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:17.099 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this is
 
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:20.220 align:start position:0%
um if I'm responding to the question but
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
our request for
 
00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099 align:start position:0%
all of the budget lines the assigned
 
00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:29.339 align:start position:0%
Council the services those are the no
 
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
are real numbers those are the numbers
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
that we expect we will need to get
 
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
through the next biennium
 
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
um and so it does not anticipate going
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
back to the fiscal although I know they
 
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
love it when we do yeah
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
um but these are numbers to fully fund
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
all of our budget lines do you um have
 
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
any guesstimate or estimate on in the
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
last fiscal year what you had to go back
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
to fiscal for
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
so the last fiscal year is is tricky
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
because we went back for the public
 
00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
defender program which you know is very
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
rare we received an additional 2.4
 
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh for the public
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
defender program we had to go back for
 
00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
services other than Council and assigned
 
00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.670 align:start position:0%
services other than Council and assigned
Council

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
Council
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and I will give you the exact numbers
 
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
I apologize I don't I don't have those
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
right here and I should
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
um but really the the biggest unmet need
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
in the appropriation that we received
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
for this biennium is Services other than
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
Council and we had requested an
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized need of just shy
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
of five hundred thousand dollars for
 
00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:44.579 align:start position:0%
those expenses uh but even that estimate
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
ended up being low I mean we'll we'll
 
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
need about this year we'll need almost
 
00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
double the appropriation
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:17.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite Health and Human
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.079 --> 00:49:54.609 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:49:54.609 --> 00:49:54.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%

white the CFO of the department being
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
said I am
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
very close to being done with my tenure
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
I am going to give the lead to both
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%

Officer of the Department of Health and

Human Services I'm here with you today
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
to present the state fiscal year 2425
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS agency budget request
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
and I I uh we're going to be covering
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
things at a pretty high level I think I
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
chalked it down about 160 million
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
dollars a minute given the time frame so
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
we will be going through through things
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
rather quickly I won't be covering
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
everything but we will touch on some
 
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
highlights so on page two of the
 
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
document that I have in front of you
 
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
there's a high level agenda and we're
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to first just kind of touch on
 
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
Mission Vision or Mission
 
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
responsibilities caseload organization
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
Staffing and then get into the
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget request as well as
 
00:51:06.049 --> 00:51:06.059 align:start position:0%
some of the prioritized needs
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
um you see laid out there the mission of
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
the department which to join communities
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
and families and providing an
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity for citizens to achieve
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
health and Independence and this really
 
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
comes down to meeting the basic health
 
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
needs of basic human needs of our
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
citizens and protecting the the most
 
00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:22.910 align:start position:0%
citizens and protecting the the most
vulnerable

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
on page four uh there is a high level uh
 
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
overview of some of the responsibilities
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
of DHHS that are statutorily required of
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
us to educate the public and providers
 
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
on navigating complex systems of care I
 
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
think you know Medicaid typically comes
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
to mind Medicaid to schools things of
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
that nature as well as the next bullet
 
00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:46.700 align:start position:0%
there delivery of services to clients
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
and we do this through our district
 
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
offices which are located across the
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
state where we provide Direct Services
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
to the citizens of New Hampshire we have
 
00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
contracted community-based organizations
 
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
at any point in time the department may
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
have anywhere from 500 to 800 live and
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
active contracts some of those may be
 
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
with non-profits within the community
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
some of those may be with more of the
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
I.T related contracts or by direct
 
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
support to the department to support our
 
00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.670 align:start position:0%
support to the department to support our
systems

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
they're they're below that you'll see
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
the client services call center where I
 
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
think you know when you think of like
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire easy or something like
 
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
that where we help people get signed up
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
for various benefits and then below that
 
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
there is also Direct Care
 
00:52:34.329 --> 00:52:34.339 align:start position:0%
um DHHS has a number of Direct Care
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
Facilities New Hampshire hospital Glenco
 
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
Glencliff home Hampstead Hospital and
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
some new Youth Services treatment center
 
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:42.980 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to talk a little bit about
 
00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital in the recent
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
acquisition later on in the presentation
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
we protect the health and safety of our
 
00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.730 align:start position:0%
we protect the health and safety of our
citizens

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
um the the first bullet there protect
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
children and adults from abuse and
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
neglect DC White you know when you think
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
of that I think of division of children
 
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
youth and families division of long-term
 
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
supports and services uh we provide it
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
we assist with providing housing
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
supports for those who are at risk of
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
becoming homeless or are homeless as
 
00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:11.390 align:start position:0%
becoming homeless or are homeless as
well

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
and then finally down down at the bottom
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
um one thing that that we also provide
 
00:53:19.609 --> 00:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
is regulatory oversight for licensing of
 
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities Child Care
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
Facilities Food Service businesses as
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
well so moving on to slide number five
 
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
this is a very high level overview of
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
some of the caseloads
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and and the historical caseloads that
 
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
we have seen in recent Years you'll
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
probably notice two major Trends on the
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
right with with TANF and a to the
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
permanently and totally disabled as well
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
as snap you'll know you'll notice a
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
subtle decrease here what we're seeing
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
there is typically as the economy does
 
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
better we do see decreases in those
 
00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
caseload numbers so if if we are
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
potentially predicting some type of
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
recession we may anticipate some of
 
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
those uh some of those to start to
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
increase in subsequent years following
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
any sort of major change in the economic
 
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.730 align:start position:0%
any sort of major change in the economic
status

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
and on the left side there you will also
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
notice beginning in 2020 particularly in
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid realm you will see an
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
increase and please note this is as of
 
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
September 1 this data here there'll be
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
another slide with more up-to-date data
 
00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
but what you will see there is you will
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
see that uptick and I'm going to talk a
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
little bit later about continuous
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
enrollment under the public health
 
00:54:31.609 --> 00:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
emergency and Medicaid unwind and and
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
during that time frame we have been
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
required to keep individuals on the
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rolls in order to continue to
 
00:54:41.089 --> 00:54:41.099 align:start position:0%
receive an additional 6.2 Federal match
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to talk a little bit about
 
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
that later on
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
so moving quickly on to slide six
 
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
um so DHHS if you look at the current
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
operating budget depending on how you
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
want to split the numbers we are roughly
 
00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:56.579 align:start position:0%
45 of the total operating budget we're
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
55 of federal General and other funds
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
and we're about 66 percent of uh federal
 
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
funds for the entire state budget so I
 
00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
just want to take a minute to go over
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
the overall organization of the
 
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.290 align:start position:0%
the overall organization of the
department

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
at the top you have commissioner
 
00:55:11.579 --> 00:55:13.370 align:start position:0%
at the top you have commissioner
shibanet

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
shibanet
 
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
um and then on moving over to the left
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
side you have the Deputy Commissioner
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
overseeing Information Services our
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
human resources facilities the division
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
of program quality Integrity as well as
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
the employee assistance program which
 
00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
actually provides services to many other
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
state agencies not just within the
 
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
and we actually allocate costs to some
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
of those other agencies you will see
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
that in our budget
 
00:55:40.609 --> 00:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
shifting to the right side we have three
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
associate Commissioners Ann Landry
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
Marissa hen and Chris santinello and
 
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
Inland Rishi oversees the division of
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid services and the
 
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity uh Marissa hen

and Hampstead Hospital
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
and finally Chris sent now she oversees
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
the division of Economic and housing
 
00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
supports and the division of long-term
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
supports and services if you shift down
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom you'll see our chief
 
00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
medical officer Dr Jonathan Ballard our
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
CEO of New Hampshire hospital is Ellen
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
Lapointe and she has oversight over at
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliff home you'll see Chief
 
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer myself overseeing the
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
division of finance and procurement and
 
00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:26.099 align:start position:0%
then finally our chief legal officer
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
Melissa sancer overseeing Regulatory and
 
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
Licensing services
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
so moving on to page seven we'll we'll
 
00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
move into the Staffing conversation here
 
00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a couple of things
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
that will probably immediately jump out
 
00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
um our division of Medicaid services uh
 
00:56:45.049 --> 00:56:45.059 align:start position:0%
if you if you take a look at that
 
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
there's there's 31 positions there not
 
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
all of those are full currently
 
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
um that team oversees approximately 1.2
 
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
billion dollars which is a pretty
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
significant chunk of our budget uh the
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
division for children Youth and Family
 
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
excuse me dividend for children youth
 
00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
and families has a lot of Direct Care uh
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
individuals whether it's at City new
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
Youth Services Center Juvenile Justice
 
00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:08.099 align:start position:0%
or Child Protective Service workers a
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
lot of those individuals are out in the
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
field on a regular basis
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
we also have New Hampshire hospital
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
Glenn clip foam in Hampstead are also 24
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
7 facilities so you'll see New Hampshire
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
hospital has almost 700 authorized
 
00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.049 align:start position:0%
hospital has almost 700 authorized
positions

00:57:24.049 --> 00:57:24.059 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:57:26.809 --> 00:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
now in contradistinction to that you'll
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
see Hampstead Hospital Residential
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
Treatment Facility only has 21. some of
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
you may be aware that we've chosen a
 
00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:36.059 align:start position:0%
different operating model for that
 
00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
particular facility and that will impact
 
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
one of our prioritized needs that you'll
 
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
see in our request and what we've done
 
00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
there in at New Hampshire hospital the
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
nurses the mental health the social
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
workers all of those individuals are
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
classified state employees we've taken a
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
different approach with Hampstead
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
Hospital where we have six members that
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
are unclassified that are executive
 
00:57:59.329 --> 00:57:59.339 align:start position:0%
senior executive level overseeing that
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
facility as well as about 15 classified
 
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:04.140 align:start position:0%
staff that are looking at they they deal
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
with more of the facilities the accounts
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
payable accounts receivable whereas all
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
the direct care of the mental health
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
workers social workers nurses those are
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
clinicians those are all handled by a
 
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
private contractor currently
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
if you move on to page eight um we're
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
going to look at some of the historical
 
00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.370 align:start position:0%
going to look at some of the historical
Staffing

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
um and and this does feed into some of
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs requests and and
 
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm talking to you about it
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
today so I think the most striking thing
 
00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
here is if you look at 2019 we had a
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
12.4 vacancy rate if you look at today's
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
rate we're we're right around 21
 
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
vacancy and there's obviously been a
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
number of factors uh March of 2020 code
 
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
19 pandemic hit we saw a number of folks
 
00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
leave at the outset of that we were also
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
put under as was All State agencies at
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
that time an executive order as a hiring
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
freeze now concurrently we also had a 30
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar back of the budget cut in
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
20 20 21 and then we had a 22.6 million
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
dollar back of the budget cut for the
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
current biennium the difference being in
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
this biennium it was a personnel only
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
related back of the budget cut so one of
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
the first things that I did when I took
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
over this past spring was sent out a
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
listing to every division director
 
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
saying you need to hold X number of
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
positions vacant and what's that what
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
that has done on in order to hit that is
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
it's really limited our ability to
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
actually post many of our positions
 
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
which you know just continues to kind of
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
feed into that vacancy rate that we
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
experience we do have some prioritized
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
needs requests that I'm not going to go
 
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
into too much detail today on uh for
 
00:59:36.849 --> 00:59:36.859 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire hospital to continue
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
enhancements that are current that were
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
relatively recently approved by GNC to
 
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
make those those particular positions
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
competitive with the private Market
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
you've probably already heard and I know
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
this has been a general theme of some of
 
00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
these hearings some of the challenges
 
00:59:55.609 --> 00:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
that we have had in our hiring and we
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
are certainly no exception and it varies
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
from from area to facility so our nurses
 
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
we have a much harder time I think it's
 
01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:06.299 align:start position:0%
roughly 40 some odd percent vacancy rate
 
01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital now if you
 
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
contrast that against the private
 
01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
the private organization that we work
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
with at Hampstead I think they're at
 
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
about 80 some odd percent filled
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
positions for their nurses so they have
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
a little bit more flexibility in order
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
to hire that we do not currently have we
 
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
also do have a prioritized need for New
 
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital asking for additional
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
funding to utilize the statute that was
 
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
relatively recently approved for New
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital glencliffe and other
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
Direct Care positions in order to
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
provide Recruitment and Retention
 
01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.210 align:start position:0%
provide Recruitment and Retention
bonuses

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
bonuses
 
01:00:44.089 --> 01:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
now one other really important thing to
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
understand about some of the challenges
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
that we do have and how that feeds into
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
our overall budget is when we are short
 
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
staffed or we do have a significant High
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
number of vacancies or we are required
 
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
to hold those positions vacant we do put
 
01:00:58.970 --> 01:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
federal funds at risk either through
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
audit findings or paybacks or other
 
01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:05.339 align:start position:0%
potential negative consequences as well
 
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
as Service delivery so well we may save
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of dollars by holding
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
positions vacant we do in the long run
 
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
create some potential risks that may be
 
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
acceptable but certainly need to be
 
01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.789 align:start position:0%
acceptable but certainly need to be
acknowledged

01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
acknowledged
 
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
if you move to the next page uh page
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
nine this is the efficiency budget
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
request is the high level and this
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
includes all funds
 
01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
um I think the the division of Medicaid
 
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
services certainly jumps out at you um
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
this is certainly one of our one of our
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
higher uh cost areas um but again this
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
is the the Managed Care organizations
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
and the the contract is north of 1.2
 
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
um the another large areas uh division
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
of long-term supports and services
 
01:01:54.289 --> 01:01:54.299 align:start position:0%
um this is what you'll see in those
 
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
class lines are the dollars for DD
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
nursing home amquip Pro share uh we have
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
one accounting unit alone that's 300
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
million over 300 million dollars in that
 
01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.930 align:start position:0%
million over 300 million dollars in that
area

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
um you'll see the prioritizing these
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
requests at approximately 3.5 billion
 
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
dollars in 24 and 3.6 billion dollars in
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 25. our prioritized
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
need we do expect to be able to get that
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
down when we submitted our agency
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
request when we were working on this
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
about four or five months ago we had to
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
make certain assumptions about what we
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
anticipated the various needs in in the
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
community to be we have since worked
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
with those and we hope to continue to
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
work with James in the governor's office
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
as we go forward to get those figures
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
down and so I think if you move to the
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
next page on page 10 that general fund
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at here is total
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
General funds only
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
and there are in in our prioritized need
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
I I just want to recognize that we do
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
have about total roughly 20 million
 
01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.339 align:start position:0%
dollars of legislative initiatives that
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
were passed related to Medicaid and
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
ambulatory rates
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
um and birthing center rates and in and
 
01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:09.980 align:start position:0%
out Services
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
as well as from Seinfeld 444 about a
 
01:03:15.049 --> 01:03:15.059 align:start position:0%
million dollars for Family Resource
 
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
Centers as well those are reflected
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
currently in in the prioritized needs
 
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
column there were a few other things our
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
our mmis operating budget was placed
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
into hb2 from this prior session that's
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 million dollars General funds
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
11 and 24 or 11 million dollars in
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 uh 41 million roughly
 
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
total we are hoping to get that back
 
01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
into our efficiency budget and get that
 
01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
out of hp2 but that is also reflected in
 
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
that prioritized need line in front of
 
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.329 align:start position:0%
that prioritized need line in front of
you

01:03:46.329 --> 01:03:46.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
so I will let's be before we get into
 
01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:53.339 align:start position:0%
prioritize need on page 11 of the
 
01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
document in front of you we do have a
 
01:03:57.289 --> 01:03:57.299 align:start position:0%
slide here and it's this function
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
Centric circle slide to try to outline
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
some of the complexity of dhhs's budget
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
um I I do wish at times it was a little
 
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
bit more simple but uh For Better or For
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
Worse it is not but it is explainable
 
01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
um so on the right I I'd like to start
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
with the cost allocation so we usually
 
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
we utilize a cost allocation system at
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS and what that allows us to do is it
 
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
allows us to better leverage federal
 
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.410 align:start position:0%
allows us to better leverage federal
dollars

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
um and for example we have we have
 
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
executive level leadership positions
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
today that are paid with over 250
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
various Federal sources of funding
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
um and and that that certainly adds a
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
layer of complexity to our budget on the
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
left there we have our budget we make
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
certain Revenue estimates we make
 
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
certain predictions for what the needs
 
01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
are in the bottom we have our actual
 
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
experience we of course need to balance
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
that against the laps HHS is typically
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
looked at for the largest portion of the
 
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
lapse as my prior comments about the
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
size of our budget
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned earlier that certainly
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense and that's something that we
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
are constantly constantly keeping an eye
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
on as well as managing those those back
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
of the budget cuts I think one
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
complexity that we have that many other
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
state agencies may not necessarily have
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
is our Direct Care organizations they
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
actually receive patient revenue and in
 
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
order to receive patient Revenue we need
 
01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
to be able to have patients come in in
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
order to receive individuals coming in
 
01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
we need to have staff and if we have
 
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:27.140 align:start position:0%
Staffing challenges
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
and we're not able to compensate them
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
enough then we lose out on that revenue
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's this kind of
 
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
interesting Catch-22 relationship there
 
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
between having adequate staff and having
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
additional revenues which would offset
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
general fund expenditures in those
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
particular areas so um long story short
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
the key takeaway from this slide is as
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
we move into the um the upcoming budget
 
01:05:51.059 --> 01:05:52.609 align:start position:0%
we move into the um the upcoming budget
discussions

01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
um just pointing out the complexity of
 
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
on page 12 so let's talk a little bit
 
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
about our prioritized needs and honestly
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to cover over 100 million
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
dollars of prioritizing these in the
 
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
next couple of slides but giving them
 
01:06:05.099 --> 01:06:06.289 align:start position:0%
next couple of slides but giving them
time

01:06:06.289 --> 01:06:06.299 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
um that's what we'll do so Medicaid
 
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment so
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
we have been uh the public health
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
emergency has been in place since 2020
 
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
and DHHS has earned an additional 6.2
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
Federal Medicaid assistance percentage
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
now this has been conditioned on on
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment of Medicaid
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and yet we have not known
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
when the public health emergency is
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
going to end I think this has been a big
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
question you've probably seen this in
 
01:06:44.809 --> 01:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
the news and it's come up many times now
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
we've continued to work on making
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
redeterminations every 12 months for our
 
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
for the for the beneficiaries that we do
 
01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
have but at the bottom there you will
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
see some of the enrollment Trends prior
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
back in February 2019 through October of
 
01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
this year overall we've seen a 36
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
percent increase because those those are
 
01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
all the individuals that have come on
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that we have not been able to
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
disenroll in order to continue to
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
receive that 6.22 as of September last
 
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
time I ran the numbers we had received
 
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
about 33
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
332 million dollars of um of additional
 
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
fmap through Medicaid continuous
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment uh now the grand Advantage
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
expansion group this is obviously the
 
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
highest increase that you see there
 
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen over a roughly 79 increasing
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
growth on
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
page 13
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple of little not quite
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
boxes but I'll call them boxes so
 
01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
currently as of today the public health
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
emergency is scheduled to end April 11th
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
if that happens and and that's kind of a
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
big if
 
01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
if that happens we can begin the unwind
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
process on May 1st we would continue to
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
receive the 6.2 fmap
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
through June 30th of 2023. we do expect
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
to receive and and this has been stated
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
publicly by the federal government many
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
times that we will receive 60 AIDS
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
notice so that puts us right around the
 
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
beginning of February
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
now if this happens the fmap will return
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
to 50 50 for standard Medicaid it will
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
return to 65 percent for chip expansion
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
I think just one important note
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
expansion is already at the max fmap
 
01:08:35.329 --> 01:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
possible it's already at 90 10 so
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
there's there'll be no change there that
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
will just continue as as is
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
now we have been working actively on
 
01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
continuing to make sure that we uh we we
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
conduct we determined redeterminations
 
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
on individuals that are currently
 
01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
enrolled and
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
um once once the disenrollment process
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
begins I think it's really important to
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
note that all of these individuals have
 
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to appeal
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
in a typical year we deal with about a
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
thousand appeals we don't know how many
 
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
individuals will appeal I think that's
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's kind of an X Factor and that will
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
be hard for us to predict but if an
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
individual does appeal that would mean
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
that they would continue to receive
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
Medicaid benefits and that's kind of the
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
big X Factor and the unknown
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
um that that we don't yet necessarily
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
have an answer before I think that's
 
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult to predict
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
on page 14 I get into a couple of the
 
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs that are directly
 
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
related to this you will see in our
 
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
agency budget requests we put in uh
 
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
collectively a 28 million 28 million
 
01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.669 align:start position:0%
collectively a 28 million 28 million
dollars

01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
um now for the individuals who would
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
continue to be on the program who may
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
not be eligible
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
now that was worst case scenario and we
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
do hope to and and we hope to get words
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
sooner than later as to when the public
 
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
health emergency will land that was
 
01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
assuming it would end in October uh we
 
01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:01.940 align:start position:0%
hope it will will end earlier than that
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
I can't make any promises though but
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
that would cover essentially that that
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
shortfall that we would experience in in
 
01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
losing the 6.2 F map we also have a
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
prioritized need for a call center to
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
support the eligibility redetermination
 
01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:20.060 align:start position:0%
work we do expect
 
01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:23.300 align:start position:0%
as the disenrollment process
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
starts to have many many questions come
 
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
in and it's a tier we would plan for
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
tier one call center they wouldn't be
 
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
conducting eligibility but they would be
 
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
the individuals that would help steer
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
those individuals towards the correct
 
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.410 align:start position:0%
those individuals towards the correct
um

01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:38.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
individual to use that word again
 
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
um one one other element here that is
 
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
not necessarily reflected in a
 
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
prioritized need as of today is we
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
expect the individuals that would be
 
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
disenrolled from Medicaid to likely be
 
01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
to be lower Acuity so in the long run as
 
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
this process unfolds the individuals
 
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
that would continue to be on Medicaid
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
would likely be of a higher Acuity
 
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
Acuity nature and that would cause the
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
actuarially determined rates to
 
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
potentially increase which could have an
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
impact so while we would see you know
 
01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
the actual numbers go down we may
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
potentially see an increase in the per
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
member per month cost that we would
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
experience we if the if if the PHD does
 
01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
end in May or excuse me April and the
 
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
disenrollment begins in may we would
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
likely stagger based on some of the CMS
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
guidance that has been provided of
 
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
disenrolling one-ninth of the of the
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
potential population each each month we
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
would Target those that we think would
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
be the least likely to appeal those that
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
were were fairly certain would not
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
continue to qualify for Medicaid first
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
and that would also set us up for
 
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
success in subsequent years so that
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
um we wouldn't attempt to disenroll a
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
number of people and then have a number
 
01:11:59.450 --> 01:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
of appeals and then next year everybody
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
all the redeterminations would be
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
required at the same time during the
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
following year
 
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
so moving on to page 15
 
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
um so starting with Hampstead Hospital
 
01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment Center so the
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
state and I don't know if this is the
 
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
first time in New Hampshire history but
 
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
uh first time in recent memory we
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
acquired a Hampstead Hospital
 
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
and that that acquisition became
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
effective June 8th of 2022. we Hampstead
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
Hospital primarily serves Youth and
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
Young adults with acute psychiatric
 
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
needs we are in the process of
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
attempting to open up a psychiatric
 
01:12:42.729 --> 01:12:42.739 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment Facility as well
 
01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
in calendar year 23.
 
01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
the the operating budget
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
um that was approved by the fiscal
 
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
committee uh this um included
 
01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
approximately nine million dollars of
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
arpathons um we have requested an
 
01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
equivalent amount of General funds for
 
01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
the upcoming biennium in the first year
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh to cover to cover the costs of the
 
01:13:07.729 --> 01:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
existing contract
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
um One Challenge here is we don't have a
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
history on what the patient revenues
 
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
will be we really only have a several
 
01:13:16.729 --> 01:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
you know since June we really only have
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
several months of actual actual Revenue
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
so I think it's difficult to predict
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
long term historically what we expect
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
those to be based on some of the
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
information that we've seen coming out
 
01:13:32.050 --> 01:13:32.060 align:start position:0%
we do potentially expect the second year
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal year 25 where we would
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
be going back out compared to
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
competitively bid that contract we do
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
expect some of those contracted costs to
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
increase I think the report released by
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
The New Hampshire hospital association's
 
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
quoted something like 116 percent
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
increase has been experienced in
 
01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
contracted Staffing costs at hospitals
 
01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.070 align:start position:0%
contracted Staffing costs at hospitals
so

01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
um we that's that's the reason why you
 
01:13:58.729 --> 01:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
do see that year over year um that
 
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
significant increase there
 
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
the forensic facility
 
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
um as as you know uh during this past uh
 
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
each this current or this prior HB to
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 million dollars was
 
01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the department to build
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
the forensic facility roughly eight
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
million dollar 8.75 million dollars a
 
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
year prior was appropriated in hb2 and
 
01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
you recently did see the department come
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
forward to the fiscal committee to
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
transfer some funds in order to address
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
some of the increased construction costs
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
that we have been experiencing due to
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
rampant inflation
 
01:14:37.729 --> 01:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
um and and the labor market currently we
 
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
are scheduled to open in state fiscal
 
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
year 25 we do have a prioritized need in
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 they're it's 100 General funds
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
we researched we looked we could not
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
find any potential Federal source that
 
01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
we could utilize for this particular
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
facility at this time it's 19 million
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
dollars in general funds the first year
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
24 million dollars in general funds
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
second year you're probably thinking
 
01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
well why do you need funding the first
 
01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
year prior to it opening our intent and
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
our goal was to bring in staff have them
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
trained and ready to go on day one
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's also dollars included in that
 
01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
first year request in order to hire an
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
external consultant to conduct a
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
national search to try to bring in staff
 
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
to address some of the challenges that
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
we we obviously collectively are
 
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
experiencing relative to the labor
 
01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.630 align:start position:0%
experiencing relative to the labor
market

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
um the next item there it is not a
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
traditional prioritized need it is not
 
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
in our prioritized need column uh so New
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
Year's Services Center their their
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
budget today is currently included in
 
01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.050 align:start position:0%
budget today is currently included in
hb2

01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
um it is not found in hb1
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
um we we have requested through through
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
the hb2 process approximately 11.11.4
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars of General funds
 
01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
um under the assumption that there will
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
be uh fast-tracked legislation to
 
01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
postpone the current schedule close of
 
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
March of 20 2023 of the facility there
 
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
was legislation that that was not
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
successful this past session
 
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
um to continue that um and and I know
 
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:19.460 align:start position:0%
that our team has been working closely
 
01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
with some members of the legislature in
 
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
an attempt to Fast Track legislation to
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that we do have funding for the
 
01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
remainder of State fiscal year 23.
 
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:33.900 align:start position:0%
and we work has begun to design a
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
replacement facility for the senior use
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
on the next page
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
um the next kind of major theme Here is
 
01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.570 align:start position:0%
um the next kind of major theme Here is
rates

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
the the the first area is developmental
 
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
disabilities we have been working on um
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
the the term the new acronym is is the
 
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
dads rate the designated area agency
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
delivery services Daz is certainly a
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
little bit easier and this is to provide
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
Direct Care Services historically the
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
methodology that has been used
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
um for for for the payment model the
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
area agency's CMS has found that to be
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
non-compliant and we have been working
 
01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
over more than a year and a half now
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
maybe close to two years I believe
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
um we have been working internally with
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
a team and an external consultant to
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
bring that model into compliance as a
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
result of doing so we do initially
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
expect approximately 16.2 and 27 million
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
dollar of general fund need in those two
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
years however that figure is still the
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
moving as this work is still in
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
development the team just as a side note
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
has done a phenomenal job they've been
 
01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
out in the community I think they've met
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
with over 50 different they've held over
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
50 different sessions with
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
community-based providers other
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
interested parties and and families that
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
that are potentially affected by this
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
the next prioritized need is the choices
 
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
for Independence this this prioritized
 
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
need is based on our current projections
 
01:18:21.649 --> 01:18:21.659 align:start position:0%
I think one important thing to remember
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
here is choices for Independence it
 
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
allows individuals to receive the
 
01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:30.380 align:start position:0%
services in their homes
 
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
and nursing home services are an
 
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
entitlement whereas this is part of a
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
waiver program I think that's just
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
really a key distinction so it's kind of
 
01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
one of those areas where do you spend
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
the money and potentially save money in
 
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
in the long run and and you know I think
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
that obviously when we're talking 19
 
01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
million dollars that is certainly a
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
tricky calculation to make but I do just
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
want to recognize if individuals aren't
 
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
receiving Services here the alternative
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
is likely a nursing facility
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
um we did include a 10 million dollar
 
01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
prioritized need for Medicaid to address
 
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
ongoing required CMS rate increases as
 
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:09.950 align:start position:0%
ongoing required CMS rate increases as
well

01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
on page 17
 
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
last year with children residential
 
01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
rates last year we entered into a new
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
Contracting model with a residential
 
01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:23.300 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
and we took our best educated guess at
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
what those rates should be we have since
 
01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
looked at those and we are requesting
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
additional funding in order to modify
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
those this is another rate that we
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
continue to Monitor and we hope as we
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
get closer to the to the the the budget
 
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
rollout that we can work with work with
 
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
the governor's office or the House and
 
01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.729 align:start position:0%
the governor's office or the House and
Senate

01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
um to to better refine those once we
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
have more accurate data again this is
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
another one of those moving I don't want
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
to call it a moving Target but but it's
 
01:20:02.209 --> 01:20:02.219 align:start position:0%
it's one of those things four months ago
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
is obviously not today and we have
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
better information today than we did
 
01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.410 align:start position:0%
better information today than we did
then

01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
we have also included
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
um in each state fiscal year 10 million
 
01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
dollars of General funds to support
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
shelter Services the shelter providers
 
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
today uh they they incur about 41
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
um per person per day in operating costs
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
um we pay about eight dollars and 46
 
01:20:31.610 --> 01:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
cents per person per day this request
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
would get us about up to twenty dollars
 
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
give or take to support those those
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
shelter services to address many of the
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
ongoing challenges and I think everybody
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
here has probably seen some of the
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
potential risks there and and current
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
homeless situation across the state and
 
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
this is really intended to address that
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
the foster care rate request uh this is
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
3.25 million dollars total over the
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
whole biennium currently the rates that
 
01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
we pay are tied to the low income medium
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
or low household medium income come this
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
would increase that to the median
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
household income and we the the intent
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
there is to incentivize additional
 
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
individuals and families to participate
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the Foster Care Program
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
shifting onto page 18 this particular
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
page does not include a prioritized need
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
it does include in the table there
 
01:21:32.290 --> 01:21:32.300 align:start position:0%
you'll see safe field Skipper 24 and 25
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
11.9 11.6 million dollars of prioritized
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
needs for our I.T systems DHHS as I
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned before we are large we have
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
many different programs many different
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
divisions and of course supporting all
 
01:21:50.209 --> 01:21:50.219 align:start position:0%
those are over 139 applications some of
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
the major systems are listed there on
 
01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
the left side are mmis system our new
 
01:21:57.850 --> 01:21:57.860 align:start position:0%
heights eligibility enrollment system
 
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
historically the next item Bridges has
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
has there has been bridges for dcyf
 
01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
we've been in the process of migrating
 
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
this to a new system granted families
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
and we do have an 11 million dollar
 
01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
Capital request to support that
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
particular initiative
 
01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
um I think it's just important just to
 
01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
recognize and and I think this has
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
already been recognized I've listened to
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
a few of the budget hearings
 
01:22:26.689 --> 01:22:26.699 align:start position:0%
um that Automation in the long run um
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
while it may have some initial upfront
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
costs it may have ongoing costs it can
 
01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.149 align:start position:0%
costs it may have ongoing costs it can
increase

01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
um efficiencies across the department as
 
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
well in order to provide
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
um the services that the department is
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
required to provide
 
01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
on the next page on page 19
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
um I've only I've pulled out a couple of
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
our I.T related prioritized need I
 
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
believe we have about 16.
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
um Salesforce this is a this is a system
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
that is used across the department uh
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
collectively we have a little a little
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
over four million dollars of a
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
prioritized need over the entire
 
01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
biennium and and this is a platform that
 
01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
is used in a variety of ways can be
 
01:23:09.169 --> 01:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
customized we use a currently uh for The
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
Incident Management for New Hampshire
 
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
hospital we do it we do intend to expand
 
01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
that out to some some of our other
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
facilities and areas as well
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
um once once the work at New Hampshire
 
01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
hospital is done in the system is ready
 
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
to to be migrated and expanded
 
01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
um we this is also used for child care
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
licensing and training contact training
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
and case investigation the next item is
 
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
consulting services so as I mentioned
 
01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:38.630 align:start position:0%
consulting services so as I mentioned
earlier

01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
um or many times now we do have
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
challenges with with hiring and in our
 
01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
Information Services area last I checked
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
I think we were roughly 30 32 percent uh
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate just because it is is
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
difficult and challenging to hire this
 
01:23:58.330 --> 01:23:58.340 align:start position:0%
would allow us funding in order to hire
 
01:24:01.729 --> 01:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
Consulting Services as we need them in
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
order to augment existing systems or
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
build existing system or build new
 
01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
systems or leveraging Salesforce in
 
01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
order to create new efficiencies for the
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
department and then lastly we have a
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
request for ebi software this is roughly
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
a million dollars over the entire
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
biennium this this software I think this
 
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
is a good example this supports the
 
01:24:26.209 --> 01:24:26.219 align:start position:0%
automated data and privacy reporting and
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
compliance requirements prior to prior
 
01:24:28.679 --> 01:24:29.810 align:start position:0%
compliance requirements prior to prior
to

01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.649 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:33.500 align:start position:0%
prior to this uh this particular
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
software a lot of this was highly manual
 
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
and time and staff intensive which took
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
staff away from other priorities and
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
duties so
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
um that is all that I have today I
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
obviously covered a lot in a very short
 
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
amount of time but I will weren't happy
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
01:24:58.970 --> 01:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and thank you for your
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that a budget is a
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
financial prioritization of needs
 
01:25:08.159 --> 01:25:09.050 align:start position:0%
financial prioritization of needs
um you

01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
um you
 
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
your your department does quite a bit I
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
mean it poverty homelessness mental
 
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
health Child Care Child Abuse Public
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
Health which includes drug and alcohol
 
01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:20.900 align:start position:0%
abuse to name a few
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh and and while I imagine this list of
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
priorities would have changed I mean
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
maybe a year and a half ago if I
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned it would have clearly been
 
01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
public health because the covet epidemic
 
01:25:31.739 --> 01:25:33.950 align:start position:0%
public health because the covet epidemic
maybe

01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
um but what currently what are your
 
01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:46.610 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
I think right now our most pressing
 
01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
needs is to maintain operations as they
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
are today you know if I had to you can't
 
01:25:58.010 --> 01:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
prioritize one vulnerable population
 
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
over the other like you said
 
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
um every year there's a different area
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
that is in crisis Public Health was in
 
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
crisis during covid but you know
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
fortunately for states most of the
 
01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:14.540 align:start position:0%
coveted response was federally funded
 
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
both through Public Health dollars
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
through our cares act all of those
 
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
things we've been in an ongoing Mental
 
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
Health crisis for about a decade now we
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
have a 10-year Mental Health Plan there
 
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
was dcyf Crisis a couple of years ago so
 
01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
it's not that you can pick one area or
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
one vulnerable population over another
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
but maintaining operations as they are
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
today is our priority and then our
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs going forward
 
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
traditionally is the either the
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
expansion of those programs to the the
 
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
transformation of some of those programs
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
but I think in what's different about
 
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
this budget is some of our basic
 
01:26:56.689 --> 01:26:56.699 align:start position:0%
operations to maintain programs are in
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs this biennium so our
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs a lot of those dollars
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
actually should be in our efficiency
 
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
budget you think of things like
 
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital if we don't get that
 
01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs request we are going
 
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
to have to reduce beds so so it is
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
really about maintaining where we are
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
today and then our prioritized needs
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
should be about what's the next step in
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
Transforming Our systems both our
 
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
systems of care and our I.T systems to
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
help us better serve the people of New
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you measure
 
01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
the now you you mentioned that the
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate which I believe was just
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
over 20 percent
 
01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.530 align:start position:0%
over 20 percent
um

01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
how quickly do you believe you're going
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
to be able to fill those positions
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
meaning have you here
 
01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
you seen any increase in
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh applications and people coming into
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
the state government who want to work
 
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
for you so the the 21 is an aggregate uh
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
so a car solid Department I think is
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
Nathan alluded to earlier for Hampstead
 
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
we have seen that uptick we've seen
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
nurses go up to say an 82 percent vacant
 
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
filled rate whereas at New Hampshire
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
hospital not so much and we have
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
different infrastructure and operating
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
systems for sure so some of it is going
 
01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:27.020 align:start position:0%
to be how much we can rely on other help
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
I.E a different model to do that
 
01:28:31.149 --> 01:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
recruitment for us that doesn't
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily have some of the same
 
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
constraints that the state system does
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
that said we've made great strides I
 
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
think with the division of personnel and
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
the money that they've gotten through
 
01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
our dollars to help with our recruiting
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
retention so we are seeing an uptick but
 
01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
the challenges that as soon as you gain
 
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
you lose right so there's constant
 
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
attrition so it's really trying to get
 
01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:53.219 align:start position:0%
get ahead of that
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
um and as much as a recession isn't a
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
good thing potentially it does bring
 
01:28:59.330 --> 01:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
more people in the door to do some of
 
01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:01.139 align:start position:0%
the work so you know it's it's really
 
01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
hard with the crystal ball to figure out
 
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
the magic formula but I think we have
 
01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
tools now that we didn't have before so
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're making some smaller steps in in
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
towards gains okay
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
um that's something I wanted to touch on
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
in that the the state has enacted and
 
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
you've enacted a recruitment and
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
retention program for for nursing
 
01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
in in various areas and I wonder if you
 
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
could just briefly touch on whether that
 
01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
program so far has been successful and
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
what you're going to need in the future
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
not only once this current crisis ends
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
if it is a current crisis and not an
 
01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
ongoing one but what we're going to what
 
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
sort of resource you would need to
 
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
attract nurses meaning that uh
 
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
they're they're you have two
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
competitions one you're competing with
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
private sector and then you're competing
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
with the overall Nationwide shortage of
 
01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.090 align:start position:0%
with the overall Nationwide shortage of
nurses

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
right so and I think those are real-time
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
challenges I mean the bottom line is
 
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
money right so we really can't we can
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
only compete to a certain extent all
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
right we can't pay what the hospitals
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
are paying we can't do the bonuses like
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing they they do we do a bonus
 
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
they do two bonuses right they may have
 
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
a better benefits package what we have
 
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:17.219 align:start position:0%
is the draw to people to do the work for
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
the department and that you wanted to
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
hear because of the mission-driven work
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
that we do so we do have that and it
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
does does factor into it but we will
 
01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
always be behind those
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
um professions until something shifts in
 
01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
the bigger market and once that shifts I
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
think we'll we'll see a difference but
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
you know to get to to an 82 fill at
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
Hampstead that may change in two weeks
 
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
right so it you know it's hard to get
 
01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
the stability with that right now okay
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
and and you you will see
 
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
um in in our prioritized needs request
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
you as I mentioned earlier
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the Recruitment and Retention
 
01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.209 align:start position:0%
um the Recruitment and Retention
um

01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:58.610 --> 01:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
RSA that that was amended to provide New
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital with the ability to
 
01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
to utilize
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
um you know bonuses and whatnot you will
 
01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
see roughly three mil a little over
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
three million dollars of a prioritized
 
01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
need request in order to to try to
 
01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:13.310 align:start position:0%
need request in order to to try to
Target

01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
Target
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
um new new nurses and and other uh
 
01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
individuals to to come to work for New
 
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital okay uh my last
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
question is going to be on on Medicaid
 
01:31:25.129 --> 01:31:25.139 align:start position:0%
and from from General funds I believe
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at correctly only it it goes
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
from roughly 297 million and 23 up to
 
01:31:35.229 --> 01:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
346 million in fiscal year 25
 
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
and uh if I understand it correctly that
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
we will continue to get the the 6.22
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
until June 30th of 23 June 30th of 23rd
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
of 23 but then we just have to you know
 
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
that the people who are currently on the
 
01:31:52.129 --> 01:31:52.139 align:start position:0%
rolls who at that point will be allowed
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
to be disenrolled
 
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh how much of these numbers reflect
 
01:31:59.810 --> 01:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
the disenrollment is that included here
 
01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
have you included any disenrollment or
 
01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the people you think
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
could be disenrolled or showed up in
 
01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
these numbers right so the um the
 
01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
figures for that are included um there's
 
01:32:13.970 --> 01:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
two prioritized needs one is for chip
 
01:32:16.970 --> 01:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
and one is for standard Medicaid
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
um chip is uh roughly three million
 
01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
dollars standard Medicaid is 25 million
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
dollars it assumes the public health
 
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
emergency ends in October and that would
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
cover the the any of the costs over
 
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
um over our other projections so
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
um I I would expect if if we do get
 
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
indications that the public health
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
emergency will end in April
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
um then I think I think it would be
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate to potentially take a look
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
at what those prioritizing needs are and
 
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
reduce those down
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
um and and that would be sufficient to
 
01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
cover essentially those individuals that
 
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
continue to be enrolled that shouldn't
 
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:56.699 align:start position:0%
necessarily be enrolled
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
um however the the The X Factor in all
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
that is the appeals we don't know how
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
many we're going to get but we do expect
 
01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh the entire process to probably take
 
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
about nine months and there has been a
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
team working on on that distance just so
 
01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:14.699 align:start position:0%
you you both are everyone is aware there
 
01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
has been a team working on that process
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
for about over two years they meet every
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
Friday there's a whole Collective crew
 
01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
of individuals involved in that so the
 
01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:24.260 align:start position:0%
moment we get noticed we are ready to go
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
because again each month that we keep
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
individuals on
 
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
um on the on the role or you know that
 
01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
that we will incur our costs for that we
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
will no longer be compensated for that
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
through that 6.2 percent fmap okay and
 
01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
when do we find out if the Federal
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
Emergency is going to end in April uh at
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
least 60 days in advance so I guess that
 
01:33:49.330 --> 01:33:49.340 align:start position:0%
would put us somewhere around February
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
11th or so maybe February 10th so about
 
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
four days before the budget is due
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
perfect timing right
 
01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you sure
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
um good morning
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up to what James had
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
asked if
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
those going through the appeal process
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
are found
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
um that the appeal is
 
01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
um the disenrollment was correct I'll
 
01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
say it that way
 
01:34:16.129 --> 01:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
um as you drew the Medicaid during that
 
01:34:17.570 --> 01:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
period of time is there an opportunity
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
to recoup
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid at all you know what
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
happens during that sort of appeal
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
process period
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
so at any individual that is is enrolled
 
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
during that time frame the the state
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
um and then I'm going to shift gears
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
just a little bit on the redesign model
 
01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.189 align:start position:0%
just a little bit on the redesign model
for

01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
um the dads 50 dads um
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
does that model include and I'm not sure
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
where you send with this fully funding
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
um all of the clients you have a wait
 
01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
list at all
 
01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
um in any of those areas so so our
 
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs requests and includes
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
fully funding okay that that area yes
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
based on current projection are based on
 
01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
projections as of four months ago
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and and I believe we have provided
 
01:35:12.649 --> 01:35:12.659 align:start position:0%
additional information since then
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
um about potentially decreasing that
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
those figures
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
um as well and we're going to conduct
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
another analysis here soon uh to come up
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
with with the most accurate data
 
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
possible the last
 
01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
um when when I looked at this back after
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
the budget was submitted this is the end
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
of September
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
um we would currently based on updated
 
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
information be able to reduce the
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
prioritizing requests by about 26
 
01:35:40.129 --> 01:35:40.139 align:start position:0%
million dollars John
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
um 50 50 Federal General funds in 24 and
 
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
42 million dollars 50 50 Federal General
 
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
funds in 25. okay and so those dollars
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
are the fully fund is that separate than
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
the that is separate okay the 16 it's
 
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
numbers are close but the 16 million and
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
the 27 million on page 16 at handout
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
that talked about the payment model
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
that's independent of the correct okay
 
01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you
 
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much but before you go
 
01:36:13.729 --> 01:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
this seems to be a day of goodbye so I
 
01:36:17.209 --> 01:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
just would like to uh to add my um the
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
sentiments on on you commissioner uh you
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
you are the commissioner of the largest
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
and most certainly complicated budget
 
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
for sure uh but it's a state agency as I
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
said that does so many things that have
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
major consequences in people's lives and
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
if that wasn't enough within weeks of
 
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
you taking this job covet hit and I
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
think the the New Hampshire's excellent
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
record in covid in which apparently
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
everyone has an opinion on and certainly
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
gave it to you I'm sure
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
um that the record speaks for itself and
 
01:36:53.209 --> 01:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
there was no better person for the job
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
than you and you will be greatly missed
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.649 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:37:11.649 --> 01:37:11.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:56.689 --> 01:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:56.699 --> 01:38:05.709 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:38:05.709 --> 01:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.930 --> 01:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
again Absolutely I'll clean it again
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
good morning and uh for the record I am
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
Ken Merrifield the commissioner of the
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and joined by Deputy
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Rudy Ogden uh the
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
department consists of three divisions
 
01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
Administration which includes
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
department-wide activities like human
 
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
resources finance and I.T the Inspection
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
Division which is tasked with the
 
01:38:34.129 --> 01:38:34.139 align:start position:0%
enforcement of States employment safety
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
rather famously elevator and pressure
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
vessel statutes
 
01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
and the largest division is the worker
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
Compensation Division which is tasked
 
01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
with monitoring the state's work of
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
compensation system and providing a
 
01:38:52.810 --> 01:38:52.820 align:start position:0%
platform for the resolution of disputes
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh in each of the last three fiscal
 
01:38:58.250 --> 01:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
years the Inspection Division has
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
recovered in excess of a million dollars
 
01:39:03.250 --> 01:39:03.260 align:start position:0%
in wages for New Hampshire employees
 
01:39:07.370 --> 01:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
completed uh typically about 500 labor
 
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
inspections completed roughly 10 000
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
boiler and pressure vessel inspections
 
01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
and over 5 000 elevator inspections the
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
division is also proactive training
 
01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
employers every year on employment law
 
01:39:24.669 --> 01:39:24.679 align:start position:0%
to assist them in in compliance matters
 
01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:27.380 align:start position:0%
as a consequence of the Public Health
 
01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
crisis that we've all endured in 2020
 
01:39:33.490 --> 01:39:33.500 align:start position:0%
we've also developed
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
virtual training for employers and plan
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
to continue that offering that service
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
into the future
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
the Workers Compensation Division
 
01:39:47.110 --> 01:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
collects first reports of the injury
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
from employers and insurance carriers on
 
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
the roughly 40
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
000 workplace injuries that occur each
 
01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:56.330 align:start position:0%
000 workplace injuries that occur each
year

01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
um it also schedules uh roughly 1500
 
01:40:06.169 --> 01:40:06.179 align:start position:0%
formal hearings per year due to uh
 
01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:09.380 align:start position:0%
disputes in worker compensation cases
 
01:40:13.689 --> 01:40:13.699 align:start position:0%
and also manages uh unappropriated
 
01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:17.699 align:start position:0%
unbudgeted trust fund Collections and
 
01:40:19.729 --> 01:40:19.739 align:start position:0%
payments of nearly 20 million dollars a
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
year which if you look at our operating
 
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
budget uh is about double the size of
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
the department as a whole
 
01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:28.610 align:start position:0%
the department as a whole
um

01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
while the Department's total
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are funded a hundred
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
percent by agency income uh that revenue
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
is derived through two distinct sources
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
the administration fund and the
 
01:40:44.090 --> 01:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
restricted fund the administration fund
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
is described in RSA 281a 59 and comes
 
01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
from a pro rata assessment of the
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
Department's annual budget for worker
 
01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
compensation activities levied on the
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
worker compensation insurance carriers
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
and self-insured entities in New
 
01:41:04.010 --> 01:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you'll note that about 88
 
01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
percent of our budget request for 2024
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 2024 is represented by that
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
Administration fund the restricted fund
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
however is described in RSA 2731b and it
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
comes from the the sum of all other fees
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
licenses certificates and civil
 
01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
penalties that the department of lab
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
manages the balance of the restricted
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
fund following our expenses the balance
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
of that fund is transferred to the
 
01:41:39.530 --> 01:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
general fund at the conclusion of each
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
the department has reported record
 
01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:47.699 align:start position:0%
revenues to the general fund in each of
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
the last two years exceeding two million
 
01:41:53.330 --> 01:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
dollars in fiscal 21 and 3 million
 
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in fiscal 22.
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
um uh and I would say that you know that
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
there are two sides to that coin yes uh
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
record revenues but also uh
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
exceptionally good uh expense control
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
has led to those um record transfers
 
01:42:14.209 --> 01:42:14.219 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is that self-funded
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
agencies were not required to hit the
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
governor's requested expenditure targets
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
however the labor department has done so
 
01:42:25.729 --> 01:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
in 24 and 25 uh the the governor uh
 
01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
provided an overall efficiency Target of
 
01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh just over 11 million dollars in year
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
one for the labor department
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
representing a three percent uh increase
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
from uh 23 adjusted authorized the
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
adjusted year two target was uh slightly
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
higher about three hundred thousand
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
dollars higher after allowances for
 
01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
um again we met both of those targets
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
with our efficiency budget request
 
01:42:58.609 --> 01:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
and while we've requested no new
 
01:43:01.850 --> 01:43:01.860 align:start position:0%
positions for 24 25 despite the
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
abolition of Aid in the current biennium
 
01:43:08.090 --> 01:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
the governor's targets did allow us to
 
01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
refund all remaining uh full-time
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
positions in the department so we are
 
01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:14.699 align:start position:0%
requesting full funding for all of our
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
all of our department full-time
 
01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.410 align:start position:0%
all of our department full-time
positions

01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
other operational changes that we're
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
requesting in our agency budget include
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
the addition of a class 103 for
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
operational contracts we envision this
 
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
being used for certain Building
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
Maintenance and Repair needs
 
01:43:39.410 --> 01:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
um for a total of 75 000 over the course
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
of the biennium we're also requesting a
 
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
new board expenses class 65 as a
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
companion to House Bill 2 language that
 
01:43:52.129 --> 01:43:52.139 align:start position:0%
we're requesting that would allow us to
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
pay per DM members of a very important
 
01:43:58.970 --> 01:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
administratively attached board that has
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
presented some recruiting and retention
 
01:44:04.209 --> 01:44:04.219 align:start position:0%
problems for us at the department
 
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
we also moved our indirect cost payments
 
01:44:11.169 --> 01:44:11.179 align:start position:0%
line into the administration Division
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
and we boosted the amount of money
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
available for employee training due to
 
01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:18.380 align:start position:0%
concerns that we've had about
 
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
rapid staff turnover we feel that we we
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
need to uh
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
increase the speed with which our new
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
hires are able to be helpful to us we've
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
had been a very stable Department
 
01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
um uh with our staff for many many years
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
but in recent years that has changed
 
01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
dramatically and like a lot of other
 
01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
agencies we've lost a lot of a lot of
 
01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:45.179 align:start position:0%
folks so we need to bring them up to
 
01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
speed faster
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
we do have prioritized needs that are
 
01:44:52.250 --> 01:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
being requested Priority One is about
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
thirty six thousand dollars and is
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
related to administrative Services
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
um and related to retiree Health uh
 
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.219 align:start position:0%
priority two is about a hundred thousand
 
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
dollar request also from administrative
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
Services relative to certain building
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
needs at the Labor Department
 
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
headquarters the Spalding building
 
01:45:16.729 --> 01:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
and priority three is funding in both
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
years of the biennium for uh roughly 130
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
000 from the Department of Information
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
Technology uh due to certain allocated
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh or direct expenses largely associated
 
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
with technology improvements that we're
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
making at the department
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my remarks and we're
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
 
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
have great thank you how many employees
 
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
do you currently have we have the 86
 
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
full-time positions and
 
01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
trying to remember I just ran a query
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday on the number of build I think
 
01:46:02.590 --> 01:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
have these been long standing open
 
01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:06.410 align:start position:0%
have these been long standing open
positions

01:46:06.410 --> 01:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
uh those that were longest standing were
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
abolished in the in the current so that
 
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
was the a positions that were abolished
 
01:46:17.209 --> 01:46:17.219 align:start position:0%
um uh I would say that the rest of those
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
are more frequent fills more recent
 
01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:29.030 align:start position:0%
are more frequent fills more recent
fills

01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:32.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
um can you just talk a little bit again
 
01:46:39.649 --> 01:46:39.659 align:start position:0%
I missed your the 50 000 which was the
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
new contract line did you say that was
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
building related
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah well I'll give you I'll give you a
 
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
perfect example that we're experiencing
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
right now the
 
01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
um the security surveillance
 
01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
surveillance video system that we have
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
in the department is really aged and not
 
01:46:58.440 --> 01:46:59.770 align:start position:0%
in the department is really aged and not
operating

01:46:59.770 --> 01:46:59.780 align:start position:0%
operating
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh uh so we have no video surveillance
 
01:47:05.450 --> 01:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
of the building we want to replace that
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
and and the only place that I can go to
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
I have no contract lines the only place
 
01:47:12.649 --> 01:47:12.659 align:start position:0%
that I can go to is equipment or current
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
expense it seems appropriate for us to
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
have some kind of uh funding for and and
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
we have the space within Target to
 
01:47:23.689 --> 01:47:23.699 align:start position:0%
create a contract line
 
01:47:25.490 --> 01:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
so that I was just trying to understand
 
01:47:26.990 --> 01:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
sort of the difference of what that need
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
would be outside of the general Services
 
01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.410 align:start position:0%
would be outside of the general Services
sure

01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
um budget that provides
 
01:47:33.290 --> 01:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
um some building
 
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
really for you okay thank you sure
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay actually I did have one one more
 
01:47:39.410 --> 01:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
question it's actually a line Automotive
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
to try not to get into this level of
 
01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
detail here but I'm going to here
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
um I believe it is the the pension
 
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
benefit health insurance
 
01:47:53.209 --> 01:47:53.219 align:start position:0%
line and it and it goes from 260
 
01:47:58.490 --> 01:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
000 roughly to uh in fiscal year 22 uh
 
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
and it jumped up to 336
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
000 in 23. and can you tell me which
 
01:48:06.530 --> 01:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
Which accounting unit in class yeah this
 
01:48:08.689 --> 01:48:08.699 align:start position:0%
is this is on page three this is the
 
01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
overall oh in the budget book yeah and
 
01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
it's major operating expenses and it's
 
01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
and I think that's um what you pay to
 
01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
admin services in class 64.
 
01:48:28.250 --> 01:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so so these are figures that
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
are provided to us by admin Services
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
um excuse me
 
01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
do you know the specifics
 
01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:41.699 align:start position:0%
um I know that and
 
01:48:44.570 --> 01:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
some agencies are charged let me back up
 
01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
um the state pays for retiree health
 
01:48:49.490 --> 01:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
insurance agencies that have
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
traditionally been you know
 
01:48:53.450 --> 01:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
self-self-funded type agencies get
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
charged their share of what that retiree
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
health insurance is going to be so those
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
numbers are estimated by the Bureau of
 
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
risk and benefits based on
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
um a percentage of of employees
 
01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
I wonder to
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
um commissioner Rockburn
 
01:49:13.330 --> 01:49:13.340 align:start position:0%
could could experience in Prior years
 
01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:15.659 align:start position:0%
have an impact on that as well because
 
01:49:17.570 --> 01:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
we did have a large number of
 
01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:19.189 align:start position:0%
we did have a large number of
retirements

01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
retirements
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah okay I think that's the answer
 
01:49:23.450 --> 01:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
right there
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite the Department of
 
01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:12.709 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
I just happened to flip the book open
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
and it went right to your page
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that's good or bad but
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
that was that was amazing if I'm seeing
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:29.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me commissioner if you could just
 
01:50:39.770 --> 01:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
turn your microphone on here we go is it
 
01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
on now oh much better thank you
 
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
um uh as you know ba was established in
 
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
2017 uh since we were last here for a a
 
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
budget biennial uh process a lot has
 
01:50:56.090 --> 01:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
changed at the department we have a
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
distinctly different feel here as a
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
result of covet and the programs that
 
01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
we've been involved in in helping the
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
state recover from the economic impacts
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic and we continue to do
 
01:51:10.609 --> 01:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
that kind of work and I think some of
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
the changes and some of the
 
01:51:13.370 --> 01:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that you receive
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
reflected in this budget are really as a
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
result of a lot of those initiatives and
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
strategies so I mean with the specific
 
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
areas that we are seeing this is in some
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
new changes in the way that we operate
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
with our rapid response program and the
 
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
office of Workforce opportunity working
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
with businesses that are are having an
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately difficult time weathering
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and the impacts of that and
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
changing the way that we operate that
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
from a very sort of siled situation and
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
process that was in place previously to
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
a much more integrated process that
 
01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
involves other agencies but also
 
01:51:55.850 --> 01:51:55.860 align:start position:0%
involves other divisions within our
 
01:51:58.250 --> 01:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
department which is creating a good deal
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
of value add in those unfortunate
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
situations and retaining Workforce in
 
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
as we as we see these changes in
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
different air in different industries of
 
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
course we have the office and Broadband
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
initiatives which was initiated with
 
01:52:16.970 --> 01:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
arpa funds and the and the invest New
 
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing program there's just
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
as an aside in those two programs we
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
have a total of six 90 positions that
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
are operating those two programs but as
 
01:52:31.609 --> 01:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
you know sort of in the small agency
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
world that we live within there is a a
 
01:52:36.669 --> 01:52:36.679 align:start position:0%
lot of integrated
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
work that gets done on a policy level
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
between our existing Bea staff and those
 
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
federally funded operations so while
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about arpa obviously
 
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
here today but those are impacts that
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
um we just you know integrate into our
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.250 --> 01:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
um as far as organization we're
 
01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
currently at 7 600 positions uh 72
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
classified foreign classified seven on
 
01:53:07.129 --> 01:53:07.139 align:start position:0%
seven on only seven unfilled vacant
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
positions this does not include the bvs
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
numbers our Bureau of visitor Services
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
01:53:16.570 --> 01:53:16.580 align:start position:0%
um some part-time positions that exist
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
under that
 
01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
umbrella with the rest areas in the
 
01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
welcome welcome centers
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that puts our vacancy rate right now
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
just under 10 percent uh with those
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
seven vacant positions
 
01:53:29.639 --> 01:53:30.410 align:start position:0%
seven vacant positions
um

01:53:30.410 --> 01:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
I would note that um uh for the for the
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
most part those vacant positions are
 
01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.129 align:start position:0%
most part those vacant positions are
vacant

01:53:37.129 --> 01:53:37.139 align:start position:0%
vacant
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
um because we are in the process of
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
reclassifying them uh those are
 
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
positions that we expect to
 
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
um uh get get filled at some point uh in
 
01:53:50.209 --> 01:53:50.219 align:start position:0%
the in the foreseeable future some with
 
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
federal funds uh and otherwise
 
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
but just in terms of our organization we
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
have two primary divisions we have the
 
01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
division of Economic Development and
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
within that division we have teams that
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
work in business Recruitment and
 
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
expansion these are the people that work
 
01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
with businesses that are looking to
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
relocate to New Hampshire or locate to
 
01:54:11.649 --> 01:54:11.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or expand in New Hampshire
 
01:54:13.970 --> 01:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
uh they've been quite busy as you might
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
imagine over the last couple of years we
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
have our business support and technical
 
01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
assistance staff these are organizations
 
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
we commonly refer to as our retention
 
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
team these are individuals who are
 
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
working with businesses that are in New
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and are looking to grow their
 
01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
business in one way or another or
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
looking for assistance with state
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
government or just working with our
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
Economic Development partners and
 
01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
implementation of strategies they're our
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
primary team as it relates to that we
 
01:54:45.169 --> 01:54:45.179 align:start position:0%
also have the office of international
 
01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
Commerce that is responsible for all the
 
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
international relations the state has
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
with our at least from an economic
 
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
standpoint with is you know a lot of
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
Canada but increasingly a lot of
 
01:54:58.609 --> 01:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
operation and interaction in Europe uh
 
01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
and in Asia
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
that that office is not entirely but
 
01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
primarily funded by a federal SBA grants
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh under the step program
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
we have our office of Workforce
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity which is designated State
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
entity to administer the federal
 
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
that we owe programs that it's funds
 
01:55:27.709 --> 01:55:27.719 align:start position:0%
that we cooperate with at the New
 
01:55:30.770 --> 01:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment security and uh and
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
other outside agencies cap agencies to
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
provide job training and support
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
services to adult dislocated adult
 
01:55:40.609 --> 01:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
workers and also to youth in youth
 
01:55:40.619 --> 01:55:41.629 align:start position:0%
workers and also to youth in youth
programming

01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
programming
 
01:55:43.729 --> 01:55:43.739 align:start position:0%
uh we have our procurement technical
 
01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
assistance center which is every state
 
01:55:47.810 --> 01:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
has one of these this is funded by the
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense uh it's largely an
 
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
operation that allows our staff to work
 
01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
with businesses that are looking to do
 
01:55:56.689 --> 01:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
subcontracting work with the federal
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
government usually in a military
 
01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint but increasingly in a much
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
more Broad and a much more broad set of
 
01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.450 align:start position:0%
more Broad and a much more broad set of
instances

01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
instances
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
and then of course we have our within
 
01:56:09.590 --> 01:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
DED is also the invest in h housing team
 
01:56:12.430 --> 01:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
and the Broadband team
 
01:56:15.490 --> 01:56:15.500 align:start position:0%
uh as of this is our first full budget
 
01:56:17.450 --> 01:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
with the office of Planning and
 
01:56:19.310 --> 01:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
Development this was the planning
 
01:56:21.050 --> 01:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
division that was previously at OSI
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
before that
 
01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
um iterations of that became part of the
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
01:56:29.090 --> 01:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
um that staff Works primarily in zoning
 
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
and planning with different communities
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
and uh it is a nice mix and a nice
 
01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
addition to our department we continue
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
to work to integrate that team with our
 
01:56:40.370 --> 01:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
overall operation with our Economic
 
01:56:42.890 --> 01:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
Development and travel and tourism team
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
and then of course we have the division
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
of travel tourism development this is uh
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
the the tourism division that uh its
 
01:56:52.330 --> 01:56:52.340 align:start position:0%
primary function is marketing the state
 
01:56:55.490 --> 01:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh as a tourist destination
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
um we have been
 
01:57:00.649 --> 01:57:00.659 align:start position:0%
um over the last several years on a a
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
real mission to see the work that that
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
operation does integrate much more
 
01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
closely to our overall strategies of
 
01:57:11.689 --> 01:57:11.699 align:start position:0%
recruiting not just tourists to New
 
01:57:14.530 --> 01:57:14.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but Workforce but businesses
 
01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
use students and so on and taking a lot
 
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the Baseline work that we do for
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
tourism and Hospitality marketing and
 
01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
transferring that into a format that we
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
can use for those other instances as
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
well and that has shown some good
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
success in some areas and as a result
 
01:57:33.290 --> 01:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
the marketing component here you know
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
continues to be a major function and
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
priority for the Department
 
01:57:40.609 --> 01:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
and then lastly I would say lastly one
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
of these days I'll start with the Bureau
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
of visitor Services because they are a
 
01:57:46.370 --> 01:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
big part of our operation
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
um they are only operational function uh
 
01:57:53.810 --> 01:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
within ba uh we are under an mou with
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation to manage the 12 welcome
 
01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
centers and safety rest areas around the
 
01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:02.870 align:start position:0%
centers and safety rest areas around the
state

01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
um that has I will be honest been a one
 
01:58:08.089 --> 01:58:08.099 align:start position:0%
of our more challenging components over
 
01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
the last year just because when we did
 
01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
scale back during covid it's been really
 
01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
hard to get that operation back to where
 
01:58:20.089 --> 01:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
it was before covid in terms of Staffing
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
these are not very well paid positions
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
as a general rule
 
01:58:26.689 --> 01:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
um before covert we were operating just
 
01:58:29.570 --> 01:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
within bvs with a staff of around 77
 
01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
individuals a little bit of about
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of those were part-time we're
 
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
down I think now around 38 or 39 and
 
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
employees and the majority of those are
 
01:58:41.450 --> 01:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
full-time employees as it turns out
 
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
right at this point we've been juggling
 
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
operations we used to be open seven days
 
01:58:49.129 --> 01:58:49.139 align:start position:0%
a week 20 you know seven days a week in
 
01:58:52.129 --> 01:58:52.139 align:start position:0%
every one of the 12 welcome centers
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
um at this point where we have the main
 
01:58:56.330 --> 01:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
welcome centers on the border uh those
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
are open the southern ones are open 24
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
hours but some of the others are really
 
01:59:02.930 --> 01:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
difficult to manage because we just
 
01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
don't have the staff we've explored
 
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
because everyone always asks me their
 
01:59:08.450 --> 01:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
relationship with like local Chambers
 
01:59:10.970 --> 01:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
and other things to do there but there
 
01:59:12.410 --> 01:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
are some restrictions to what we can do
 
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
with that regard and we haven't had a
 
01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
lot of success in recruiting a chamber
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
to help with that Staffing those centers
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
to this point and that's not for a lack
 
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
of trying
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
I would say lastly just a couple of the
 
01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
priorities that we have I mentioned the
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
marketing uh we want to continue to
 
01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
obviously make that a focus of the work
 
01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
that we do at the department and
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
transfer that into all the other forms
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
that I had mentioned but at the same
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
time our division of Economic
 
01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
Development we did develop uh just at
 
01:59:43.370 --> 01:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
the in early 2021 the state economic
 
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
recovery and expansion strategy a lot of
 
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
that work in the work of the division of
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
economic development is now in
 
01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
implementing that plan and we've had
 
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
some very good success in uh seeing some
 
01:59:56.930 --> 01:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
changes to the way that the state
 
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
interacts with its Partners on an
 
02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
economic development level and uh and
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
that is a sort of fomenting a good deal
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
of support for our collaborative
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
Economic Development regions which are
 
02:00:08.930 --> 02:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
really an effort to take all of these
 
02:00:11.689 --> 02:00:11.699 align:start position:0%
things that we do within within Bea
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
including tourism including helping
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
potentially maybe with the welcome
 
02:00:18.530 --> 02:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
centers but also primarily with the
 
02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
economic development activity is to have
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
they're a much more Regional focus on
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
the economic recovery strategies that we
 
02:00:28.689 --> 02:00:28.699 align:start position:0%
have in place and to be able to
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
implement those in coordination where we
 
02:00:33.649 --> 02:00:33.659 align:start position:0%
have not done that before so just as a
 
02:00:36.410 --> 02:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
quick example we have had uh you know
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
the sole responsibility for business
 
02:00:42.050 --> 02:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
recruitment in the state at uh at Bea
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
and previously at dread with a staff of
 
02:00:47.209 --> 02:00:47.219 align:start position:0%
two and sometimes three individuals that
 
02:00:50.570 --> 02:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
can be a a heavy load when you're in a
 
02:00:51.890 --> 02:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
time like this where you're seeing
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
continued expansionist activity
 
02:00:56.810 --> 02:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
um we we have never really had
 
02:00:59.149 --> 02:00:59.159 align:start position:0%
relationships with local Chambers or
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
local economic development organizations
 
02:01:05.209 --> 02:01:05.219 align:start position:0%
or municipalities to assist in the work
 
02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
of recruiting businesses and that that's
 
02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
a that's a big lift I mean you've got to
 
02:01:10.729 --> 02:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
involve Workforce training you got to
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
have academic institutions you got to
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
demonstrate long-term commitments and
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
all these sorts of things uh having a
 
02:01:18.649 --> 02:01:18.659 align:start position:0%
regional partner with those has been
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
huge in a real success story for us and
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
my we're continuing to grow those
 
02:01:25.729 --> 02:01:25.739 align:start position:0%
relationships and then of course as I
 
02:01:27.050 --> 02:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned I keep bringing up the housing
 
02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
and Broadband because those are two
 
02:01:30.290 --> 02:01:30.300 align:start position:0%
areas that are just so Central to our
 
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
economic future and to have those within
 
02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
Bea and have those leaching through into
 
02:01:37.609 --> 02:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
all of our other strategies and the work
 
02:01:39.890 --> 02:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
that we're doing really increases the
 
02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
meaning and the value that we're able to
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
bring to employers around the state
 
02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
the very last thing and then I'll stop
 
02:01:50.570 --> 02:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
talking is the uh one of the areas that
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
we have uh I wouldn't say struggled but
 
02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
noticed a need an increasing need
 
02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
particularly with the growth of some of
 
02:01:59.930 --> 02:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
these types of activities and the
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
centralization of a lot of
 
02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
administrative components that have
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
historically been done by division and
 
02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
to try to centralize those into one a a
 
02:02:11.810 --> 02:02:11.820 align:start position:0%
much more efficient way of approaching
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
those between the federal contracts
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
between all of the funds and the
 
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
Staffing and the increase in and changes
 
02:02:20.089 --> 02:02:20.099 align:start position:0%
in Staffing that we've been having and
 
02:02:22.129 --> 02:02:22.139 align:start position:0%
the and and chasing Workforce as
 
02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
everyone else is is really to provide
 
02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
some investment in our the
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
administrative side of Bea when we were
 
02:02:33.169 --> 02:02:33.179 align:start position:0%
established in 2017 we came over from
 
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
dread with basically two individuals who
 
02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
were tasked with being the business the
 
02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
entire business office for the
 
02:02:43.129 --> 02:02:43.139 align:start position:0%
Department we have had some changes in
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
that over the last five years years
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
Rhonda Hensley has just joined us that
 
02:02:50.050 --> 02:02:50.060 align:start position:0%
she's here what three weeks on the job
 
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
uh here at ba and so she's going to be
 
02:02:56.209 --> 02:02:56.219 align:start position:0%
leading that effort but getting a little
 
02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
bit more investment in that side of the
 
02:02:58.990 --> 02:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
house I think is going to help
 
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
manage a lot of these changes that we
 
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
have going on internally so those are
 
02:03:05.330 --> 02:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
really the updates from my standpoint
 
02:03:07.490 --> 02:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer any questions okay
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner I just really
 
02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
have two questions one sort of is a is a
 
02:03:16.270 --> 02:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
broader question that relates to
 
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
revenues actually given the business
 
02:03:21.169 --> 02:03:21.179 align:start position:0%
profits taxes is such a huge component
 
02:03:25.850 --> 02:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
of general fund revenues and uh if you
 
02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
to follow the the economics where you
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
know we've had record near record
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
inflation followed by absolute record uh
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
interest rate Rises that every time this
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
happened in the past in the United
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
States we've had a recession to follow
 
02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:42.109 align:start position:0%
States we've had a recession to follow
how

02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:03:45.370 --> 02:03:45.380 align:start position:0%
uh how well is New Hampshire
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh position to handle say a moderate
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
recession and if you could maybe just
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
talk about the basic
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh economy of New Hampshire and how it
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
may have changed from our last recession
 
02:04:01.629 --> 02:04:01.639 align:start position:0%
in 2007-2008
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh well there's a lot there so
 
02:04:06.109 --> 02:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
um I would say first of all in terms of
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
how we've changed uh New Hampshire is
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
definitely on a trajectory right now uh
 
02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
toward a sort of a more high-tech type
 
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
of economy we have seen
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
um that happening in a multitude of ways
 
02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
you know you look at the energy costs
 
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:04:28.970 --> 02:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
um the commercial rates of providing
 
02:04:32.290 --> 02:04:32.300 align:start position:0%
heat or electricity to
 
02:04:34.570 --> 02:04:34.580 align:start position:0%
highly intense
 
02:04:37.010 --> 02:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
manufacturing operations say like
 
02:04:39.649 --> 02:04:39.659 align:start position:0%
Kitchener Manufacturing in Milford where
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
they melt steel and other you know sort
 
02:04:44.109 --> 02:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
of Legacy
 
02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities like paper
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
mills in the North country or in in the
 
02:04:52.010 --> 02:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
southwest area of the state we've seen
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
those operations start to scale down
 
02:04:57.770 --> 02:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
very significantly not all of them I
 
02:04:58.850 --> 02:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
don't want to put hitchner in that
 
02:05:00.890 --> 02:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
category because they make me I have
 
02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of success but a lot of the
 
02:05:05.209 --> 02:05:05.219 align:start position:0%
heavy industry type of jobs that have
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
been traditionally the center of our
 
02:05:10.030 --> 02:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing industry have started to
 
02:05:13.490 --> 02:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
downsize or just go somewhere else and a
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
lot of that is due to the energy cost
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity not something
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
that is exclusive to New Hampshire it is
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
something that we see throughout the
 
02:05:25.970 --> 02:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
Northeast and so while a lot of people
 
02:05:27.770 --> 02:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
say well that's Doom and Gloom about all
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
of that what they're being replaced with
 
02:05:32.089 --> 02:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
are more advanced manufacturers that
 
02:05:35.450 --> 02:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
have that have probably in a lot of
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
cases better higher paying positions
 
02:05:40.970 --> 02:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
higher paying jobs but have energy use
 
02:05:42.770 --> 02:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
rates that are way that are
 
02:05:45.169 --> 02:05:45.179 align:start position:0%
significantly less and so they're
 
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
finding the workforce that they need
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
sort of within this Tech base and it
 
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
really sort of emanates from
 
02:05:53.209 --> 02:05:53.219 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but we're increasingly
 
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
part of and so we're we're seeing
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
expansion activity in areas like life
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
science in areas like just basic
 
02:06:04.010 --> 02:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
technology or Advanced manufacturing and
 
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
that is a result of the fact that while
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
there are still higher energy costs that
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact that industry quite so
 
02:06:12.050 --> 02:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
much but what they're looking for is a
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
highly qualified Workforce and we have
 
02:06:15.530 --> 02:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire we have one of the
 
02:06:17.330 --> 02:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
most highly qualified workforces in the
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
country we continue to see you know
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
record low unemployment rates we
 
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
continue to hear from businesses of all
 
02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
type whether they're a restaurant or
 
02:06:27.709 --> 02:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
whether they're one of these Advanced
 
02:06:29.330 --> 02:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that they have a need for
 
02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:31.010 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that they have a need for
staff

02:06:31.010 --> 02:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
um we when we look at all of these
 
02:06:34.070 --> 02:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
things we don't look at them from the
 
02:06:35.689 --> 02:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
standpoint as what within the political
 
02:06:38.089 --> 02:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
borders of New Hampshire and what what
 
02:06:40.070 --> 02:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
do we have to operate with exclusively
 
02:06:42.109 --> 02:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
we are all jammed in here together up
 
02:06:44.030 --> 02:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
here in the Northeast in New England so
 
02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people and we lose some
 
02:06:48.169 --> 02:06:48.179 align:start position:0%
people today to Massachusetts in terms
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
of employment we also have a large
 
02:06:51.050 --> 02:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
number of people who come to New
 
02:06:52.850 --> 02:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that number is increasing
 
02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:54.229 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that number is increasing
so

02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:55.910 --> 02:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
um I would say that's a big change that
 
02:06:59.629 --> 02:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
we've seen over the last two years it's
 
02:07:01.010 --> 02:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
been a trend that was before that but
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to see that grow uh in
 
02:07:04.609 --> 02:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
terms of how well is New Hampshire
 
02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
positioned to be able to handle this I
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
think that the underlying employer-based
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
private sector uh types of businesses
 
02:07:13.629 --> 02:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
are larger employers
 
02:07:16.910 --> 02:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
are in a good position I think we're the
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
more difficult Industries right now
 
02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
continue to be Healthcare and
 
02:07:23.570 --> 02:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
hospitality and those are two obviously
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
Central components particularly in rural
 
02:07:27.410 --> 02:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
communities when you look at the impact
 
02:07:29.450 --> 02:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
of a local small hospital to a town like
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
Littleton or a town like uh Berlin with
 
02:07:34.729 --> 02:07:34.739 align:start position:0%
androscogen or even Lebanon and Hanover
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
area with Dartmouth Hitchcock the
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
ability to have those high-paying jobs
 
02:07:40.490 --> 02:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
yes you need health care right you need
 
02:07:42.649 --> 02:07:42.659 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide those services but
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
these are some of the highest paying
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
jobs in those rural communities so
 
02:07:48.649 --> 02:07:48.659 align:start position:0%
Health Care is critical in Hospitality
 
02:07:50.810 --> 02:07:50.820 align:start position:0%
of course I mean tourism continues to
 
02:07:54.189 --> 02:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
remain not just the second largest
 
02:07:56.570 --> 02:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
industry in our state
 
02:07:59.089 --> 02:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
it also is I it's the tip of the spear
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
for everything and you go around and I
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
talk to groups all the time and you say
 
02:08:05.450 --> 02:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
how many of you are in Hampshire because
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
someone in your background in your
 
02:08:10.129 --> 02:08:10.139 align:start position:0%
family background came here on vacation
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
and you get two-thirds of the room raise
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
their hand right so that continues to be
 
02:08:18.050 --> 02:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
a dynamic that we live and die by so if
 
02:08:19.850 --> 02:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
we have a tourism industry that is not
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
supported and is not able to translate
 
02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
um sort of that weekend experience into
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
a long-term open a business long-term
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know join a company in New Hampshire
 
02:08:35.089 --> 02:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
or even work remotely
 
02:08:37.370 --> 02:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
um uh you know we people who are working
 
02:08:39.229 --> 02:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
remotely into other areas not just
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
Boston but San Francisco and New York
 
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
our third largest tech employer in New
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is Facebook we don't have a
 
02:08:48.169 --> 02:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
Facebook facility anywhere in New
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but these are people who are
 
02:08:51.169 --> 02:08:51.179 align:start position:0%
working remotely and they're living in
 
02:08:53.810 --> 02:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
rural communities and they're you know
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
participating in their economy there in
 
02:08:58.729 --> 02:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
a good way and you know tie back to
 
02:09:00.410 --> 02:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
broadband there right so we need to be
 
02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
able to have the services available if
 
02:09:04.250 --> 02:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'm an infrastructure standpoint so the
 
02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
Investments that we've made the
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
Investments that we've been making in
 
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
02:09:11.209 --> 02:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
in our Economic Development
 
02:09:13.010 --> 02:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and providing a system
 
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
that's much more sustainable to support
 
02:09:18.169 --> 02:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
businesses as we go forward as is in
 
02:09:20.570 --> 02:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
place and it's continuing to grow and we
 
02:09:22.189 --> 02:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
have I think a good sense of where we
 
02:09:23.810 --> 02:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
want to make those Investments coming
 
02:09:25.729 --> 02:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
forward but with housing and broadband
 
02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
and some of these other Investments that
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
have been made we're in as good of a
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
position as anyone in competition with
 
02:09:32.510 --> 02:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
other states
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and the second time in a
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
row I'm going to ask for a line item
 
02:09:39.169 --> 02:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
um see if I can find it here real quick
 
02:09:42.770 --> 02:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
this one if you have your budget it's on
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what page this is on page
 
02:09:48.050 --> 02:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
five and it's it's a contracted
 
02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:49.310 align:start position:0%
five and it's it's a contracted
expenditures

02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
02:09:53.810 --> 02:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
and they go from roughly 3.968 million
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
in 23 up to 11.5 million in 25 and I
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:10:12.169 --> 02:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
the jump was so significant that I had
 
02:10:12.179 --> 02:10:23.209 align:start position:0%
the jump was so significant that I had
to

02:10:23.209 --> 02:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:23.219 --> 02:10:33.850 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

02:10:33.850 --> 02:10:33.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:36.530 align:start position:0%
so I think
um

02:10:36.530 --> 02:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:40.729 --> 02:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
a good portion of that is some of the
 
02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
changes that we have made and I'd have
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
to look at some of the other accounting
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
units to be sure but we've made some
 
02:10:49.250 --> 02:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
changes in our office of Workforce
 
02:10:50.570 --> 02:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity and the way that that's
 
02:10:52.970 --> 02:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
funded uh and the way that we interact
 
02:10:54.550 --> 02:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire employment security
 
02:10:57.770 --> 02:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
so there's been some
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
um uh update in the in in who is
 
02:11:02.930 --> 02:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
administering those programs so I think
 
02:11:05.810 --> 02:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
that's the bulk of it I think that uh in
 
02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:07.250 align:start position:0%
that's the bulk of it I think that uh in
addition

02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
addition
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
um we have a request under I believe the
 
02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
division of economic development for
 
02:11:15.649 --> 02:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
some increase in contractual uh
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
assistance going forward and that will
 
02:11:20.450 --> 02:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
be to continue to implement help us
 
02:11:23.089 --> 02:11:23.099 align:start position:0%
Implement strategies as it relates to
 
02:11:24.530 --> 02:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
the economic recovery and expansion
 
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
strategy so I I don't have the exact
 
02:11:31.129 --> 02:11:31.139 align:start position:0%
answer as to what that is we can provide
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
that for you but I do believe that it's
 
02:11:34.970 --> 02:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
related to our office of Workforce
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity changes and then some of the
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
requests that we've made for the
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
division of Economic Development great
 
02:11:46.729 --> 02:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
we just have more of a um it's a general
 
02:11:50.570 --> 02:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
question um believe it was yesterday the
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
university system was talking about one
 
02:11:54.890 --> 02:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
of the programs that they are running
 
02:11:56.450 --> 02:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
and they're looking to expand is
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
building Partnerships with students and
 
02:12:00.669 --> 02:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
private businesses in terms of
 
02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
internships trying to keep students in
 
02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and because you have such
 
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
a connection with businesses especially
 
02:12:09.649 --> 02:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
new ones coming in do they work directly
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
with your office okay oh yeah yeah I
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
mean very closely we work with
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
universities in each of the individual
 
02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
universities on exactly that subject I
 
02:12:21.530 --> 02:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
just diploma State yesterday so I refer
 
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
to it as the triangle it is definitely
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
part of our major strategic approach to
 
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
grow that qualified Workforce the
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
triangle being the state our academic
 
02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
institutions and employers and you know
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
one of our strategies to really to
 
02:12:37.850 --> 02:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
normalize that relationship so it's not
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
just like hey we need a few interns
 
02:12:42.109 --> 02:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
let's call you know Jim over at UNH and
 
02:12:44.209 --> 02:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
get a few we want to normalize those
 
02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
relationships so it's a much better
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
relay relationship and that we're seeing
 
02:12:49.729 --> 02:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
some success there yeah one of their um
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
additional requests was in the you know
 
02:12:54.589 --> 02:12:54.599 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and Keen area was to trying to
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
build the program
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:16.609 --> 02:13:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite environmental
 
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
services for their testimony
 
02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:35.350 align:start position:0%
services for their testimony
foreign

02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.209 --> 02:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
good morning uh again for the record my
 
02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
name is uh Bob Scott I'm commissioner
 
02:13:40.609 --> 02:13:40.619 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Environmental
 
02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
Services and uh thankfully for you I
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
brought the brains of our outfit uh Sue
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
Carlson our chief operating officer so
 
02:13:50.510 --> 02:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh as you'll see uh in the handout
 
02:13:52.609 --> 02:13:52.619 align:start position:0%
that's go that's coming your way
 
02:13:52.619 --> 02:13:53.209 align:start position:0%
that's go that's coming your way
um

02:13:53.209 --> 02:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:59.209 --> 02:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
the department has a fairly wide and uh
 
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh diverse uh set of responsibilities
 
02:14:04.729 --> 02:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
and uh you know notionally we're divided
 
02:14:07.970 --> 02:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
under four uh really three divisions and
 
02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
then we we internally really consider
 
02:14:11.330 --> 02:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner's Office a division
 
02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:13.069 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner's Office a division
also

02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:14:15.770 --> 02:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and I'll highlight uh some of the
 
02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
programs that we do but I but I'll start
 
02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
with we in addition to Haze and drive we
 
02:14:22.510 --> 02:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
have an office at peas
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh what made many people may not be
 
02:14:27.050 --> 02:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
aware of is we do have a small Fleet of
 
02:14:29.810 --> 02:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
watercraft that we in in booming
 
02:14:33.169 --> 02:14:33.179 align:start position:0%
material uh that we operate around Great
 
02:14:36.530 --> 02:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
Bay uh especially uh as an oil supply
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
response uh
 
02:14:41.450 --> 02:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh mechanism we have a coastal program
 
02:14:43.490 --> 02:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
there and we'll talk a little bit later
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
about our shellfish program so we have a
 
02:14:47.810 --> 02:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
selfish monitoring program that that
 
02:14:51.050 --> 02:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
budding industry really relies on uh
 
02:14:54.589 --> 02:14:54.599 align:start position:0%
also in Franklin and Laconia we have the
 
02:14:57.890 --> 02:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
warrensaki River Basin which is we we I
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
think we're unique in the country for
 
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
such an agency as ours that we own and
 
02:15:04.850 --> 02:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
operate a wastewater treatment facility
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
that serves 10 communities in The Lakes
 
02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
Region so that's rather unique uh in
 
02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
that respect we also are responsible for
 
02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
the safety of the 200
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
2615 dams in the State uh 274 of those
 
02:15:22.970 --> 02:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
are state-owned and they're in various
 
02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
levels of
 
02:15:27.169 --> 02:15:27.179 align:start position:0%
um I was going to say disrepair but I
 
02:15:28.689 --> 02:15:28.699 align:start position:0%
don't want to be too alarmist but
 
02:15:31.970 --> 02:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
there's a constant need to maintain uh
 
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
dams and other infrastructure
 
02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
similarly another program that may not
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
be obvious that the department would
 
02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
have is a spools the Pools and Spa
 
02:15:44.209 --> 02:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
program and we'll talk about a position
 
02:15:49.149 --> 02:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
later for that uh it and back in 2018
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
you know into the first year of my 10
 
02:15:54.050 --> 02:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
years commissioner uh we unfortunately
 
02:15:56.089 --> 02:15:56.099 align:start position:0%
had in Hampton we had an unregistered
 
02:15:56.099 --> 02:15:57.229 align:start position:0%
had in Hampton we had an unregistered
Spa

02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
Spa
 
02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh cause uh Legionella or uh issue with
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
that impacted 15 people in Hampton uh
 
02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
including a couple of deaths so that
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
that really was the impetus to have us
 
02:16:12.050 --> 02:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
revamp that program uh so we'll talk
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
about that uh when we get to prioritize
 
02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:14.950 align:start position:0%
about that uh when we get to prioritize
needs

02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
in addition to our our bread and butter
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know hazardous waste and Water
 
02:16:23.689 --> 02:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
Resource issues uh air issues air
 
02:16:26.810 --> 02:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
pollution issues uh we are also again
 
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
maybe not as obvious to folks a big part
 
02:16:32.990 --> 02:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
of our annual budget is usually uh
 
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
different loans and Grant programs that
 
02:16:36.770 --> 02:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
go out to the community so I've been
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner since 2017. we did a quick
 
02:16:42.530 --> 02:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
back of the envelope uh during that time
 
02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
frame over 800 million dollars has gone
 
02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
to local communities for water and
 
02:16:50.570 --> 02:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
wastewater infrastructure and they're
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
really depended on that so that's a
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
large that kind of pass-through is a
 
02:16:56.089 --> 02:16:56.099 align:start position:0%
large large part of our budget but it's
 
02:16:57.889 --> 02:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
also an important part of our workload
 
02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
so those those are not just here's a
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
lump sum go do the what you want they
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
all have federal and state requirements
 
02:17:07.129 --> 02:17:07.139 align:start position:0%
obviously for for auditing and by and
 
02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
large they are done on a reimbursement
 
02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:11.099 align:start position:0%
basis so we validate that the
 
02:17:12.969 --> 02:17:12.979 align:start position:0%
engineering work has been done properly
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it's a valid uh request to be paid
 
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh that meets the criteria so as you may
 
02:17:22.610 --> 02:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
and those are 20-year loans by and large
 
02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
so for the loan so as you may imagine
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
those are the gift that keeps on giving
 
02:17:29.089 --> 02:17:29.099 align:start position:0%
so to speak as far as workload uh is
 
02:17:30.770 --> 02:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
having said that they're vital to the
 
02:17:32.690 --> 02:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
communities and we view that as an
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
important part of our mission uh before
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
I leave this this slide number two
 
02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:39.230 align:start position:0%
I leave this this slide number two
um

02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
you see we have a total of 478 full-time
 
02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
employees currently we have a 61 that's
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
excuse me hopefully not percent uh 61 uh
 
02:17:52.570 --> 02:17:52.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:56.209 --> 02:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
I just go home if that was the case uh
 
02:17:58.730 --> 02:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
so so you know again so we have
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
engineers and scientists and uh we're we
 
02:18:05.389 --> 02:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh if we go to the next slide I'll
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
continue on that that theme we do have a
 
02:18:10.009 --> 02:18:10.019 align:start position:0%
great Mission which is uh protecting
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
Public Health in the environment and you
 
02:18:15.469 --> 02:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
know oh I think that's why we only have
 
02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
the 13 vacancy rate because because to
 
02:18:20.509 --> 02:18:20.519 align:start position:0%
be blunt we're trying to compete with
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
industry for the engineers and
 
02:18:25.129 --> 02:18:25.139 align:start position:0%
scientists that are out there a lot of
 
02:18:26.690 --> 02:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
people come because of the mission so
 
02:18:29.230 --> 02:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
we're thankful for that
 
02:18:32.450 --> 02:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
so going to slide four again some of the
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
core functions I've kind of mentioned
 
02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
already so I won't labor on that uh but
 
02:18:39.530 --> 02:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
but again anywhere things that have
 
02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
taken up a lot of time of late are uh
 
02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminants uh in in water uh
 
02:18:48.410 --> 02:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
the the the Good News by and large I
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
think the the environment has gotten
 
02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
cleaner uh due to a lot of activities in
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
the past decades uh the bad news I
 
02:19:00.049 --> 02:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
suppose is as science gets better we're
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:07.790 --> 02:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
levels that
 
02:19:10.370 --> 02:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
um there are contaminants that we
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
weren't aware of that are causing health
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
issues so so the so the the goal Booth
 
02:19:17.150 --> 02:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
post if you will for the agency and and
 
02:19:19.549 --> 02:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
public health keeps moving and due to
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
science changing but that's I think
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
inevitable uh moving to slide five
 
02:19:28.669 --> 02:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh again as I
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
kind of alluded so the contamination is
 
02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
a large part of addressing that is uh
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
we've been very active in that I've
 
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
already mentioned we do a lot of work uh
 
02:19:40.129 --> 02:19:40.139 align:start position:0%
on infrastructure uh drinking water
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
clean water dams uh storm water uh and
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
and part of that is all data management
 
02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
uh to make us more efficient so annually
 
02:19:55.130 --> 02:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
on average uh we we do about uh 21
 
02:19:58.130 --> 02:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
000 uh permit actions and conduct over
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
16 000 inspections uh with 93 different
 
02:20:04.969 --> 02:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
type of permits managing over 115
 
02:20:07.370 --> 02:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
federal grants and 40 more than 40
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds and and in excess of 35
 
02:20:14.450 --> 02:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
state laws I will say parenthetically it
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
seems our our responsibility emission
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
grows with every legislative session
 
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
since I've been here you know we
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
typically go in for looking for ways to
 
02:20:25.969 --> 02:20:25.979 align:start position:0%
streamline and this is not again I think
 
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
it's more the goal post thing I was just
 
02:20:29.570 --> 02:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
talking about but every year the
 
02:20:30.770 --> 02:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
legislature gives us more
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so that's another area
 
02:20:34.730 --> 02:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
where the goal post post keeps moving
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
moving for us but again I think it's
 
02:20:38.929 --> 02:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
probably necessary but having all those
 
02:20:40.969 --> 02:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
those actions I has talked about that
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
makes data management even more
 
02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
important uh for us and and again you'll
 
02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
see that in a in our efficiency budget
 
02:20:48.660 --> 02:20:49.429 align:start position:0%
see that in a in our efficiency budget
um

02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
moving to slide number six uh again our
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget is uh roughly 271
 
02:20:58.190 --> 02:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars so that's obviously
 
02:21:02.090 --> 02:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
within the the three percent goal uh it
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
does represent an eight percent increase
 
02:21:07.490 --> 02:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
over the 23 fiscal year 23 primarily in
 
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
the area again of uh contracts and Loans
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
I'll talk more about that we also within
 
02:21:16.849 --> 02:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
that we've we have 14 new staff uh
 
02:21:20.410 --> 02:21:20.420 align:start position:0%
broken up in areas of
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
programmatic work uh administrative work
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
and Technical staff so what what are we
 
02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
talking about uh I mentioned our pools
 
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
and spots program already so we would
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
add we're looking at adding a position
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
uh due to the new requirements uh that
 
02:21:37.849 --> 02:21:37.859 align:start position:0%
again were put forth after that event in
 
02:21:42.290 --> 02:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
2018. uh we we have solid program staff
 
02:21:45.130 --> 02:21:45.140 align:start position:0%
for solid waste emerging contaminants uh
 
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
asbestos in our state revolving Loan
 
02:21:50.809 --> 02:21:50.819 align:start position:0%
Fund programs uh they're all related in
 
02:21:52.969 --> 02:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
some fast and ongoing increases in
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
federal funding and in response to our
 
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
contaminant issues our emerging
 
02:21:57.240 --> 02:21:58.790 align:start position:0%
contaminant issues our emerging
contaminants

02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
02:21:58.800 --> 02:21:59.950 align:start position:0%
contaminants
um

02:21:59.950 --> 02:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
related to that I already mentioned the
 
02:22:04.490 --> 02:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
importance of data management uh so the
 
02:22:06.290 --> 02:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
technical staff references it was
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
shorthand for our business system the
 
02:22:11.570 --> 02:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
analysts so we have uh different
 
02:22:14.929 --> 02:22:14.939 align:start position:0%
analysts uh in our budget uh to help us
 
02:22:17.469 --> 02:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
at different levels within the agency
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh and again that's so far that's proven
 
02:22:23.150 --> 02:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
we already have some embedded in our
 
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
obviously you work very closely with
 
02:22:26.929 --> 02:22:26.939 align:start position:0%
doit but we have some embedded within
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
our own programs to help facilitate
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
doit's work with us uh and that's really
 
02:22:34.610 --> 02:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
paid dividends so that's that's why we
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
think we need to continue for that
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
so moving to the next slide slide seven
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
is uh again Sue Carlson was kind enough
 
02:22:45.650 --> 02:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
to kind of give you a couple variations
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
to to give you an idea of where our
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
brexit lies uh really the the take home
 
02:22:56.110 --> 02:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
least in my mind to this is uh we're
 
02:22:59.630 --> 02:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
primarily funded out of between fees and
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure uh different funds
 
02:23:04.969 --> 02:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
that's 94 of our funding only six
 
02:23:07.010 --> 02:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
percent of our total budget is in uh
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
02:23:11.809 --> 02:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
um so you know moving fairly quickly for
 
02:23:13.010 --> 02:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
you obviously you can answer any
 
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
questions I recognize we're the last on
 
02:23:16.610 --> 02:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
the list here so I know you saved the
 
02:23:20.570 --> 02:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
best for last so uh I the next slide
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
again uh is just breaking it out a
 
02:23:25.849 --> 02:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
little bit different uh and again you
 
02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
see the the different loan programs
 
02:23:31.370 --> 02:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
especially are a big part of what we do
 
02:23:32.929 --> 02:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
whether it's I already mentioned water
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we do Bridal fields
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
we also again the pfas emerging
 
02:23:40.849 --> 02:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
containment issue contaminant issue is
 
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
also a lot of what we do so that's 68 of
 
02:23:47.450 --> 02:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
our budget is uh is passed through to
 
02:23:48.889 --> 02:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
the local communities
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
so moving to the next slide slide number
 
02:23:53.630 --> 02:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
nine again just a different different
 
02:23:57.410 --> 02:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
breakout that Sue's provided for us uh
 
02:24:01.010 --> 02:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
again this is by division uh by and
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
large you'll see uh the Water Division
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
accounts for if roughly 50 percent of
 
02:24:08.210 --> 02:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
our operating budget I already mentioned
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
those pass-throughs those those major
 
02:24:12.670 --> 02:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
programs are all in our Water Division
 
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
and they also probably not surprisingly
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
account for 53 percent of our staffing
 
02:24:19.849 --> 02:24:19.859 align:start position:0%
as well uh followed by the waste
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
management Division and air Division and
 
02:24:24.290 --> 02:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
then the the commissioner's office
 
02:24:27.950 --> 02:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
so our next slide is uh analysis by cost
 
02:24:31.370 --> 02:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh category so
 
02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:31.969 align:start position:0%
uh category so
um

02:24:31.969 --> 02:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
you know this is again our efficiency
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
budget and I do want to focus a bit on
 
02:24:38.450 --> 02:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs uh as you can see
 
02:24:41.090 --> 02:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh there's an overall increase of uh
 
02:24:44.929 --> 02:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
over 19 million from 23 to 24. uh nearly
 
02:24:47.570 --> 02:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
all the the increases again is in loans
 
02:24:48.889 --> 02:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
and contracts
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh 10 million of that is in our clean
 
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
water when we say clean water uh it's
 
02:24:57.050 --> 02:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
really jargon for the the
 
02:24:59.030 --> 02:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
environmentally folks so clean why do
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
you think is something you drink it's no
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's actually waste water so drinking
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
water is something you should drink
 
02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
um so clean water uh repayments uh are
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
are showing at 10 million dollars so why
 
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
is that so uh I'll talk about for our
 
02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs the infrastructure
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
bill that Congress did is funneling a
 
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
lot of money I mentioned the 800 million
 
02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
that since 2017 we've used this mostly
 
02:25:29.090 --> 02:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
State revolving loan funds uh those
 
02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
funds are increasing significantly under
 
02:25:32.809 --> 02:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure bill so over the next
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
five years we're getting a a big
 
02:25:37.730 --> 02:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
increase in in those amounts which is
 
02:25:41.090 --> 02:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
very exciting uh on top of that uh the
 
02:25:42.770 --> 02:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
arpa money which I'm sure you're all
 
02:25:45.170 --> 02:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
familiar with uh there was a car voter
 
02:25:47.450 --> 02:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
and Opera allowing those funds that went
 
02:25:49.490 --> 02:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
to the at least the state government to
 
02:25:50.809 --> 02:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
be used for water and wastewater
 
02:25:53.210 --> 02:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as well so we've been
 
02:25:55.010 --> 02:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
very fortunate as a state because I
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
think because the the are the way we
 
02:25:59.870 --> 02:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
were set up and uh we already had a
 
02:26:03.650 --> 02:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
surplus going into the the pandemic uh
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
we were able to you know I'm thankful
 
02:26:08.570 --> 02:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
for move 185 million dollars into of
 
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
arpa funds to address
 
02:26:13.490 --> 02:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh Drinking Water waste water storm
 
02:26:16.190 --> 02:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
water and dams uh much needed
 
02:26:18.590 --> 02:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure work we took that money
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
and we leveraged that against the
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
traditional State revolving funds and we
 
02:26:26.690 --> 02:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
were able to front load a fair amount of
 
02:26:29.389 --> 02:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
work that's now going through so that
 
02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
that increase is really a recognition of
 
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
let's get that money out let's leverage
 
02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
what we have and we have this
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure money coming on top of
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
that so again it's a great uh
 
02:26:42.770 --> 02:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
a great opportunity for the state and
 
02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
we're we're I I almost work every day
 
02:26:47.389 --> 02:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
with municipalities to make sure that
 
02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
they get their story out so they can
 
02:26:51.290 --> 02:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
accept this monies at town meeting
 
02:26:53.690 --> 02:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
because that's that's part of what many
 
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
of them have to do uh having said that
 
02:26:58.130 --> 02:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh Federal loans also were increased by
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh one million dollars for the the
 
02:27:02.090 --> 02:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
drinking water side of the srf uh from
 
02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
23 to 24. uh there's a you know so a
 
02:27:07.849 --> 02:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
decrease in loans for the emerging
 
02:27:10.190 --> 02:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
contaminant fund which is our pfas Loan
 
02:27:14.450 --> 02:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
Fund uh a couple bienniums ago uh we
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
were allocated uh Bond approval for up
 
02:27:19.969 --> 02:27:19.979 align:start position:0%
to 50 million for pfas loans to address
 
02:27:22.490 --> 02:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
contamination in the state for drinking
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
water uh the the reason why that showing
 
02:27:27.770 --> 02:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
a decrease is because we're coming up to
 
02:27:30.170 --> 02:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
that that loan cap of 50 million so we
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
aren't able to do as much as we had done
 
02:27:35.450 --> 02:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
in past years uh we're also seeing a
 
02:27:37.370 --> 02:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
contract increase primarily in our
 
02:27:39.849 --> 02:27:39.859 align:start position:0%
federal Superfund program uh
 
02:27:43.490 --> 02:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
let's see uh that's 6.6 million of
 
02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
federal funds that were able to to
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
allocate and the drinking water
 
02:27:50.990 --> 02:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund uh which was
 
02:27:54.110 --> 02:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
came through the legislature after uh
 
02:27:56.929 --> 02:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
mtbe monies from contamination came to
 
02:28:00.110 --> 02:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
the state uh there's an increase for
 
02:28:02.929 --> 02:28:02.939 align:start position:0%
contract work for 1.6 million for
 
02:28:05.870 --> 02:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
analytical work to help those impacted
 
02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
Wells and communities and finally for
 
02:28:12.050 --> 02:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits for 25 so you'll
 
02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
see this pretty much across the board uh
 
02:28:17.389 --> 02:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
you'll see those increases are a result
 
02:28:19.849 --> 02:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
of the step increases and increases in
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
health benefit premiums
 
02:28:29.570 --> 02:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
page 11 uh is again uh is an analysis
 
02:28:31.130 --> 02:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
showing our efficiency budget by
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
category uh and again you'll see
 
02:28:35.570 --> 02:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
increases in as I just mentioned in
 
02:28:39.889 --> 02:28:39.899 align:start position:0%
federal funds uh primarily due to the
 
02:28:43.130 --> 02:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
super fund contracts uh funding you'll
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
see increases uh again the 10 million I
 
02:28:49.130 --> 02:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
mentioned for srf repayment loans uh in
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
the 1.6 for drinking water uh
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
trust fund for analyticals as I
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned so really what I wanted to
 
02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
talk about after all that was the
 
02:29:00.190 --> 02:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
prioritize needs
 
02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
so again if I've alluded to for the the
 
02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
federal infrastructure bill
 
02:29:09.770 --> 02:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh that much of that was focused on uh
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
water infrastructure generally uh so
 
02:29:15.290 --> 02:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
we're seeing quite a plus up and uh so a
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
lot of what you're seeing is is is is is
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
related to that but generally and I'll
 
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
go through each one real quickly is uh
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
we are asking for a new position for
 
02:29:28.610 --> 02:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
um database work uh to help us as I
 
02:29:31.130 --> 02:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
mentioned for that critical work uh
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
State a grant increase uh for the
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
Wastewater program I'll talk to that
 
02:29:38.750 --> 02:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
that is not srf that's a state program
 
02:29:42.290 --> 02:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
that the legislature uh likes to fund
 
02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
um and then uh we'll talk about uh
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
additional increase for the
 
02:29:49.849 --> 02:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee River Basin as I mentioned
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh and for federal funds the
 
02:29:55.130 --> 02:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
infrastructure money that I felt that
 
02:29:58.330 --> 02:29:58.340 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned so moving to slide 13.
 
02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh ranked by our priority priorities uh
 
02:30:04.730 --> 02:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
is our prioritized needs so again the
 
02:30:06.889 --> 02:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
first as I mentioned is our new business
 
02:30:09.950 --> 02:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
systems analyst to help with our our
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
database work so we are our constituents
 
02:30:14.330 --> 02:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
are very
 
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
used to and dependent and demanding now
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
that we have an online presence that
 
02:30:20.690 --> 02:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
they can get at environmental data
 
02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
permitting information uh online that's
 
02:30:26.929 --> 02:30:26.939 align:start position:0%
that's a trend that's not going away uh
 
02:30:30.349 --> 02:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
and uh our our public-facing side of
 
02:30:32.809 --> 02:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
that we call it the One-Stop the intent
 
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
is here's your one stop to to find your
 
02:30:37.849 --> 02:30:37.859 align:start position:0%
information uh that's been an ongoing
 
02:30:40.610 --> 02:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
Evolution over decades and that's a
 
02:30:42.530 --> 02:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
continuous thing that needs needs
 
02:30:44.570 --> 02:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
upgrading and approving uh improving so
 
02:30:47.570 --> 02:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
we need help on that uh we also are
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
found found that we work very closely
 
02:30:52.130 --> 02:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
with the environmental Bureau at the
 
02:30:55.730 --> 02:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and uh we we want
 
02:30:58.730 --> 02:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
to fund a a new position over there so
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see an increase based on that and
 
02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
again that's a lot of that's due to
 
02:31:04.969 --> 02:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
activity for an example as I mentioned
 
02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
pfas uh we're in litigation federally
 
02:31:11.450 --> 02:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
with 3m the manufacturers of that the
 
02:31:14.270 --> 02:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
the firefighting foam folks that that
 
02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
those are just examples but those are
 
02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
additional things that the Department of
 
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
Justice attorneys never had to address
 
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
before uh and and they need that time
 
02:31:26.090 --> 02:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
and and Staffing to do that uh on the
 
02:31:27.889 --> 02:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
positive side for
 
02:31:32.090 --> 02:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
um pcbs we've they were able to get a 25
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
million dollar settlement in the State
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know with the general fund uh
 
02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
with Monsanto so that's the type of work
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
they've been doing but they need the
 
02:31:43.790 --> 02:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
staff to do that and and we want to help
 
02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
increase that the state air permit
 
02:31:49.130 --> 02:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
program our third prioritized needs um
 
02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh We've we are I'll say a couple things
 
02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
so that's a fee program uh but
 
02:31:56.870 --> 02:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
especially as the economy we think we're
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
about to go into we're loath to increase
 
02:32:02.929 --> 02:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
fees Most states uh augment with General
 
02:32:07.070 --> 02:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
funds uh this is and historically in the
 
02:32:09.650 --> 02:32:09.660 align:start position:0%
past uh bioms at least since I've been
 
02:32:13.010 --> 02:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
here uh this the state has been doing
 
02:32:17.809 --> 02:32:17.819 align:start position:0%
that so this is intended to uh offset uh
 
02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
what would otherwise be an increase to
 
02:32:22.570 --> 02:32:22.580 align:start position:0%
to mission-based fees for that program
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh priority needs number four is uh we
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
have under statute we have what's called
 
02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
an in-stream flow program for for Rivers
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh that requires certain studies to be
 
02:32:37.969 --> 02:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
done and the intent of that is is and
 
02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
is probably very timely we're in
 
02:32:44.690 --> 02:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
probably likely unfortunately next year
 
02:32:46.969 --> 02:32:46.979 align:start position:0%
to go into year four of severe drought
 
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
in different parts of the state so the
 
02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
the intent of that program is to manage
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
the the the use and and impacts of uh
 
02:32:59.630 --> 02:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
water usage uh in our in our Rivers so
 
02:33:02.809 --> 02:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
this this would allow us to a meet this
 
02:33:06.349 --> 02:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
statute uh but also to do it in a more
 
02:33:08.510 --> 02:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
timely manner uh I think that the
 
02:33:10.250 --> 02:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
current rate will maybe get through all
 
02:33:13.130 --> 02:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
the rivers in 40 years or so which is I
 
02:33:14.510 --> 02:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
don't think really the intent of the
 
02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:16.370 align:start position:0%
don't think really the intent of the
legislation

02:33:16.370 --> 02:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:33:20.690 --> 02:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
um uh the fifth uh prioritized need is I
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned briefly our shellfish program
 
02:33:26.210 --> 02:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh so we were able to purchase new uh
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring buoys for water quality uh
 
02:33:32.690 --> 02:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
for Great Bay uh data Sons is Sue always
 
02:33:34.730 --> 02:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
wants me to say that uh she likes the
 
02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:36.770 align:start position:0%
wants me to say that uh she likes the
word

02:33:36.770 --> 02:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
word
 
02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
um so uh the good news is we're able to
 
02:33:41.929 --> 02:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
do that but we also need they require a
 
02:33:45.170 --> 02:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
periodic maintenance and we need to to
 
02:33:47.450 --> 02:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
budget for that otherwise we'll have
 
02:33:50.090 --> 02:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
lost that money that was so badly needed
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
and again the program is very successful
 
02:33:55.370 --> 02:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh in that industry is
 
02:33:57.889 --> 02:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
uh very appreciative of the program and
 
02:33:59.870 --> 02:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
and uh should you need I'm sure I can
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
get you a lot of letters of support for
 
02:34:01.439 --> 02:34:02.510 align:start position:0%
get you a lot of letters of support for
that

02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:03.110 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
privatize need number six is
 
02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:06.950 align:start position:0%
privatize need number six is
um

02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
regarding stream gauges so historically
 
02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
des and Department of Transportation uh
 
02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
use information out of uh 2017 stream
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
gauges by that are maintained by the
 
02:34:22.429 --> 02:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
federal USGS uh and we have a
 
02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
long-standing mou that we do a
 
02:34:30.770 --> 02:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
uh cost share with with DOT uh this this
 
02:34:33.469 --> 02:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
biennium uh the USGS has raised the cost
 
02:34:36.889 --> 02:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
by uh roughly six percent so this this
 
02:34:39.170 --> 02:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
represents out of the the highway fund
 
02:34:43.849 --> 02:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
uh the dot uh share that that cost
 
02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh and again those are important
 
02:34:49.130 --> 02:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
certainly to us again because uh we
 
02:34:51.530 --> 02:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
managed I mentioned all those dams uh
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
and uh knowing the the flooding that's
 
02:34:55.730 --> 02:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
happening and what's going on with the
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
rivers and the water bodies feeding
 
02:34:59.450 --> 02:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
those dams is very important to proper
 
02:34:59.460 --> 02:35:00.349 align:start position:0%
those dams is very important to proper
management

02:35:00.349 --> 02:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
management
 
02:35:04.370 --> 02:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh item eight for our prioritized needs
 
02:35:07.370 --> 02:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
oh did I miss seven oh thank you sorry
 
02:35:09.530 --> 02:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
Mike I I have my direct division
 
02:35:11.270 --> 02:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
director in the background Skyline at me
 
02:35:14.270 --> 02:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh is for solid waste we have two uh
 
02:35:17.570 --> 02:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
online landfills that we there are no
 
02:35:20.929 --> 02:35:20.939 align:start position:0%
responsible parties for that need uh in
 
02:35:23.389 --> 02:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
order to keep them safe and and uh not
 
02:35:27.469 --> 02:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
impactful to the the communities uh that
 
02:35:30.830 --> 02:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
we need to fund contracts to to do at
 
02:35:32.570 --> 02:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
least basic monitoring and maintenance
 
02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
for those two landfills one's in Danbury
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
and one's in in Berlin so that's item
 
02:35:41.450 --> 02:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
seven uh item eight so I go to that now
 
02:35:44.450 --> 02:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
is uh is for I mentioned our
 
02:35:47.389 --> 02:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee River Basin so that is a
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
an increase in cost for them again this
 
02:35:52.610 --> 02:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
is 100 funded by the 10 member
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
communities uh we've been communicating
 
02:35:57.170 --> 02:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
them with them regularly so this is not
 
02:36:01.250 --> 02:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
a surprise to them uh but uh probably no
 
02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
surprise these type of activities moving
 
02:36:05.530 --> 02:36:05.540 align:start position:0%
water is a very very energy
 
02:36:09.650 --> 02:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
intensive Endeavor and is probably not
 
02:36:12.410 --> 02:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
lost on anybody but energy costs are are
 
02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
going up quite a bit uh cost of
 
02:36:19.610 --> 02:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
chemicals uh in parts so we have a
 
02:36:21.469 --> 02:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
program for that the waste right
 
02:36:23.330 --> 02:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
treatment facility to do upgrades that
 
02:36:24.429 --> 02:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
type of thing
 
02:36:27.170 --> 02:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
you'll see a lot of debt service in the
 
02:36:29.929 --> 02:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget for this program but
 
02:36:31.610 --> 02:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
the there's only so much maintenance
 
02:36:33.710 --> 02:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
that can be so upgrades can be done so
 
02:36:36.349 --> 02:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
what happens is now we need to obviously
 
02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
the the until you do the uh upgrades the
 
02:36:43.130 --> 02:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
the maintenance actually tends to
 
02:36:45.469 --> 02:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
increase and the cost of those parts are
 
02:36:47.870 --> 02:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
reflected in this also so so again
 
02:36:51.170 --> 02:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
that's what that is for number eight uh
 
02:36:53.450 --> 02:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
item number nine is I mentioned the the
 
02:36:56.809 --> 02:36:56.819 align:start position:0%
the over 270 state-owned dams we're
 
02:36:59.210 --> 02:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintenance uh one issue
 
02:37:00.530 --> 02:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
is that is you can't have too much
 
02:37:03.650 --> 02:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
growth on the the grass and whatnot so
 
02:37:07.309 --> 02:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
so it it it could cause erosion into the
 
02:37:10.969 --> 02:37:10.979 align:start position:0%
dams so uh we're asking for a slope
 
02:37:13.370 --> 02:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
mower which is a special mower for the
 
02:37:17.210 --> 02:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
the side slopes of the dams to to allow
 
02:37:20.270 --> 02:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
us to more efficiently address that
 
02:37:25.130 --> 02:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
uh item 10 is uh for stadia Grants so
 
02:37:26.990 --> 02:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
stating grants is typically for
 
02:37:29.330 --> 02:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
Wastewater facilities it's a state
 
02:37:32.570 --> 02:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
program long-standing uh it's an after
 
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
the fat program that the legislature
 
02:37:39.889 --> 02:37:39.899 align:start position:0%
again continues to fund uh that a
 
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
facility is done is done they submit to
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
us and it's on the order of what 20
 
02:37:46.319 --> 02:37:47.830 align:start position:0%
us and it's on the order of what 20
percent

02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:37:51.410 --> 02:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
that the state then gives them after the
 
02:37:54.530 --> 02:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
fact for having done that work so this
 
02:37:56.929 --> 02:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
is not for number 10 is not for any new
 
02:38:01.490 --> 02:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
Pro any new uh work or any new grants
 
02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
being added to that list this is to
 
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
serve the the projects that have already
 
02:38:08.270 --> 02:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
gone through the the GNC program process
 
02:38:10.730 --> 02:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
executive Council and better prove where
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
we feel we have an obligation to fund
 
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
those so that's item number 10.
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:21.359 --> 02:38:23.150 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:38:26.450 --> 02:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
sorry as for doit uh and again it's
 
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
primarily for software increases and as
 
02:38:30.110 --> 02:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
you're probably again heard from
 
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
everybody uh even the the Microsoft
 
02:38:36.349 --> 02:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
products we use have you know there's a
 
02:38:38.590 --> 02:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
price to be had for those
 
02:38:42.530 --> 02:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
similarly uh for for item number 12 is
 
02:38:44.330 --> 02:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh Department of administrative services
 
02:38:46.090 --> 02:38:46.100 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:38:49.610 --> 02:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
director Gary you can ask who's your
 
02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:51.110 align:start position:0%
director Gary you can ask who's your
Rockwell

02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
Rockwell
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
um so so that's the there's their uh
 
02:38:58.250 --> 02:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
portion of of our costs including about
 
02:39:02.210 --> 02:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
mostly related to workman comp expenses
 
02:39:06.610 --> 02:39:06.620 align:start position:0%
so then moving to slide 16.
 
02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:39:11.770 --> 02:39:11.780 align:start position:0%
is we talked about the bipartisan
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
partisan infrastructure law the the bill
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure bill as I call it uh
 
02:39:21.650 --> 02:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
these are related to funding increases
 
02:39:24.650 --> 02:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
from that those so these again are very
 
02:39:27.349 --> 02:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
impactful for the communities uh very
 
02:39:30.830 --> 02:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
important to fund but that also does
 
02:39:33.170 --> 02:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
increase our budget and show a need to
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
increase our budget so this these are by
 
02:39:38.270 --> 02:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
and large programs all all through this
 
02:39:40.969 --> 02:39:40.979 align:start position:0%
page uh that are you'll see over the
 
02:39:44.929 --> 02:39:44.939 align:start position:0%
next five years uh for the most part and
 
02:39:47.929 --> 02:39:47.939 align:start position:0%
they range from the drinking water uh
 
02:39:51.230 --> 02:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
clean water and then again the number 17
 
02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
is for emerging contaminants so it
 
02:39:56.090 --> 02:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't pfas for those who have heard
 
02:39:58.849 --> 02:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
that word is that four letter word is is
 
02:40:00.889 --> 02:40:00.899 align:start position:0%
the one that gets suppressed a lot but
 
02:40:02.210 --> 02:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
there are other emerging contaminants
 
02:40:04.429 --> 02:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
that can fall under this and again that
 
02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
goes under the the aspect I was talking
 
02:40:08.570 --> 02:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
about earlier is the science changes
 
02:40:11.150 --> 02:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
we're finding more things to address so
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
I suppose the good news on that is
 
02:40:14.830 --> 02:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
Congress has allocated
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't actually received the money
 
02:40:18.770 --> 02:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
yet but we expect on the order of 10
 
02:40:21.530 --> 02:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year for emerging
 
02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:23.750 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year for emerging
contaminants

02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
02:40:25.730 --> 02:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
so almost done with our prioritized
 
02:40:27.889 --> 02:40:27.899 align:start position:0%
needs so we have a lot of needs all I
 
02:40:30.349 --> 02:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
can say is uh
 
02:40:33.770 --> 02:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
is under page 17 uh prioritize need
 
02:40:37.070 --> 02:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
number 18 is uh again through the
 
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Bill we received extra
 
02:40:44.090 --> 02:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
monies for our dam safety program uh to
 
02:40:46.429 --> 02:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
assist with them inspections again not
 
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
only for our 274 dams in the state but
 
02:40:52.090 --> 02:40:52.100 align:start position:0%
it will be over 2600 dams in the state
 
02:40:55.070 --> 02:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
in training so that's that's uh very
 
02:40:56.830 --> 02:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
impactful money so we're happy to
 
02:40:59.349 --> 02:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully be able to accept that
 
02:41:03.469 --> 02:41:03.479 align:start position:0%
prioritize need 19 is for brownfields so
 
02:41:05.330 --> 02:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
this is monies that have come to the
 
02:41:07.969 --> 02:41:07.979 align:start position:0%
agency for site assessments for mostly
 
02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
underserved communities to help
 
02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
communities redevelop those sites so
 
02:41:15.290 --> 02:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
um item number 20 is our Coastal
 
02:41:19.250 --> 02:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
resiliency program and this is uh Monies
 
02:41:22.429 --> 02:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
to help with closer projects I'll give
 
02:41:24.290 --> 02:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
you an example with Culvert replacements
 
02:41:26.570 --> 02:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
for instance so you know if you have an
 
02:41:29.270 --> 02:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
undersized Culvert going under a road
 
02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
and there's a storm uh the impacts of
 
02:41:34.370 --> 02:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
that typically at the end of the day if
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
it's a big enough storm will be to erode
 
02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
around the Culvert and take the road out
 
02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to avoid that so in the
 
02:41:42.590 --> 02:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
future we would like larger culverts to
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
to be sized for that so that's the type
 
02:41:48.429 --> 02:41:48.439 align:start position:0%
of type of work uh that item number 20
 
02:41:52.969 --> 02:41:52.979 align:start position:0%
uh is for in item 21 is again for
 
02:41:55.809 --> 02:41:55.819 align:start position:0%
Combined sewer overflows in storm water
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
those are grants to the communities as
 
02:42:01.490 --> 02:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
well a lot of work to be done there uh
 
02:42:04.610 --> 02:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
this last slide is uh Sue was kind
 
02:42:07.849 --> 02:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
enough again to kind of characterize uh
 
02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
where our prioritized needs goes under
 
02:42:12.889 --> 02:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
uh and you'll see by and large the
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
certainly the largest chunk uh is uh the
 
02:42:17.210 --> 02:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
federal funds the infrastructure bill
 
02:42:21.469 --> 02:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
money as I talk about so with that uh in
 
02:42:23.630 --> 02:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
the I'm happy to answer any questions
 
02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
again being the last one of the the
 
02:42:28.130 --> 02:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
three days I'm curious how many
 
02:42:29.929 --> 02:42:29.939 align:start position:0%
questions I'll actually get but I'm sure
 
02:42:32.510 --> 02:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
you'll entertain me too yeah well thank
 
02:42:35.210 --> 02:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
you uh and I and I thank you and and
 
02:42:37.370 --> 02:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
Yusuf for uh
 
02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh helping us along the way over the
 
02:42:41.750 --> 02:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
last few months with all your meetings
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
so hopefully our questions can be kept
 
02:42:44.990 --> 02:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
to a minimal but one of the things I
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
want to touch on is pfas given is it's
 
02:42:50.270 --> 02:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh that the publicity it's gotten and
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
the money that's gone into it and I
 
02:42:53.450 --> 02:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have this figure now
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
but as well if you could uh if you did
 
02:42:59.510 --> 02:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
the total amount of money that has been
 
02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
spent to date on the pfas program since
 
02:43:04.490 --> 02:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
maybe uh going through the last budget
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
so from fiscal year through fiscal year
 
02:43:09.410 --> 02:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
22 and then into fiscal year 23 and this
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
would include not only General funds but
 
02:43:15.050 --> 02:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
Federal money is too including arpa
 
02:43:16.969 --> 02:43:16.979 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's the first part of
 
02:43:18.110 --> 02:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:43:22.010 --> 02:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
and then my next part of that is what
 
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
have we gotten for that money meaning is
 
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
there a way to quantify how much of the
 
02:43:28.490 --> 02:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
problem has been fixed and how much is
 
02:43:30.770 --> 02:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
remaining and what sort of the timeline
 
02:43:33.530 --> 02:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
is to eradicate if it's even possible
 
02:43:35.210 --> 02:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
the knee fast problem in New Hampshire
 
02:43:38.450 --> 02:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
so I can maybe pick out the last
 
02:43:41.710 --> 02:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
question part of the question first so
 
02:43:44.090 --> 02:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
not that you'd want to but if you look
 
02:43:46.130 --> 02:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
at a map of sampling which we do have
 
02:43:49.309 --> 02:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
nationally New Hampshire is very unique
 
02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
in that the whole state is represented
 
02:43:53.389 --> 02:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
so we've we've done a great job of
 
02:43:56.270 --> 02:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
sampling uh we were able to use drinking
 
02:43:58.450 --> 02:43:58.460 align:start position:0%
water groundwater trust fund money in
 
02:44:02.030 --> 02:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
2017 to help fund that initiative among
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
other other things so we we have we're
 
02:44:07.309 --> 02:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
better positions than most States as far
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
as we've done a lot of testing that
 
02:44:10.730 --> 02:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean every well in the state's
 
02:44:12.590 --> 02:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
been tested but we have a better feeling
 
02:44:15.710 --> 02:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
than most of where the contamination is
 
02:44:15.720 --> 02:44:16.309 align:start position:0%
than most of where the contamination is
um

02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:19.070 --> 02:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
I talked about moving goal posts so we
 
02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
have a state drinking water standard uh
 
02:44:23.570 --> 02:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
we have one of the programs I didn't
 
02:44:25.490 --> 02:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
mention in our structures we actually
 
02:44:27.230 --> 02:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
have an environmental health program so
 
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
we have a toxicologist and we work with
 
02:44:31.010 --> 02:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
healthy human services and we set
 
02:44:33.230 --> 02:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
drinking water standards we have a
 
02:44:35.450 --> 02:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
drinking water standard for pfas
 
02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
EPA with the current Administration is
 
02:44:39.410 --> 02:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
doing their own standard which
 
02:44:42.889 --> 02:44:42.899 align:start position:0%
potentially could be an order of
 
02:44:44.690 --> 02:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
magnitude even lower I don't think so
 
02:44:47.090 --> 02:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
but that's still in play so that's
 
02:44:49.010 --> 02:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
another area where the goal posts may
 
02:44:51.469 --> 02:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
move by the way so if they if obviously
 
02:44:52.790 --> 02:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
if there's a federal standard and it's
 
02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's more stringent than what we're
 
02:44:56.809 --> 02:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
doing everybody will have to comply with
 
02:44:58.550 --> 02:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
that and rightly so
 
02:45:01.849 --> 02:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
so having said that what we have done is
 
02:45:04.250 --> 02:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
where we were aware of contamination
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
issues we're being able to use the funds
 
02:45:08.690 --> 02:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
so off the top of my head we talked
 
02:45:11.210 --> 02:45:11.220 align:start position:0%
already about the 50 million dollar Loan
 
02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:12.290 align:start position:0%
already about the 50 million dollar Loan
program

02:45:12.290 --> 02:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:45:15.410 --> 02:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh we this last session we received 25
 
02:45:19.010 --> 02:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
million estate Surplus to address pfas
 
02:45:22.130 --> 02:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
issues uh I don't remember the number if
 
02:45:23.929 --> 02:45:23.939 align:start position:0%
it's 5 or 15 million I guess probably
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
five out of the drinking water
 
02:45:28.429 --> 02:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund so what we've
 
02:45:30.349 --> 02:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
been able to and then again we're about
 
02:45:32.510 --> 02:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
to receive at least 10 million a year
 
02:45:35.389 --> 02:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
from the federal monies on on that so so
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
far to date we haven't had any federal
 
02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
money directly having said that for pfas
 
02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
if you
 
02:45:44.270 --> 02:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you well that's the 20 yeah
 
02:45:46.010 --> 02:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
that that's true and then and then
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
another 25 million in our money that's
 
02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:48.830 align:start position:0%
another 25 million in our money that's
right

02:45:48.830 --> 02:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:45:52.130 --> 02:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
um on top of that so uh consider that
 
02:45:53.809 --> 02:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
Federal money because it was up to the
 
02:45:55.969 --> 02:45:55.979 align:start position:0%
state's discretion on where to put it uh
 
02:45:58.730 --> 02:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
so so if you don't consider the upper
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
matter of federal money we haven't
 
02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
received any federal money toward this
 
02:46:02.809 --> 02:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
yet with the exception of
 
02:46:05.150 --> 02:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
the state revolving loan funds do
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
qualify right so if you're a drinking
 
02:46:08.750 --> 02:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
water system you're impacted you could
 
02:46:10.490 --> 02:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
get a loan with a certain model of
 
02:46:12.770 --> 02:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
forgiveness based on that and now we're
 
02:46:14.690 --> 02:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
about to get at least 10 million dollars
 
02:46:17.270 --> 02:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
a year so that so having said all that I
 
02:46:19.250 --> 02:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
think the needs still probably uh
 
02:46:21.889 --> 02:46:21.899 align:start position:0%
upstrip the the amount but we're we've
 
02:46:23.450 --> 02:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
been fairly well positioned compared to
 
02:46:25.610 --> 02:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
other states and that we've leaned ahead
 
02:46:27.469 --> 02:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
so we know know what the problem is it's
 
02:46:29.450 --> 02:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
already characterized and we've already
 
02:46:31.969 --> 02:46:31.979 align:start position:0%
started spending Monies to address it a
 
02:46:33.469 --> 02:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
lot of States haven't been in that place
 
02:46:33.479 --> 02:46:34.790 align:start position:0%
lot of States haven't been in that place
yet

02:46:34.790 --> 02:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
yet
 
02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:35.990 align:start position:0%
yet
um

02:46:35.990 --> 02:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:38.450 --> 02:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
and I feel so for programs there are
 
02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
things I wanted to highlight is not only
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
will be able to address for the drinking
 
02:46:44.450 --> 02:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
water groundwater trust fund or or other
 
02:46:47.809 --> 02:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
funds uh systems that have been impacted
 
02:46:50.690 --> 02:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
and provided assistance uh we also
 
02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
unique in that we're able to use some of
 
02:46:55.370 --> 02:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
these funds to address private drinking
 
02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
water wells so we have a Statewide
 
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
program for pfas where if you if you're
 
02:47:03.710 --> 02:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
well it's been contaminated you can it's
 
02:47:05.330 --> 02:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
a reimbursement program again we just
 
02:47:07.250 --> 02:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
don't give money and I hope it's the
 
02:47:10.610 --> 02:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
right amount and the people pocket it is
 
02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh you can well you're up you're it's a
 
02:47:16.130 --> 02:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
grant program of up to five thousand
 
02:47:19.010 --> 02:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
dollars for each individual well to put
 
02:47:20.809 --> 02:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
treatment on that well
 
02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
having said that since we were we really
 
02:47:25.070 --> 02:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
our preferred outcome is that you
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
connect to a public water system
 
02:47:29.570 --> 02:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
then if if you're close enough to a
 
02:47:31.250 --> 02:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
public water system will that program
 
02:47:32.990 --> 02:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
will give you up to ten thousand dollars
 
02:47:35.090 --> 02:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
to connect to that public water system
 
02:47:37.730 --> 02:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
so that's available Statewide it's in
 
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
play right now there's every day there's
 
02:47:42.050 --> 02:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
there's work going on in that so again
 
02:47:44.690 --> 02:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying we've we've beat the pfas
 
02:47:46.969 --> 02:47:46.979 align:start position:0%
issue but I think you'll find we are
 
02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
probably better positioned than I would
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
argue any other state right now so
 
02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
um this is just a follow-up on the
 
02:47:58.910 --> 02:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
prioritized need regarding the state aid
 
02:48:01.550 --> 02:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
grants the Wastewater one of the largest
 
02:48:03.710 --> 02:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
chunks of General funds
 
02:48:05.450 --> 02:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
um I think I think so you had mentioned
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
that these projects have already already
 
02:48:09.349 --> 02:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
been or would have already been
 
02:48:11.450 --> 02:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
completed and already approved through
 
02:48:13.849 --> 02:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
GNC yes
 
02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
um so are these entities then you know
 
02:48:18.889 --> 02:48:18.899 align:start position:0%
already counting on this money coming to
 
02:48:22.130 --> 02:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
them is there a timeline that they
 
02:48:24.770 --> 02:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
expect that money to come to them you
 
02:48:26.690 --> 02:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
know how does that work with the
 
02:48:26.700 --> 02:48:28.429 align:start position:0%
know how does that work with the
Arrangement

02:48:28.429 --> 02:48:28.439 align:start position:0%
Arrangement
 
02:48:30.530 --> 02:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
um the way the state grant program works
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
is we essentially pay 20 of their Debt
 
02:48:37.730 --> 02:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
Service payments so we pay them in time
 
02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
to their Debt Service payments so if the
 
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester is making Debt
 
02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
Service payments in October and April we
 
02:48:47.330 --> 02:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
will make payments to them in October
 
02:48:50.570 --> 02:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
and April so if that is not funded that
 
02:48:52.250 --> 02:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
impact is that they would
 
02:48:54.170 --> 02:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
be responsible for
 
02:48:56.870 --> 02:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes finding that okay and then in the
 
02:48:59.330 --> 02:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget along the same lines
 
02:49:02.570 --> 02:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
um is the efficiency budget based on for
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
the state aid program based on
 
02:49:06.830 --> 02:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
anticipated contracts coming forward or
 
02:49:08.690 --> 02:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
projects coming forward or those also
 
02:49:11.690 --> 02:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
projects that have already been approved
 
02:49:14.090 --> 02:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
um for the state aid program
 
02:49:16.929 --> 02:49:16.939 align:start position:0%
well we were in a unique situation for
 
02:49:20.410 --> 02:49:20.420 align:start position:0%
22-23 where um in the governor's budget
 
02:49:23.090 --> 02:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit was fully funded
 
02:49:24.889 --> 02:49:24.899 align:start position:0%
for existing programs
 
02:49:27.650 --> 02:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
during the legislative phase this
 
02:49:29.570 --> 02:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
funding was removed from the operating
 
02:49:33.650 --> 02:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
budget and given back to us as a part of
 
02:49:37.849 --> 02:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
hb2 from Surplus from prior years
 
02:49:41.150 --> 02:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
um so it doesn't show if you were to
 
02:49:43.969 --> 02:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
look actually in our operating budget
 
02:49:47.690 --> 02:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
you would see for water
 
02:49:50.330 --> 02:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
um we're showing a zero budget
 
02:49:54.349 --> 02:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:56.750 --> 02:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh page 61
 
02:49:59.210 --> 02:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
you would see for 23 you would see a
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
zero budget number here
 
02:50:06.110 --> 02:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
in the meantime we have been granted
 
02:50:08.510 --> 02:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
through other legislation an additional
 
02:50:12.410 --> 02:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
12 million dollars to make new Awards so
 
02:50:15.230 --> 02:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
we are in the process during 22 and 23
 
02:50:19.550 --> 02:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
actually 23 and 24. we are making new
 
02:50:22.490 --> 02:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
grin Awards and that increase is
 
02:50:25.370 --> 02:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
reflected for the ongoing payments in
 
02:50:28.190 --> 02:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
our request for 24 and 25.
 
02:50:31.070 --> 02:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:33.830 --> 02:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:50:37.250 --> 02:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
this concludes the governor's budget
 
02:50:37.260 --> 02:50:38.750 align:start position:0%
this concludes the governor's budget
