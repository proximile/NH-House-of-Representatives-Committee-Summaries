00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
it is now 10 o'clock we will get started
 
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
and welcome the conservation land
 
00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
stewardship program so welcome and which
 
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
we are on page
 
00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
105 and this appears to have two
 
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
employees I guess you're one of
 
00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 align:start position:0%
them oh okay one's vacant
 
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
is yeah thank you perfect testing
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay yeah um so my name is Charlotte
 
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
Harding I previously worked with uh
 
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
Steve Walker who is the director of the
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
conservation land stewardship
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
program uh and my supervisor Steve has
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
since retired so I'm here um the
 
00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 align:start position:0%
overarching purpose of the conservation
 
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
land stewardship program is to protect
 
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
the state's investments in interests on
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
conservation lands so we help monitor
 
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
Steward and provide oversight for
 
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
conservation easements which the state
 
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
and um I am familiar with our budget I
 
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
was involved with the FY uh 2627 budget
 
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
development and if you have any
 
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions that I don't know the answer
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
to um I am happy to follow up uh with
 
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
with answers to those all right thank
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
you on the page
 
00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 align:start position:0%
106 um uh transfers from other agencies
 
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
and agents talk about the source of
 
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
funds right so yes um so we currently
 
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
have two sources of funding one of those
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
sources is from an endowment that is
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
held at the State Treasury and
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
administered by the Council on resources
 
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.510 align:start position:0%
administered by the Council on resources
and

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
development the other source of funding
 
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
which would be the transfer from other
 
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
agencies is um those are funds provided
 
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
by the fish and game department for
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring of
 
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.550 align:start position:0%
monitoring of
conservation

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
easements uh that are not held in that
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
treasury so these endowment funds that's
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh some dedicated fund that um we could
 
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
look up in RSA 612 is that uh yes so I
 
00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
believe RSA 162
 
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
C8 um was uh what established the the
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
endowment at treasury we call it the
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
land conservation endowment but that's
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
okay I think it just says the endowment
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
RSA does it get new money from
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
anything it does uh
 
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
so outside of that contract that's
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
listed as the 001 transferred from other
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
agencies uh fishing game when they uh
 
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
develop new conservation easement
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
properties they
 
00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
um work with us and partner agencies to
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
actually contribute a to add a
 
00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
contribution to the land conservation
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
endowment um and that is for the
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
Perpetual uh monitoring and stewardship
 
00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
property okay representative evil um
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being here and
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
for what you do if I understand what the
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
purpose of this program is it's to
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
protect the state's interest in lands
 
00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
that we have conservation easements
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
correct on so um just give us an example
 
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
of a couple of important pieces of
 
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
property uh that you would be involved
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
in because it seems to me that you have
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
a important role to fill for our state
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um so our program was uh when it
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
was originally created it was known as
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
the land conservation investment program
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
which was a uh a land acquisition
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
program that ran in the late 80s to
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
early 90s and the state acquired over
 
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
100,000 acres of conservation land
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
through that program and about half of
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
those properties were acquired by state
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
departments in fee meaning that uh
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
fishing game or Department of Natural
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources uh outright own
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
those properties and manage them
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
internally um and then the other half of
 
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
those properties were acquired as
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
conservation easements owned by private
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
land owners some are nonprofits uh some
 
00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
are just private
 
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
citizens um some of the larger pieces of
 
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
properties that we are involved with
 
00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:22.039 align:start position:0%
would include the musoma headwaters area
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
up in uh
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
Canan I'm trying to think of oh uh there
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
is a very large uh elip property in
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
gilmington that was preserved by uh the
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
the Boy Scouts organization and it's now
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
known as the the Hidden Valley Boy Scout
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
camp um and that backs up to other lcip
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
properties as well so there are
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
groupings of properties to create large
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
tracks of uh forested
 
00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
lands I am trying to think of some other
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
that you might recognize the name of
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
well so lcip was the was the uh
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
organization that preceded the creation
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
of lchip right Andre so it was financed
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
by the state as I recall and so the
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
state was actually buying properties
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this lcip program that was
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
replaced is Nash stream or any of those
 
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
large properties up there part of what
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
was acquired through
 
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
lcip yes so Nash stream was acquired
 
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
through the lcip in fee uh so we don't
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
have involvement with that particular
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
property because it is managed by uh the
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
resources okay but yeah that was a I
 
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
believe the largest property acquired
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
through the lcip one that I remembered
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so I don't see any money
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
in here for like tree trimming or
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
anything so what what do you do with
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
these properties yeah so um what we do
 
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
as far as stewardship it's it's really
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's hands off so as opposed to doing
 
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:06.839 align:start position:0%
Trail work and maintaining boundaries
 
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
what we do to protect the state's
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
interest is first and foremost maintain
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
relationships with the land owners and
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
we communicate with them annually to go
 
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
over changes to those properties in past
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
years and plans for changes in the
 
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
coming years we uh Monitor and inspect
 
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
the boundaries of these properties to
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
check for encroachments
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh from from a Butters we monitor the
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
properties to ensure that they're being
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
used um according to the purposes of the
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
conservation easement Deeds which we
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
consider to be the The Authority for
 
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
proper use of those properties uh so we
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
can look for
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
incompatible uh public uses many of the
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
properties do not allow let's say
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
motorized wheeled vehicles or um or
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
General recreation activities that
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be considered to be transitory
 
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.430 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be considered to be transitory
and

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
passive uh almost all of the properties
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
are open to public access uh including
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
for hunting and fishing hiking basically
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
low impact uses so we monitor the
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
properties uh every year for
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
incompatible uses that are not allowed
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
by those conservation easement
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
Deeds so it's all about easements as
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
opposed to property the state owns is
 
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
that correct correct okay thank you are
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
evil I apologize it's not exactly a
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
question but um I've been involved in
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
some land trust type organizations and
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
when what can happen is people can start
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
building on these preserved lands and
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
and you know like breaking through the
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
the um deed requirements and and um and
 
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
just like misusing the land there can be
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
dumping on on lands like this of
 
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste and so part of
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
stewardship once you get a conservation
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
easement or the state owns something in
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
fee which she's involved in you just
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that um it's being
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
used properly that's basically that's
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
correct so it's just a really important
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
role they
 
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
fill just a moment so Jack could you get
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
us the page from the dedicated funds
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
reports for this
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
endowment land endowment um dedicated
 
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
fund all right thank you represent
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
W was going to be my question do you
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
have a dedicated fund you obviously do
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes do you remember the
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
title the title of the dedicated fund I
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
I I believe the treasury has the title
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
as the land conservation
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
endowment so basically the operation in
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
your office is is going out and checking
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
on all these properties I see you've
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
gone up in your your your uh
 
00:13:02.829 --> 00:13:02.839 align:start position:0%
instate travels going way
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
up yes and the primary reason for that
 
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
is because our we were using a state
 
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
issued vehicle that we had
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
actually we didn't acquire it ourselves
 
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
it was a bit of a hand-me-down from the
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
office that we were previously embedded
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
within we were a part of the office of
 
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.389 align:start position:0%
within we were a part of the office of
strategic

00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
strategic
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
initiatives um so we had been using that
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle over the past several years
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
since that office disbanded uh the
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle is no longer
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
functional um we I believe had listed a
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
new vehicle as one of our prioritized
 
00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:47.959 align:start position:0%
needs uh for the new banum but we have
 
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:52.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
few maybe I don't know how to put it but
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
basically um cord who timately holds the
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
Authority for uh all lcip lands and
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
administers uh funds from our endowment
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
has identified some issues as far as um
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
our our ability to procure a new vehicle
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
um so we raised our funds for instate
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
travel so that we can use our our
 
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
personal vehicles to go ahead and
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
monitor those properties do we need the
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
second person in this office and if if
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
we get a second person are they going to
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
do something different than what you're
 
00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
doing now or more of the same that's a
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
good question
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
um I would say that the office
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
runs more efficiently with two
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
people um as far as whether it's a need
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll say that I have been covering
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
my role as as well as the directors for
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
the past 2 months since he retired so it
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
is possible to run as a single full-time
 
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
is possible to run as a single full-time
Staff

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
ideal thank you representative Camal
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so did do you and the
 
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
former director actually go into the
 
00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759 align:start position:0%
field to do all the inspections
 
00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:28.839 align:start position:0%
yourselves yes we do we also we do have
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
a a seasonal position um
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
see trying to find where that would be
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
class 050 yes so class 050 is um to fund
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
our our seasonal position and we
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
actually just onboarded our seasonal and
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
the seasonal uh focuses heavily on
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring as well so um but yes the the
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
two full-time positions also monitor I
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
would say that traditionally the
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
director's role spends a lot more time
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
in the office uh taking care of the
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
administrative side of things while uh
 
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
position supervised by the director
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
focuses more heavily on the field okay
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
and uh what is your enforcement arm is
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
it fishing game who enforces when you do
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
find violations yeah thank you um so so
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
CLS uh ourselves we do not have
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement Authority so we do refer
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement issues over to the grantee
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
agencies who hold these conservation
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
easements uh when an easement when an
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
issue is found with an lcip easement
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
those grantee agencies have the option
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
to forward that enforcement authority
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
over to the Council on resources and
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
development if that grantee agency feels
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
that they are um not comfortable
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
addressing the
 
00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.029 align:start position:0%
addressing the
issue

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Jack was the um on class
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
17 this extra 11,000 in fiscal year 25
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
retirement okay do you know I believe it
 
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
is yeah because I think there's some
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
kind of payment you get right on
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
retirement right right yeah okay very
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
good all right other questions no no I I
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
was just going to say so basically
 
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
you're you're monitoring the State
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
Properties identifying if there are
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
issues and then sending those issues to
 
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
the like fish and game or whomever to do
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
the enforcement um right but some of
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
that of course can be working with the
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
land owners to try to get the infraction
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
worked out I mean some of these things
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
can be really a lot of work and some not
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
so much so yes it could be something as
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
small as you know in a butter throwing a
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
Christmas tree over a boundary and
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
something as large as a property
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
being subdivided uh when the easement
 
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
says no subdivision is allowed or uh a
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
structure is built without uh grantee
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
permissions and its purpose is not um
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
compatible with the purposes of the
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
easement so yeah we do uh we do our best
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
to work from the landowner level up so
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
when we do find issues uh smaller issues
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
we tend to work with land owners in
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
abutters to go ahead and correct those
 
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.630 align:start position:0%
abutters to go ahead and correct those
to

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
um to mostly to save on on staff time
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
and uh because we know that the granty
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
agencies themselves they don't
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
manage these properties um
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
and we've experienced when we have
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
forwarded some issues over to granty
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
agencies they often uh don't have the
 
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to to deal with it in the
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
short term so so I I think the upshot is
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
in addition to doing the monitoring you
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
do work with land owners to work out
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
issues at sort of a lower more user
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
friendly yes level yeah and the best way
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
to avoid issues is to maintain uh a
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
relationship let me ask this so I'm we
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
now have your dedicated fund report here
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
do you have a copy yeah uh no I do not
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
put on this side there you go so
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
um where it says other sources of funds
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
so when someone puts land into
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
conservation gives you a conservation
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
easement that somehow generates a fee
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
that goes into this fund is that right
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
or a payment of some kind yeah so when
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
fish and game uh gets a new conservation
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
easement they're typically work working
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
with a partner organization and the
 
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
funds that get um contributed to the
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
endowment come directly from those
 
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.470 align:start position:0%
endowment come directly from those
partner

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
partner
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
organizations and the fee that is
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
contributed is based on a stewardship
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
calculator which is a a matrix we use to
 
00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.590 align:start position:0%
calculator which is a a matrix we use to
determine

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
um what what the appropriate
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
contribution would be that's based on a
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
10 years of stewardship and we've also
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
been advised by the treasury that uh we
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
should count on withdrawing no more than
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
4 and a half% of um the investment
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
income from the endowment per
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
year so um I understand okay do you know
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
what happened in 2022 there was a large
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
a million dollars taken away from this
 
00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.710 align:start position:0%
a million dollars taken away from this
fund

00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:04.669 align:start position:0%
fund
in

00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
2022 I am not sure off the top of my
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
head what that what caused that thank
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
you yeah the reduction in funds all
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
right um well I think that's one more
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
question no I wondered if I could make a
 
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
motion no I I'm I'm not quite ready to
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
take a motion so we'll we'll talk about
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
this okay so the only other thing I
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to say I is is it a correct
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
statement to say that um when proper
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
in recognition of the amount of work
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
that it takes to ensure that easements
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
are respected by land
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
owners is it a correct statement to say
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
that there's been a lot more emphasis on
 
00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
stewardship within the land protection
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
Community now recognizing there's an
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
ongoing responsibility and that it costs
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
money yes yeah in the in the
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
conservation Community um there is more
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
emphasis being placed on stewardship
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
because you know it's it's always
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
exciting to protect a new piece of land
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
but that's really when the work begins
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
and yeah needing to protect it
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative camell thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
uh the open position for the director I
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
know that there's a hiring freeze right
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
now but were they actively looking for
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
candidates and did you have any
 
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
candidates lined up before the
 
00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:29.799 align:start position:0%
freeze um so I was I was informed at the
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
end of the day yesterday by HR that I
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%

00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:41.799 align:start position:0%
promotion into the director's
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%

were any candidates lined up beforehand
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%

yeah so specifically peace Development
 
00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
Authority the enabling statute was to
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
was to be the airport sponsor for
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
Portsmith International Airport after um
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
the air force closed P Air Force Base
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
under the Brack closure in
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
1991 um specifically uh there was a a
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
land public transfer that allowed the
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense to maintain the
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Air National Guard so
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
approximately 2400 Acres um were
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
transferred to the state of New
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the thought process was was
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
to create a sustainable airport to
 
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
support the the Air National Guard uh
 
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
they currently still have a incredible
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
presence with their KC 46 modern
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
refueling Fleet um and in order to
 
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
sustain those financial obligations of
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
maintaining that large Airfield facility
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
the state was allowed to develop the
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
property um which is now the peas trade
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
Port industrial Commerce Park um
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
essentially it's a closed fiscal system
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
that any Revenue we generate from the
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
non- aono activity um and the
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
aeronautical activity that goes on there
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
goes into essentially an Enterprise fund
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
that allows us to maintain and operate
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
the Airfield that supports the
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
department of defenses the New Hampshire
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
International guards U Mission so none
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
of that shows up here it's it's only
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
Port related things that's correct we we
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
keep two sets of books um and that
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
really is a you know an FAA requirement
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
in our Federal grant assurance and and
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
that stems back to the original land
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
public transfer um so we keep two sets
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
of books one for the division of ports
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
and harbors and one's for one for PE
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
Development Authority um and also it
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
should be known that the division and
 
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
ports and harbors is also
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining our operating budget
 
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
does not impact the state's general fund
 
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
um we do from time to time
 
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
um uh use use resources of the states
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
but they're they're paid back through
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
through the work that that that uh your
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
your Finance team does um in Suzie is
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
there a dedicated fund for the airport
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
there is a dedicated fund um essentially
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
all of the funds um that are involved
 
00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:39.079 align:start position:0%
with the exception of division Imports
 
00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
and revenue is all airport
 
00:36:41.319 --> 00:36:43.510 align:start position:0%
and revenue is all airport
funds

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay so Melissa we can look at that okay
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
all right so go ahead um let's talk
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
about you have two two sections here one
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
with two people and one with
 
00:36:58.829 --> 00:36:58.839 align:start position:0%
three yes so basically the only uh line
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
items really in in our budget are wages
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
and benefits and some smaller
 
00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
administrative costs for insurance uh uh
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
watercraft policy and so um as these
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
costs are incurred um we reimburse the
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
state quarterly and we do an annual
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
reconciliation um to make sure that that
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know everything's been reimbursed
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
and um so as Paul mentioned uh the
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
expens expenditures um for the um
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
division of ports and harbors don't have
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
any impact on the state's general fund
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
everything is
 
00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and so we have uh you know
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
five positions and like I said just
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
benefits and some smaller administrative
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
costs so it's reimbursed because you
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
charge fees to people who bring in ships
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
is yeah the revenue is uh we're
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
generating the revenue from uh war and
 
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
dockage fees parking fees registration
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
fees moing fees um and that's what's
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
used to cover our operating expenses not
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
only the ones uh that are reflected here
 
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
but also the operating expenses that are
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
not um that are not at I guess what
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
you'd call the state level all right
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
let's start on page
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
518 so there's a big jump in overtime
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
from uh fiscal year 24 to 25 and Beyond
 
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:23.079 align:start position:0%
would you be better off with a temp
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
instead of all that overtime pardon me
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so this budget is put together by
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
services and so I don't know if they're
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
just allowing for some wiggle room but
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that if you're
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
looking to decrease some of the
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures this would be a line item
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
that we could um so you don't think
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
you're really using this amount of
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
overtime no well not I would just say
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
the nature of the business is at the
 
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
mercy of uh Commerce
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
specifically um the the bulk of the
 
00:38:59.790 --> 00:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
overtime is related to our security plan
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
at the deep water Port um and that is
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
reluctant on relies on the activity of
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
the vessels that are coming in for
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
instance um most of you probably dealing
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
with um salt roadway salt shortages at
 
00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
your at your hometowns um so we've seen
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
an uptick in those salt Ships coming
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
into the port uh that will create more
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
overtime to meet our security
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
requirements for those International
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
vessels um so it's somewhat uh fluid and
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
we so you're saying the vessel could
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
come in Sunday night or something and
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
then there' be over corre so we may have
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
a if there's no snow and inclement
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
weather next year we may not have as as
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
many vessels come in so we don't want to
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
commit to a a permanent or uh temp
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
employee at that level but uh obviously
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
our unit managers monitor this and if we
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
need it we'll certainly um you know put
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
put additional labor in okay and last
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
year's expenditures too there was not a
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
lot of activity um coming through the
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
port we were doing a construction
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
project and so we had fewer salt Ships
 
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
coming in so although it is a lower
 
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
number you know for the next two fiscal
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
years you know I can see a decrease but
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it's going to be as
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
low as it was in fiscal year 24 okay um
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
and then the workers comp line is is a
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
huge jump what's going on with that
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
one workers
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
comp from
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
we have seen an an overall uptick in our
 
00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:34.839 align:start position:0%
workers comp um six that only from 5.8
 
00:40:34.839 --> 00:40:36.510 align:start position:0%
workers comp um six that only from 5.8
to

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
6.6 UMES no that's Property and Casualty
 
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I'm sorry right
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
under I just wanted to decrease give um
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
just a couple Melissa a couple of
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
caveats one for workman's comp that's
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
just a straight cost from Das that they
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
get they have no um authority to change
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
that or adjust that it's a it's a fixed
 
00:40:59.230 --> 00:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
cost as for their over time in holiday
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
pay those also are done by Das as an
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
estimate based on fiscal year 25 so
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
those will be adjusted but I just wanted
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
to let you know that's a little bit
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
different than where other agencies has
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
pic have picked their numbers Das gives
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
support they just build it based on what
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
occurred in 25 and put that number there
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
I see so you're saying workman's comp in
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
25 is probably
 
00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
inaccurate that one's a that one's a
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
fixed cost
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's a fixed cost that's buil by
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
Das right but it's going from 8 and one
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
to 27 and 29 right I mean there's
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
something something's happening Mo most
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
thing so Steve is Whispering to me and
 
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just sharing with Das that Statewide
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's an overall increase in workman's
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
comp so when everybody's line in
 
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
workman's comp is going up because the
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
the overall share is more expensive
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
point it's tripling
 
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
no I mean our workman's comp is is I can
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
tell you our workman's comp is like the
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
third lowest in the country right
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
so there's something weird going on with
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
this particular line maybe you can find
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
out separately information all right and
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
let's go down to um
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
to P yeah let me ask one more and then
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take other question let's go
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
to page
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
Das again okay they're hiding all kinds
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
of expenses on
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
on yeah but most we're not seeing this
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
places pass on some more information so
 
00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.510 align:start position:0%
places pass on some more information so
in

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
24 they did receive a bill but they paid
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
it outside of New Hampshire first so it
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
would not show it would be a zero in
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
here because it did not go through the
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
budget system they paid it on their own
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
but typically it would be 25 26 and 27
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
that's what the costs typically are but
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
again they would pay them they would pay
 
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
it on their their own and it may be a
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
zero or we we'd be reimbursed for that
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
amount okay all right well when we see
 
00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
Das maybe we'll ask them about this kind
 
00:43:44.359 --> 00:43:45.270 align:start position:0%
Das maybe we'll ask them about this kind
of

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
thing okay all right representative
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
camell if if you look look down here
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
there's no come for the salaries so I
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
to well then it that would be for 24 and
 
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
CH yeah we'll find out okay uh
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative cell thank you Mr chair
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh do the revenues ever exceed your
 
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
expenses do you do you have good periods
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
where you can actually make uh more
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
money than you than you need yeah yes we
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
do and what that would be done is that
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
kept in in in our Enterprise fund that
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
would basically uh Foster Capital
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
Improvements or Capital replacement okay
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't go back to like a general
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
fund you you keep it and you use it for
 
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
improvements correct we utilize it for
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements uh potentially
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
anything from a Federal grant uh local
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor sponsorship uh portion of a of a
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
grant um or we we reinvested into the
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
facility whether it's fixed assets or um
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know Capital needs okay and the
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
opposite of that if the revenues are
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
down and less than uh than what you
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated uh how do you make up the
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
the Delta to to pay your expenses
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
fortunately I'm I'm proud of the team
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
that we we manage um fiscally
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
responsible we haven't been in that
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
position um we hope not to be in that
 
00:45:25.549 --> 00:45:25.559 align:start position:0%
position but uh we work very closely on
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
uh on our operating budget uh on a on a
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
monthly report to our PDA board um and
 
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
then staff works at at it continuously
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're not in that
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
position um and any of those Capital
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
Improvements would be the first things
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
that we we would scale back on if we saw
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
that uh we're we're unable to sustain
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
our oam and our operating um and
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance budget thank you you're
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Evo yeah um hi
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
good morning so um is your primary
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
revenue Source your fees corrected
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
specifically the warpage and dockage
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
fees at Market Street Terminal the heavy
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
the heavy Maritime uh lifts and um do
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
you have the authority to adjust those
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
fees yourself we do it is a public
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
process um we you know we we also have
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
to gauge the the competitive market
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
around us um and also uh recognize um
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
what our limitations are with the
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure specifically there's
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
three Three brid Bridges um on the
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
catore that impact what type of vessels
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
we can can take at at Market Street so
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of knowing your you
 
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
know your infrastructure and what you
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
can provide our commercial entities um
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
and also gauging the local market and
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
what their price points
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
are some some fees for some agencies are
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
statutorily set and they haven't been
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
changed for a long time so I was just
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
curious what your situation yeah we and
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
at the smaller uh facilities right now
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
we're actually um have done quite an
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
extensive review increasing those that
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
were stagnant for some time um we think
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
they're fair and reasonable and the
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
first thing we do is is look at other
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
entities at at the state and for
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
instance uh public parking at our
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
facilities is is a fee uh structure and
 
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
we try to pair that with um what we're
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
seeing the parks department and
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
Municipal um beaches and other
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
facilities charge and and be on a Level
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
Playing Field with
 
00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:25.559 align:start position:0%
that all right so we just got this um
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
report on your Airport dedicated fund
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
and it's been growing um significantly
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like can you just walk us
 
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
through I guess the last year was was
 
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:39.620 align:start position:0%
relatively flat but
 
00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:41.349 align:start position:0%
relatively flat but
[Music]

00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah so over the last few years we
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
did receive some covid funding um and so
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
it has grown our cash balances but we've
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
got some significant Capital
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures that we're anticipating um
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
at the are airport and so we're actually
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
now just working on our capital budget
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
and um so I anticipate that over the
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
next couple of years you're going to see
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
this uh fund be much lower but yes it
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
has grown and that's really what it's
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
been it's
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
been uh an influx of some of that that
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
covid funding and
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
um maybe not some some of the maybe not
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
some larger internally funded projects
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
but we've got some um on the horizon
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
that are going to be internally funded
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
that are PR significant you can so when
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between what you
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
put in the expenses line and in the
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
other uses line that's really the that
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
really take that's the increase or
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
decrease in our receivables and our
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
grant funding um and
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
um um
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
because I'm trying to think what else
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
could drive that yeah so we're looking
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
at a point in time um when we're putting
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
this together so that usually represents
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
an increase and decrease in pay lables
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
related to um Grant receipts coming in
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
or Grant receipts going out and they can
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
be pretty significant especially like
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
2024 when we had our terminal Expansion
 
00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:11.799 align:start position:0%
Project going so when this was pre was
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
prepared we could have had a grant
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement coming in for a couple
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars versus in Prior years
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
when there was not a lot of big projects
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
going and in that tracks with 2021 that
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
was the year that we had reconstructed
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
our 11,000 ft Runway uh to the tune of
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
just under $20 million so um the timing
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
of the grant reimbursement and the grant
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
allocation uh triggers that large 5.5
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
million doll other services do you have
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
a bond for that kind of stuff with the
 
00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:44.119 align:start position:0%
exception of at the onset of the PDA we
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
have not bonded um I'm proud to say that
 
00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh We Want To Be A bank's worst worst
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
customer um and we're very calculated um
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
we had a it was a decent deal with the
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
with the US government on the transfer
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of outdated um buildings
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure that are coming on to
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
market now um and we do anticipate for
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
instance we have to rehabilitate our air
 
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
traffic controller which is uh a state a
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
state asset we have to air traffic
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
control tower facility build the actual
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
building has to be uh rehabilitated uh

Rehabilitation um that that is a primary
 
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
egress out to the runway um you you're
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with such a large volume of
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
pavement um was Circa 1950s Era
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
construction that it it is coming due
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
and and we anticipate a large um Capital
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
Pro Plan for for rehabilitation

representative

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
W I'm on the Sky Haven airport advisory
 
00:50:43.789 --> 00:50:43.799 align:start position:0%
commission I'm surprised you didn't
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
mention that that's one of your
 
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um you also spend a
 
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:51.799 align:start position:0%
fair amount of money there or is that
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
just what we get from the feds no we we
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
personally um we we we we do put uh
 
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
extensive Revenue into Sky Haven um we
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
believe it's an incredible general
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
aviation facility um that has great
 
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
economic contribution to the local
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
region in in Rochester and summersworth
 
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately there there is some
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
competing entities uh for Aviation
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
around the area um but because of uh
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
what I would call uh economy of scale um
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
that we have very talented Prof
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
professionals at Portsmouth
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
International Airport that are able to
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
put their resources to work at Sky Haven
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
for engineering environmental airport
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
planning um so we do contribute uh
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
directly to Sky Haven um and we are now
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
starting to to to be able to get a
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of a Enterprise fund there to
 
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
put back in into rehabilit
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating facilities and just for
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
the committee should understand that Sky
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
Haven airport was also transferred to
 
00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
the PDA approximately
 
00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
uh mid
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
mid90s um it was a private airport that
 
00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
uh was transferred in in to the New
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dot division of Aeronautics
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
and then uh essentially it was
 
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
transferred to the peace Development
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
Authority and I I'm proud of the product
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
up there and uh we hope that it
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
continues to support the the businesses
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh in in the community in that area we
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
tried to get Rochester to take it over
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
but they were unwilling
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you were the next y but it seems to
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
work out right we have you have one
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
employee we see
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
regularly thank you and thank you for
 
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.069 align:start position:0%
regularly thank you and thank you for
your

00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
service all right other
 
00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.270 align:start position:0%
service all right other
questions

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
no all right yeah I'm oh I'm sorry
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
representative lean I didn't see you Mr
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
chairman so a number of years ago the
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
state was uh providing some funds and a
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
bond was taken out to support some
 
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
improvements that's all been paid off it
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
has yes okay
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
I believe the totality was $10 million
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
and it has been paid
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh many decade many years ago okay
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
thanks that's what I thought I just want
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
to make sure thanks so what fraction of
 
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
the 17 million the airport gets every
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
year comes from the federal
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
government uh it will so there's two
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
types of Grant funds that we will'll
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
receive we'll receive entitlement um
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's basically uh because of the the
 
00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
number of Passenger Employments that we
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
have uh that are commercial that that is
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
about 1 Point for $1.6 million annually
 
00:53:30.789 --> 00:53:30.799 align:start position:0%
that we'll get because of the numers of
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
people that utilize the airport and then
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
we have discretionary and certain bill
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
or oper type projects specifically um we
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
had a terminal Federal uh terminal
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
Improvement to update our passenger
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
screening our baggage screening um and
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
those can can fluctuate fortunately
 
00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation uh the
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
legislature and in and the governor's
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
office uh usually give us a lot of
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
support when we go after a grant but it
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
can vary from from year to year um but
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
some years we'll only we'll only
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
recognize that entitlement fund and
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
other years if there's a specific car
 
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:10.799 align:start position:0%
vote that the FAA is trying to promote
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
specifically improving air tra traffic
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
control Towers they may come up with a
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
specific grant for that type of program
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
and and we certainly would apply and see
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
how we we gauge throughout the country
 
00:54:21.789 --> 00:54:21.799 align:start position:0%
for getting that that money but it
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
varies from year to year so there's no
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
regular payments from the national
 
00:54:26.119 --> 00:54:26.990 align:start position:0%
regular payments from the national
government

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
or is that the 1.5 million no that's
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
from the FAA we operate under a joint
 
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
use agreement with the Air National
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
Guard Department of Defense and
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
essentially that's a cost share um
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
specifically um we we we signed a
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
prenuptual ag agreement when we got the
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
when we received the property um and and
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
really the key component with the
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense sh is they provide
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
the aircraft firefighting and Rescue
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
Services at peas they also Supply the
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
labor the air traffic control Personnel
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
the the the controllers the peas
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
Development Authority State of New
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we we are responsible for the
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
operating and maintenance of the
 
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:10.839 align:start position:0%
Airfield um in the airport so um we
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
identify that those costs over set I
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to stand up a fire
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
department and support the labor and the
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
resources that have to do with that and
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
they likely wouldn't want to be
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for removing snow um on the
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
on the runway when they need to be
 
00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
operational for their mission so we
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
believe it's a good balance and it's a
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
good deal for both the federal
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
government and the state so the bulk of
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
this is local commercial stuff right I
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
mean the of the 17
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
million it's almost all correct it's the
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
ground it primarily it's the ground
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
leases that the the non- aeronautical
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
buildings have generated for instance
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
six hour facility lans's facilities the
 
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
business park it's those ground leases
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
that are being paid to the peas
 
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
Development Authority that is going back
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
into our Enterprise fund that directly
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
supports my labor costs my my Capital
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
Investments my future Capital
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
Investments and obviously anytime that
 
00:56:05.069 --> 00:56:05.079 align:start position:0%
we have an opportunity to get Federal
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
funding we will put an application in
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
and try to uh utilize money from the
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
from the federal airport transfer fund
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation those leases are probably
 
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
long-term correct the majority of if if
 
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
if we have a developer that's building
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh or a company that's building a
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
substantial building we'll try to
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
amortise that as as long as we can the
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
FAA has rules on how long that can be so
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
it's not lay disposal um but we try to
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
maximize that and and we get we end up
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
getting a very good building on site is
 
00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:37.039 align:start position:0%
there much empty land for new commercial
 
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
property or not for non- aeronautical
 
00:56:40.589 --> 00:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
there's not we're down to about four
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
Parcels uh the easy ones were done first
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
and the other ones are challenging as
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
far as site development um so we have
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
four Parcels remaining that could
 
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
potentially be non- aeronautical use um
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
potentially in the future we could be
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
more dense you know uh our buildings
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
could could be higher or expanded that's
 
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
a policy decision representative W um
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
where where do the employees at peas
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
like all the firefighters and all that
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
where are they listed so again the the
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
the fire department would be under the
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense we get that
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
service as a joint use agreement cost
 
00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.069 align:start position:0%
service as a joint use agreement cost
share

00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
agreement U my staff peace Development
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
Authority staff is more maintenance um
 
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.829 align:start position:0%
Authority staff is more maintenance um
equipment

00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
operators um what we call airport
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
operations agent security agents um so
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
that's in our onm completely self-funded
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
by the airport um no impact to to your
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
general ledger they're not uh classified
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
or non-classified they're PDA employees
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
um and we sell fund all all Every salary
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
associated with the airport a few years
 
00:57:47.549 --> 00:57:47.559 align:start position:0%
ago I remember something before fiscal
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
that sticks in my mind because we were
 
00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
hiring fire
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
firefighters for a part of a year and
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
their benefits were greater than their
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
pay which got my attention but I it most
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
likely that was under the New Hampshire
 
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
Inter National Guards uh budget and
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
several years ago that was a New
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire International Guard expense
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
those that fire department has has
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
transferred to responsibility Department
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
of Defense Pentagon level um which is a
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
good story for the state as well and the
 
00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
commitment that the feds have made in
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
into peace thank you I wondered what now
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you do you may see that that on
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
agency I noticed anyways um yeah so if
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
everybody if you look at the um airport
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
fund dedicated fund and see where it
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
says accounting unit just above the
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
table and it says off book so that means
 
00:58:46.829 --> 00:58:46.839 align:start position:0%
it's not in the
 
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
book that's what he's talking about yes
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
right okay um any other questions no all
 
00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
right well our next one's not scheduled
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming thank you um our

00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
11:15 um so I guess we have a 20 minute
 
00:59:06.079 --> 00:59:07.789 align:start position:0%
11:15 um so I guess we have a 20 minute
break

00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
break
 
00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%

Advocate is that right yeah is advocate

for special come on up all right so for
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
some reason we only have 15 minutes to
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
here so please introduce yourself oh we
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
have this whole present we so we
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
probably won't have time to go over this
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
thing I saw this
 
01:18:59.709 --> 01:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
yesterday I will good morning Kristen
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
manani Office of the advocate for
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
special education and my colleague Tim
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
Lenahan is here with me as well okay so
 
01:19:12.189 --> 01:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
when we see your budget it's so I'm on
 
01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
page 109 here um it's one person which I
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
assume is you and then there's one big
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
temp that's full-time and that's you is
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
that right yes yes okay uh
 
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
um What's the diff why are we having a
 
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
full-time temp as opposed to a full-time
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
person um we really shouldn't the office
 
01:19:36.910 --> 01:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
was um just launched kind of when we
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
were already into the current uh budget
 
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
cycle I came on um in the summer of
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
2023 um so we didn't have any input into
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
the budget or um you know the creation
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
of these positions for fulfilling the
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
statutory duties um there was an
 
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
assumption just to give a little bit of
 
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
History um when I joined and and um even
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office Governor
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
sununu at that point there was an
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
assumption that we had a handful of
 
01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
staff to hire and I was pushed you know
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
constantly to get that process going
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
with hiring staff um we had some
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
positions approved redesigned after um a
 
01:20:24.189 --> 01:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
few months that I was in office uh
 
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
interview for them they were advertised
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
through HR um when it came time to
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
actually make offers it was discovered
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
that with the salary scales Etc we
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
didn't actually have the funding for the
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
positions um
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
so we talked to you know there there are
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
lots of people who would be qualified to
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
join us um we are we did ask in
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
prioritize needs for funding for um a
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
staff of six for the office and what I
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
did in today's presentation was actually
 
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
scale that back to say funding for a
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
staff of five
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
myself Mr Lenahan full-time um and not
 
01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
temp uh and then three other positions
 
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to just discuss that
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
briefly um with the presentation you
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
have in front of
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
you um yeah it's very unlikely you know
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're so short of money that add
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
to the governor's budget is is
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
unrealistic I do understand that what I
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
would emphasize and and what I've said
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
throughout this is that I you know we're
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
asking for positions that have we we are
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
not asking for an office manager we're
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
not asking for secretaries we are not
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
asking for the pr or marketing that some
 
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
small agencies also have we are asking
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
solely for people to do the work case
 
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
managers um three for the
 
01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:55.719 align:start position:0%
32,000 students with IEPs in the state
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
um our requests for help went up to
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
about 300 we get on average requests for
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
help with
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
30 situations a month 30 to 40 um we are
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
also pretty actively Consulting with the
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
legislature at their request and you
 
01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.390 align:start position:0%
legislature at their request and you
know

01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
advancing uh suggestions ourselves with
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
regard to how the system of special
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
education um can be improved for both
 
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.510 align:start position:0%
education um can be improved for both
accountability

01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
and throughout this presentation I've
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
talked about cost efficiencies that we
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
can achieve just by having the minimum
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
Staffing that that we need to do the job
 
01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
um the state is spending and I'm I'm
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
sure everyone's heard this discussed um
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
you know more than $900 million on
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
special education it's a um definite Hot
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
Topic we're willing to be very costc
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
conscious we've taken a really
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
systemwide approach to looking at um how
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
with less when it benefits the student
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
um we have certainly been in positions
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
to advocate for um less Staffing on
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of a parent and student um but
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
we're we're on the ground we're in the
 
01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
field doing the work we cannot do the
 
01:23:13.709 --> 01:23:13.719 align:start position:0%
statutory mandate which has us Data
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
Tracking doing case management and
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
resolution across the entire state of
 
01:23:23.629 --> 01:23:23.639 align:start position:0%
iep's legislative consultation you know
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
and and pieces um we can't do that with
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
two people across the entire state so
 
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
what brings you into a situation you say
 
01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
you're doing 30 to 40 IEPs a month but I
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
mean that's one 1,000th of all the IEPs
 
01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:43.639 align:start position:0%
that are that's right right so so even
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
in a year you're doing a 10 1% of all
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
IEPs right so so for most of IEPs you
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
have no you never see them right so
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's true yeah so what do you do with
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
an IEP what what what brings you into
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
the situation so we get brought into a
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
situation when um families reject or
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
partially reject the I AP that's
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
proposed by their district for the most
 
01:24:09.149 --> 01:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
part um you know I I was working alone
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
for the first year did about 40 of these
 
01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:13.639 align:start position:0%
cases um the 300 that I'm quoting there
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're not getting to all
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
of those we're trying to do intake on
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
all of them but Tim and I with other
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities Beyond just the case
 
01:24:23.709 --> 01:24:23.719 align:start position:0%
management we can't get to that many um
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
the situations are pretty dire we've
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
been triaging you know numbers of
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
situations where students are out of
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
school they've been out of school for a
 
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
year two years they're hospitalized
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
they're institutionalized we're getting
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
them out of those situations you know if
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
we had families testify we could have
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know U dozens here saying that the
 
01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
impact to their lives and their
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
children's lives has been dramatic we
 
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
would love to get you know the
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
investment in special education really
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
should be an investment in students
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
performance bringing them up to the
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
point that they can for the for um
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
30,000 I would say of the 32,000
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
students we have on IEPs it should be to
 
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
get them to the point where they can
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
function typically through the
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum um and and post graduation
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
post completion we're we are going to
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
have you know a thousand plus students
 
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
who for whom that's just not possible
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
they probably will need special
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
education services their whole lives and
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
then they will transfer to our
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
transitions into VC rehab and and you
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know Area Agency supports um we are
 
01:25:29.229 --> 01:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
for those students really trying to make
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
sure that there's an integration with
 
01:25:33.149 --> 01:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
those systems starting in high school um
 
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
so that that's efficient um and so that
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
the resources that exist there really
 
01:25:39.629 --> 01:25:39.639 align:start position:0%
get used for those students we're
 
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:41.719 align:start position:0%
getting more of them positioned for
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
employment who probably would not have
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
um again what we're looking for is
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
funding for for five positions including
 
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
the two of us so three additional
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
um to do on the ground case management
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
advise uh we're very happy to hear that
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
Doe has um in place systems for labor
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
costing um it's going to take a couple
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
of years to really roll that out but to
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
figure out by student why are the I
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
APS um costing as much as they are why
 
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
have costs risen um we have a pretty
 
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
good sense of that from just literally
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
looking at IEPs all the time but we'd
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
love to be involved in that for the
 
01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
cases we're involved in for just um
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
checks we've been collaborating with doe
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
we've been collaborating with private
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
agencies um we've done trainings for the
 
01:26:34.109 --> 01:26:34.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of special ed
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
administrators one of the priorities
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
that would be cost-saving and good for
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
students that Tim recently did a
 
01:26:42.189 --> 01:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
training on for them was when we put
 
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
students in episodes of treatment or
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
when we have court ordered placements
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
how do we keep the education in the
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment so that um
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
what's happening right now is they end
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
end up coming out of those treatment
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
episodes or you know being in court
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
ordered placements in far more
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
restrictive educational environments
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
that are also much more costly not great
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
for the student not good for the system
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
and they don't return back and that's
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
because all the right players are not
 
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
involved when the court takes over the
 
01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
placement the schools step back or when
 
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
bcbh takes over in an episode of
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
treatment the schools are stepping back
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
we're trying to prevent that from
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
happening so that um we have better
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes and and more cost-effective
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
outcomes that's one tiny measure of ways
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're getting involved systemically but
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
we need the staff to do it the statutory
 
01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
mandate can't be done with the two of
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
us C do you have any kind of statistics
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
on the the you said you've done 40 or so
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
cases over the past
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
year that those I the resulting IEPs are
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
are somehow less costly overall than
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh so as I said in a number of those
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
cases we were triaging so students were
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
home in in situations that weren't legal
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
right compensatory education was owed so
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say they're less costly we
 
01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:09.790 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say they're less costly we
have

01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:28:12.990 --> 01:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
definitely um in a number of
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
instances had step down plans again
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
because I think it's good for students
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
even as we emphasize cost so we've um
 
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
advocated in certain
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
situations uh to make sure that if a
 
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
student was if if we were trying to put
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
a student in an outplacement from the
 
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
district that it was for a limited
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
period of time subject to evaluations
 
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
you know three months out by that you
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
know different placement and that
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
everyone on the team was thinking six
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
months to a year out what do we think
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
obviously we have to rely on data but
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
where do we think the step down pieces
 
01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
are um so we're certainly working with
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
families on that I would tell you for
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
the most part um
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
we're always looking for solutions that
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
are um good for the students in the
 
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
sense that they group you know if it's
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
an individual speech pathologist why
 
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
aren't we doing some group that's
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
cost-effective it's better for the
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
student if we have two par Educators
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
look it doesn't it doesn't make sense we
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
we don't better serve students by having
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
two staff who are not as qualified as
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps the one staff member we need or
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
in some instances three so we've
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
certainly been advocating for that in
 
01:29:23.679 --> 01:29:24.709 align:start position:0%
certainly been advocating for that in
instance

01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
um it is too early I think with a lot of
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
those to say that we've We've Ended up
 
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
with IEPs that are less costly because
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
in a lot of those cases we're really
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
triaging situations that aren't legal
 
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
right we've about 10 of those had to go
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
to do process hearings to come up with
 
01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
an outcome um but we're certainly
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
looking as I said step Downs reassessing
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
families that we've been involved with
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
um hammering on progress
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
reporting which um including a piece of
 
01:29:58.109 --> 01:29:58.119 align:start position:0%
legislation being Advanced this session
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
um that would keep people better on
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
their toes with progress reporting which
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
is already a requirement but not
 
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
happening in a lot of our cases so
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
accountability um which again the hope
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
would be that brings
 
01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
students from support with an IEP
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
process down to supports with the
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered system of supports that
 
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
that are general education um
 
01:30:25.149 --> 01:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
um all right so we're running out of
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
time here so other questions you have
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
question just really quickly do you ever
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
get involved with families who think
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
that they should have an IEP um from the
 
01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
school and the school doesn't work with
 
01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
them to develop one we certainly have
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
been involved in those from time to time
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
that's the eligibility determination
 
01:30:49.709 --> 01:30:49.719 align:start position:0%
um I would tell you of the 40 that I
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned that I did in the first
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
year there were only one or two
 
01:30:57.149 --> 01:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
of those um generally it was students
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
who and families who'd been involved in
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
the IEP process for some time um in
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
those instances I would say to to the
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
question from representative Maguire
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
just Brier one of those instances a year
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the family is ready to say that the
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
services are no longer needed through
 
01:31:15.629 --> 01:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
the IEP that their student caught up it
 
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
was a student who was failing student is
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
now on the honor role um it was a
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
specific learning disability eligibility
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
they had been fighting it for three
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
years to get any kinds of services and
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
and that's they're going to be able to
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
pull off from that so yes we do work on
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility identification when it seems
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
warranted but we're also very conscious
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
of saying when when it's a limited
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
specific learning disability when when
 
01:31:44.189 --> 01:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
can those supports drop back away to a a
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
more gen Ed in general for an IEP to be
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
created do the parents have to agree to
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
it um so there is a default provision in
 
01:31:57.229 --> 01:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
the statute if if the parents don't
 
01:31:58.830 --> 01:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
agree and the school does not believe
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
they can meet the needs of the child
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
without um those IEP Services um the
 
01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.790 align:start position:0%
without um those IEP Services um the
there

01:32:07.790 --> 01:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
are they can't provide it initially
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
right so the very first time a school
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
can't force a student to become a
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
special ed student however in subsequent
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
years um if there are disagreements the
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
school suggests one thing the parent
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
disagrees or doesn't respond there are
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
ways that um Services either stay in
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
place or can be added by default by the
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
lack of parent response it can't happen
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
the very first time um so schools can't
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
force students into special
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
education all right representative
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
Griffin yeah it looks reviewing this
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
your case load increase it looks like
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
you're doing like 150 cases a year is
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
that accurate um we're probably getting
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
inquiries for close to to 300 um which
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
is that as representative McGuire said
 
01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
1% of the students who have IEP
 
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide um we cannot handle that many
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
so you know I think between the two of
 
01:33:09.629 --> 01:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
us we can each handle probably 30 to 40
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
in a year um and that's it but yes we're
 
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
getting inquiries for closer to 300 so
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
at this point 300 a year or 300 BM 300 a
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
so it takes you more than a week's worth
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
of work to deal with an
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
IEP one I mean yes yes I mean most of it
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're we're pretty Hands-On because
 
01:33:38.669 --> 01:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
these don't come to us until things have
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
broken down right that we don't get as I
 
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
said this is 1% of the 30,000 plus so
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
when the the IEP team I mean we're often
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
in a room with you know this many people
 
01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
each with different disciplines um I I I
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
don't think one meeting ever resolves
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
the cases that we get it it tends to be
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
multiple meetings moving the ball
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
forward trying to get to resolution and
 
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
that is faster and more efficient then
 
01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:11.910 align:start position:0%
that is faster and more efficient then
dispute

01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
resolution and a court process like I
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
said you know we would anticipate that
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
10% of the 1% of cases that we get
 
01:34:20.109 --> 01:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
actually need to go to a dispute
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
resolution process through doe that
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
involves tons of time for everyone um it
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
is sometimes beneficial it gets kids out
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
of hospitalization into appropriate
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
programs which by the way is actually
 
01:34:33.870 --> 01:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
less costly even though their programs
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
may be very costly it is less so than
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
institutionalization and and more
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate um yes
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
the uh just just getting through the
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
documents for a couple of years to
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
understand the case and why there's a
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
dispute would take a significant time
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
never mind the team meetings um and then
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
obviously cases that go further
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
require more so why does why does your
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
2027 is that right or is that marketing
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
no that's travel
 
01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it should we'd allocate it from
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere different both Tim and I do
 
01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:12.390 align:start position:0%
somewhere different both Tim and I do
travel

01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
travel
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
um quite a bit if you had more employees
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
would you scatter them around the state
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
um we would we'd probably try to do
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
something that was more um developed
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
towards expertise in certain areas Tim
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
tends to handle more that is a court
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
ordered placement um or episode of
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
treatment pieces he has a background as
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
a jppo whereas I handle some that are um
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
really broken down educational um
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
environments my background is more in
 
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
education uh but so we'd probably do it
 
01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
less geographically and more by subject
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
matter all right well our our time is up
 
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm going to like to ask you
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
back um at some point um maybe next week
 
01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
you all right we now have page 110 the
 
01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.629 align:start position:0%
you all right we now have page 110 the
next

01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
page very easy
 
01:36:23.719 --> 01:37:00.189 align:start position:0%
page very easy
now

01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
to take this out I'm not going to be
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
all right welcome good morning my name

01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
for you a bit about the mission of our
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
office um and I'll just Briefly
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
summarize this here for you so our
 
01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
office um was established in 2018 as
 
01:37:53.709 --> 01:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
oversight over our child welfare agency
 
01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
specifically um child welfare and
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice both DCF in 2020 we
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
received expanded jurisdiction and at
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
that time we um expanded to jurisdiction
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
over all child serving executive branch
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
agencies and any entity that contracts
 
01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
or certifies with them to provide direct
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
treatment to Children the role of our
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
office is to ensure that the best
 
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
interests of New Hampshire's children
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
are protected and a lot of the focus of
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
our work still is directly of the
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
oversight over our child welfare in
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
juven Justice agency um we do have touch
 
01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
points as well with residential
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
treatment which is housed um also a DHHS
 
01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:33.159 align:start position:0%
service but housed under the Bureau of
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health um but
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
again the majority of of the daily work
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
that we receive and do in the office is
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
tied to the oversight over our child
 
01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:44.679 align:start position:0%
welfare agency um we are fully staffed
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
in the office we have nine full-time
 
01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
positions um one is classified which is
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
my position the remainder is
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
unclassified the remainder of the the
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
positions on page three for you I have a
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
bit of data about um the incidents and
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
inquiries that our office reviews um our
 
01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
inner reporting time frame is from July
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
1st through June 30th so we match the
 
01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year cycle um within that last
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we received
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
2937 incident reports for review every
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
single one of those reports are reviewed
 
01:39:23.119 --> 01:39:23.990 align:start position:0%
single one of those reports are reviewed
in

01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
its entirety and um some of them have
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
more in-depth reviews those would be the
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
critical incident reports which um there
 
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
were 86 of them within that time
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
frame the uh 1500 there are restraint
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
and seclusion reports we do review those
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
in full and we reach out if there is an
 
01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
issue on them um the critical incident
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
reports we review we do our own internal
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
summary and we track to follow um next
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
steps for safety of those children what
 
01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
does it mean to be a critical incident
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
report yes that's a great question a
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
critical incident report is includes a
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
family that's involved with our um
 
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
department for children youth and
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
families and it is when there is an
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
issue of serious harm to a child a child
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
fatality a parent fatality um as well as
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
a serious incident um that could be out
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
in the media um and identifies that the
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
family is related to that
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
system and so we received those reports
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
directly from DCF indicating the
 
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
incident that occurred in the action
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
steps there taking to protect either the
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
child directly impacted or surviving
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
siblings if it is a child
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
fatality um citizen complaints also come
 
01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
to our office we had 349 that we managed
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
in that last fiscal year um and of those
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
349 with that means is that we respond
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
to every single one of them um some of
 
01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
them then require further casework and
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
follow up by the udman in our office
 
01:40:52.109 --> 01:40:52.119 align:start position:0%
others of those um are referral to other
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
services but all of those do require man
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
hours to respond to and we do not leave
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
any calls unanswered to our office um
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
you will see on the next slide it talks
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
about comp time earned so we changed to
 
01:41:08.589 --> 01:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
a new um management system for payroll
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
um starting on November 1st and at that
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
time um the
 
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
system oh that's sorry typo there that
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
is 2024 um within that that time frame
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
so be between November 1st and the last
 
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
pay period this is the amount of comp
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
time earned by staff throughout our
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
office and this means this is time that
 
01:41:33.149 --> 01:41:33.159 align:start position:0%
they have worked beyond their regular
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
work hours to get the work done to
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that everything is entered into
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
the system is processed and is reviewed
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
timely for the safety of children um so
 
01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
with the Staffing we have now this just
 
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
shows how we are very limited capacity
 
01:41:47.709 --> 01:41:47.719 align:start position:0%
and are putting in extra hours to ensure
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
that we get the work done so these
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
numbers are hours or days it is comp
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
time so it is not direct hours um I can
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
say for the assistant child Advocates
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
and the associate child advocate those
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
are direct hours for the legal aid there
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
are certain hours that um calculate at a
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
higher rate of a 1.5 versus a one a
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
single hour so it's harder to get the
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
breakdown of that information um so we
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
just included it as comp time earned um
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
we are working to do some internal work
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
to really bring that down to ours to
 
01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
understand what that means um but for
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
those them all the other positions other
 
01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
than a legal aid they are direct hours
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's an hourly rate okay is there uh
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
overtime in your budget we did put in
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
our prioritize need overtime for this um
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we had not had an overtime
 
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
fund prior so when we did switch over to
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
the new system the only option was to
 
01:42:42.669 --> 01:42:42.679 align:start position:0%
allow staff to collect comp
 
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
time and there's one fewer
 
01:42:49.709 --> 01:42:49.719 align:start position:0%
employee so the one fewer in our budget
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
um if you go back to the breakdown on
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
page two um we note there that our final
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
position which is an office coordinator
 
01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
position has been unfunded in in the
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
budget we had to unfund a position to be
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
able to meet our our minimum um budget
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
number given by the prior governor and
 
01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
in this Governor's budget um she
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
included funding for all positions but
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
this one position which is our office
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
coordinator we had to select a position
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
at the time to meet the the numbers so
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
we selected a position that was vacant
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
at that time that position has been
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
filled since and is critical to the
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
functions of our office manages our
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
purchasing and procurement um assists
 
01:43:31.149 --> 01:43:31.159 align:start position:0%
with the budget development and so it is
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
critical to the Daily functions of the
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
office we have added that to our
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs to seek that position
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
being refunded for our office and it is
 
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
we did move it up higher and our
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
prioritize needs because of that so if
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
you before we get to that um the
 
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
following two charts that I have for you
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
here um show the at point in time as of
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
Fe feary 18th the amount of open
 
01:43:58.030 --> 01:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
inquiries with our office right now um
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
then these are the assignments per staff
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
member how many they each are carrying
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
including myself carrying a small case
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
load of six to be able to make sure we
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
are meeting the need of our constituents
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
and then our critical incidents um open
 
01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
as of that same date there are 255 open
 
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
um and what I can share is um that the
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
reason that some of them linger longer
 
01:44:21.149 --> 01:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
particularly if it's a child fatality um
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
we are requesting information from from
 
01:44:26.669 --> 01:44:26.679 align:start position:0%
an autopsy we also review if there is
 
01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:29.719 align:start position:0%
any um legal investigation what has
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
played out with that so there are times
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
where those will linger open longer um
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
but we are still actively working on
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
them throughout that time period so
 
01:44:39.550 --> 01:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
what's your what action would you take
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
in the case of a fatality wouldn't that
 
01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
be up to the police to deal with it the
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
police do take action at time we do
 
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
review what they have done but the Child
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
Welfare agency is responsible for any
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
surviving siblings so the immediate work
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
that we are doing while we are waiting
 
01:44:56.910 --> 01:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
whatever processes may be taking place
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
whether it be law enforcement uh or um a
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
court process we are reviewing what the
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
agency has done to ensure safety of the
 
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
remaining siblings and um we are also
 
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
conducting reviews about what the
 
01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
involvement was at the time of the
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
fatality and whether there are
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations for a child welfare
 
01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
agency to do things differently in the
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
future to avoid these incidents from
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
continuing to happen so let's suppose
 
01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:23.950 align:start position:0%
continuing to happen so let's suppose
the

01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
that situation occurred that that that
 
01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
you think that whatever dcyf did in this
 
01:45:31.950 --> 01:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
case is wrong do you have the authority
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
to order them to do something different
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
or not we do not have the authority to
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
order them we make recommendations to
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
the agency we meet with the agency
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
internally and we also report out
 
01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
publicly on findings that we have if we
 
01:45:45.629 --> 01:45:45.639 align:start position:0%
are feeling that there is a serious
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
safety concern that the agency is not
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
responding to that is when we would
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
bring it to um The public's attention to
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
make sure it is very transparent and
 
01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
clear um what missteps we identified and
 
01:45:59.350 --> 01:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
what recommendations we are making and
 
01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
we also um meet with the legislature as
 
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
well around any potential legislative
 
01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
changes that could impact the safety of
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
children okay all right go ahead um so
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
yes our first prioritize need here is um
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
refunding our office coordinator
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
position um the pay and benefits that
 
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
are listed there are the pay and
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
benefits before we had the current staff
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
and their role and it was something
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who had been in the position
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
for quite some time so they were on the
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
highest end of paying benefits um we
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
have tried to work with our HR to get
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
more accurate numbers um but they do
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
they did not have them in time for this
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
presentation um but we do believe that
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
the pay and benefits for this position
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
would actually be reduced with the newer
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
position we are also asking our
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
prioritize needs for an additional
 
01:46:50.350 --> 01:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
assistant child's Advocate position
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
because of the um High case load number
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
and now leading to um longer lag times
 
01:46:58.830 --> 01:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
of getting back to folks when they're
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
calling in a concern to our office um we
 
01:47:03.149 --> 01:47:03.159 align:start position:0%
also noted that not only are the case
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
loads high but the cases have become
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
more intensive which result in us
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
meeting on them over longer periods of
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
time where when I first came into the
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
office we typically have one or two
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
meetings conclude and we would close the
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
case and move on now we have cases that
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
have been open for a year plus I see so
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
let me just tell you that you know we we
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
have no EXP money we have less than what
 
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
the governor thinks we have and so the
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
chance of of adding is is uh negligible
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh let me ask you about something in the
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
budget specifically um line page 110
 
01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:38.790 align:start position:0%
budget specifically um line page 110
class

01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
class
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
17 uh full-time employee special
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
payments do you know what that is I do
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
not know what that is actually that was
 
01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
not in the budget that we submitted that
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
came in the governor's budget and I've
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
not been able to get an answer about
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
what that is okay Melissa or Jack yeah
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
so that's time acred so once the person
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
left that's their time acral that gets
 
01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:00.189 align:start position:0%
left that's their time acral that gets
paid

01:48:00.189 --> 01:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
out but why is it both years wouldn't it
 
01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:03.629 align:start position:0%
out but why is it both years wouldn't it
just

01:48:03.629 --> 01:48:03.639 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:48:07.589 --> 01:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
year yeah I'll look into it okay fine
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
all right good now other questions from
 
01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:14.750 align:start position:0%
all right good now other questions from
committee

01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:16.629 align:start position:0%
committee

01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at your hand out here and
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
um if I can find the spot
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%

01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
complaints what is what is the
 
01:48:47.310 --> 01:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
respondant to how do you respond to
 
01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
those complaints it differs depending on
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
the complaint they are individualized um
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
what are response may look like but many
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
of times we are directly reaching out to
 
01:48:58.750 --> 01:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
the Child Welfare agency about their
 
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
work on the case and making either
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
direct recommendations to um ensure
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
safety of the children on the case or
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
asking questions about what they are
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
doing to ensure safety if it's not
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
clearly identified within their system
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
we do have direct access into their um
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
electronic case management system so we
 
01:49:17.189 --> 01:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
always start by reviewing that and what
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
they have detailed there and then we
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
will reach out to them we do then
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
respond back to the constituent caller
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
because a lot of this information is
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
confidential we cannot necessarily share
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
the direct outcome but we can share that
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
we addressed it with the agency and we
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
feel that they're now taking the
 
01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate steps to ensure
 
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
safety yes um what's the RSA that adds
 
01:49:47.229 --> 01:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
21v I have a copy here if you'd like it
 
01:49:54.669 --> 01:49:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.669 --> 01:50:02.679 align:start position:0%
questions if I may share one update if
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
you look at the final slide we are
 
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
looking at other ways in which um we
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
could reduce our budget we um have begun
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
talking with Das about the current space
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
that we have and looking to leverage
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
work from home schedules to reduce the
 
01:50:17.709 --> 01:50:17.719 align:start position:0%
amount of office space we have so that
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
we're paying less to um Das for plant
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
and property we had a reorg a on our um
 
01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
in our prioritized needs we've now
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
bumped that down um to the bottom
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
recognizing that it's not um that the
 
01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
budget is very tight and that's not
 
01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
realistic in this time frame so we are
 
01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
we are trying to get creative and look
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
at other opportunities to cost save for
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
our agency and we're planning some
 
01:50:41.069 --> 01:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
future meetings um with folks from Das
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
to come over to our space to look at
 
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
what it looks like now and how much the
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
cost saving would be to reduce to half
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
of the offices that we have currently is
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
Johnson Hall off Pleasant Street is that
 
01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
one yes yeah near labor and all those
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
people yeah okay good thank you uh
 
01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.750 align:start position:0%
people yeah okay good thank you uh
representative

01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
evil just looking at uh your statement
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
under prioritized needs it says other
 
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
line items operating expenses I mean
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
what you say here is without additional
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
funds the office will not be able to pay
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
for basic needs in order to fulfill our
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
mandates related directly to children's
 
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
safety and
 
01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.470 align:start position:0%
safety and
well-being

01:51:19.470 --> 01:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so you're really struggling to
 
01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
fulfill your mandate at this point with
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
the level of funding that you have we
 
01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
are not with the 2025 budget um that is
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
very reasonable amount that we can work
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
within if you look at the following
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
slides it actually shows you um the the
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the budget in this climate
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
and it shows that 93% of our budget in
 
01:51:47.069 --> 01:51:47.079 align:start position:0%
efficiency is paid to pay and benefits
 
01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
and so that leaves us a 2% operating
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
budget that does not allow us enough
 
01:51:52.589 --> 01:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
money to get out to see children we
 
01:51:54.069 --> 01:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
travel out of state to see children we
 
01:51:55.470 --> 01:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
travel across the state to meet with
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
them it is part of our mandate to meet
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
with them in person as needed um that
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
would greatly reduce the ability to do
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
that um we do visit uh YDC and Hamstead
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital both on a monthly basis we
 
01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
would have to cut that down
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
significantly maybe to twice a year um
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
so th it's because the op so much of our
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
our budget currently is paying benefits
 
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
that we would not have the operating
 
01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
budget like we have now um and we do
 
01:52:23.709 --> 01:52:23.719 align:start position:0%
have a a chart um on one of the
 
01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
following Pages showing what it is in
 
01:52:29.390 --> 01:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
2025 and then what the dip is um for
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
operating budget in the next
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
years which which page there's a bunch
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
of py graphs um it's after the two py
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
graph Pages the bar graph following that
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
bars I think with they're talking about
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
this here on page
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
111 um in fiscal year 25 there's 27
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
,000 of uh travel turning to to seven
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
and then five right so
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
yeah all
 
01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:03.950 align:start position:0%
yeah all
right

01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
no I don't see any more questions so
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
coming okay all right so we are going to
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
come back at 1:15 and this
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon we have um uh Dr we can ask
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
them those other questions uh State and
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
labor hopefully those are relatively
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.440 --> 01:54:21.350 align:start position:0%

03:18:58.070 --> 03:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
137 I like to get the big picture of who
 
03:19:00.710 --> 03:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
and we have commissioner steep here
 
03:19:02.150 --> 03:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
correct good afternoon Lindsay step
 
03:19:03.469 --> 03:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the Department of
 
03:19:05.510 --> 03:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration with me is
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
Shelley gerano our business
 
03:19:12.550 --> 03:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
administrator you have before you a
 
03:19:14.429 --> 03:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
presentation which I just need to pull
 
03:19:23.229 --> 03:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
okay and so just a reminder on page two
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
of the presentation what the mission of
 
03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
the department
 
03:19:30.080 --> 03:19:32.429 align:start position:0%
the department
is

03:19:32.429 --> 03:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:19:34.630 --> 03:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
we um our mission is to fairly and
 
03:19:36.389 --> 03:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
efficiently administer the tax laws of
 
03:19:37.870 --> 03:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire collecting
 
03:19:40.910 --> 03:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
the proper amount of taxes due in
 
03:19:43.030 --> 03:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
incurring the least cost to taxpayers in
 
03:19:44.550 --> 03:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
a manner that merits the highest degree
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
of public confidence in our integrity
 
03:19:48.150 --> 03:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
further we provide prompt and
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
constructive assistance to the municipal
 
03:19:51.630 --> 03:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
units of government in the matters of
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
Budget Finance and the appraisal of real
 
03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
estate page three of our presentation is
 
03:19:59.710 --> 03:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
our current fiscal year 24 fiscal year
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
25 org chart we have have
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
153 authorized full-time
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
positions 118 of those are classified 35
 
03:20:09.120 --> 03:20:09.830 align:start position:0%
positions 118 of those are classified 35
are

03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:20:11.710 --> 03:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
unclassified and then you can see the
 
03:20:13.469 --> 03:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
breakdown between our Administration
 
03:20:16.110 --> 03:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
unit so the total is the same but a few
 
03:20:17.790 --> 03:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
have moved around round is that right
 
03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
that's right you'll have one position
 
03:20:21.469 --> 03:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
that moved from the taxpayer Services
 
03:20:23.469 --> 03:20:23.479 align:start position:0%
Division and one and that moved from
 
03:20:25.590 --> 03:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer Services into collections in
 
03:20:28.710 --> 03:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 2627 budget but yes the
 
03:20:30.590 --> 03:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
total number how many of these are
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
unfunded or unfilled or we will'll get
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:40.110 --> 03:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
four so as you said Mr chair this is
 
03:20:41.349 --> 03:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
kind of the big picture of the
 
03:20:44.070 --> 03:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
department you have your fiscal year
 
03:20:46.630 --> 03:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
2024 actual expense your fiscal year
 
03:20:49.910 --> 03:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
2025 adjusted authorized and then 26 and
 
03:20:51.469 --> 03:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
27 for the
 
03:20:53.990 --> 03:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
governor the majority of our department
 
03:20:56.790 --> 03:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
is General funded um education trust
 
03:20:59.030 --> 03:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
fund money is solely for the low and
 
03:21:01.510 --> 03:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
moderate income property tax relief
 
03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
program and agency income is a
 
03:21:07.110 --> 03:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
combination of flood control which we
 
03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
pay to the municipalities who were
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
impacted by the mar the damning of the
 
03:21:13.349 --> 03:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
marac and Connecticut rivers and then
 
03:21:16.030 --> 03:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
also The Debt Service on the bonds that
 
03:21:18.670 --> 03:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
were used used to pay for our Revenue
 
03:21:20.309 --> 03:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
information management
 
03:21:22.550 --> 03:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
system so again you can see that the
 
03:21:24.590 --> 03:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
position count Remains the
 
03:21:27.630 --> 03:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
Same um from 24 all the way through
 
03:21:31.229 --> 03:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
27 I would note our general fund is 70%
 
03:21:33.710 --> 03:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits we are a department
 
03:21:36.389 --> 03:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
of people not programs or
 
03:21:38.349 --> 03:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
things you will see there is a
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
difference between fiscal year 24 actual
 
03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 25 adjusted authorized
 
03:21:47.349 --> 03:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
that's due to a a couple of things first
 
03:21:49.469 --> 03:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
at the end of fiscal year 24 we had a
 
03:21:53.349 --> 03:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate of 16 A5 per. so was 17 70%
 
03:21:55.750 --> 03:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
of our budget being salary and benefits
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
and a vacancy rate of almost
 
03:22:00.309 --> 03:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
177% there was a pretty decent impact to
 
03:22:03.670 --> 03:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
our budget as with um unfilled
 
03:22:07.269 --> 03:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
positions when you then look from 24 and
 
03:22:09.309 --> 03:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
you kind of skip 25 and you look to 26
 
03:22:12.990 --> 03:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
and 27 you will see an increase there
 
03:22:16.110 --> 03:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
that is largely due to us needing to
 
03:22:18.550 --> 03:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
operate rationalize the cost of
 
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
supporting our rims system so as a
 
03:22:25.710 --> 03:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
reminder rims was a$3 Million
 
03:22:28.110 --> 03:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
$160,000 Capital
 
03:22:31.750 --> 03:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation that Capital money is in
 
03:22:34.389 --> 03:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
the process of running out the project
 
03:22:37.389 --> 03:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
has been in place for seven years um and
 
03:22:39.750 --> 03:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
so we have known for seven years that at
 
03:22:41.309 --> 03:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
this point we will need to start
 
03:22:43.710 --> 03:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
operationalizing those expenses and
 
03:22:45.990 --> 03:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
moving those expenses from the capital
 
03:22:48.590 --> 03:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
budget into our operating budget I'll
 
03:22:50.030 --> 03:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
talk more about that when we get to
 
03:22:51.790 --> 03:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
those actual line items and explain in
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
more detail what that means thank
 
03:22:58.110 --> 03:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
you um current funded position count as
 
03:22:59.309 --> 03:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
we mentioned is
 
03:23:02.030 --> 03:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
153 the efficiency request that we put
 
03:23:05.750 --> 03:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
forward would fund 135 positions that
 
03:23:08.750 --> 03:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
was uh almost 12% reduction the
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
governor's budget funds
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
129 positions so we um the governor's
 
03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
budget is a 15
 
03:23:22.429 --> 03:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
7% reduction in our funded positions all
 
03:23:25.389 --> 03:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
of those positions that are unfunded are
 
03:23:25.399 --> 03:23:27.670 align:start position:0%
of those positions that are unfunded are
currently

03:23:27.670 --> 03:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:23:30.269 --> 03:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
vacant okay moving on to page five
 
03:23:32.070 --> 03:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
before just a couple so there there's a
 
03:23:34.349 --> 03:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
a handful of vacant ones that are that
 
03:23:36.070 --> 03:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
are funded correct and we're going to
 
03:23:38.510 --> 03:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
talk about those in detail um when we
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
get to those accounting units so before
 
03:23:42.510 --> 03:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
we go through each of the accounting
 
03:23:45.990 --> 03:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
units um I just wanted to say that I
 
03:23:48.150 --> 03:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
will not note as the chair requested any
 
03:23:49.950 --> 03:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
remaining vacant positions that are
 
03:23:52.070 --> 03:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
funded in the governor's budget we'll go
 
03:23:53.910 --> 03:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
through those I'm also going to
 
03:23:56.550 --> 03:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
highlight other non salary and benefit
 
03:24:00.710 --> 03:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
changes between 24 25 26 and
 
03:24:03.750 --> 03:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
27 um I have included as the chair
 
03:24:05.710 --> 03:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
requested some areas for additional
 
03:24:08.670 --> 03:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
savings that are Beyond salary and
 
03:24:11.469 --> 03:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
benefits spoiler alert they're small but
 
03:24:13.429 --> 03:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
I did we did scrub the budget and tried
 
03:24:16.910 --> 03:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
to find everything that we could um
 
03:24:20.550 --> 03:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
what you'll see on page five before we
 
03:24:23.309 --> 03:24:23.319 align:start position:0%
get into the individual accounting units
 
03:24:25.630 --> 03:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
these are areas um current expense
 
03:24:27.510 --> 03:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
equipment training and instate and out
 
03:24:31.590 --> 03:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
of state travel we um made changes to
 
03:24:33.309 --> 03:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
all of these areas in all of the
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
accounting units so rather than talking
 
03:24:37.990 --> 03:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
about them repetitively I just kind of
 
03:24:40.429 --> 03:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to preface up front you will see
 
03:24:42.830 --> 03:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
a reduction in class 20 in current
 
03:24:45.030 --> 03:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
expense across many of the accounting
 
03:24:47.189 --> 03:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
units and that is due to just having
 
03:24:50.110 --> 03:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
fewer employees and also reducing our
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
postage um because of the repeal of the
 
03:24:55.110 --> 03:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax you will see
 
03:24:56.550 --> 03:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
across all the accounting units a
 
03:24:59.830 --> 03:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
reduction in equipment um we upgraded
 
03:25:02.590 --> 03:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
our fleet of cars that we use for our
 
03:25:04.189 --> 03:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
Municipal and property division our
 
03:25:06.510 --> 03:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
audit division and our collections
 
03:25:09.469 --> 03:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
division we did that in 24 and
 
03:25:12.269 --> 03:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
25 um so our Fleet is modern they are
 
03:25:15.349 --> 03:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
hybrid vehicles so we anticipate fewer
 
03:25:18.349 --> 03:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
repair costs and fewer um less money
 
03:25:21.550 --> 03:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
spent on gas we also decreased training
 
03:25:24.309 --> 03:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
and travel um so these amounts were
 
03:25:27.110 --> 03:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
right sized due to the reduction in the
 
03:25:29.950 --> 03:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
number of employees so that's across all
 
03:25:31.309 --> 03:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
of the accounting units and again just
 
03:25:33.389 --> 03:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
to be efficient I wanted to cover them
 
03:25:33.399 --> 03:25:36.269 align:start position:0%
to be efficient I wanted to cover them
up

03:25:36.269 --> 03:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:39.630 --> 03:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
front so if you want to go back to page
 
03:25:43.550 --> 03:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
126 Mr chair if you're ready okay you
 
03:25:46.269 --> 03:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
can kind of start at the top this is or
 
03:25:50.030 --> 03:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
organized in order by accounting unit
 
03:25:54.110 --> 03:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
and hopefully I hit on um any of the
 
03:25:57.070 --> 03:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
significant changes so first is the
 
03:25:59.630 --> 03:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
administration accounting
 
03:26:04.510 --> 03:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
unit first class to note is class 22
 
03:26:08.030 --> 03:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
you'll see an increase there um this is
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
rental for our multifunction printers we
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
moved the payment from one printer that
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
was being paid out of taxpayer services
 
03:26:16.830 --> 03:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
and we moved it into administ
 
03:26:19.830 --> 03:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
so it's a reduction in One AU and an
 
03:26:23.189 --> 03:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
increase in another in class 26 this is
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
just an anticipated year-over-year
 
03:26:27.349 --> 03:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
increase in membership dues for National
 
03:26:30.630 --> 03:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
Organ organizations that we utilize um
 
03:26:32.429 --> 03:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
as tax administrators and also
 
03:26:34.269 --> 03:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
Cooperative audit programs why don't we
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
skip numbers less than a 100,000 just to
 
03:26:41.750 --> 03:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
sure um unless we ask about them but you
 
03:26:44.630 --> 03:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
know I'm more interested in class 27
 
03:26:46.750 --> 03:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
sure let's talk about class 27
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned we need to
 
03:26:55.469 --> 03:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
operationalize um the the costs for
 
03:26:59.630 --> 03:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
rims and as I said this has been coming
 
03:27:03.670 --> 03:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
for a number of years um we knew that we
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
would need to do this it's
 
03:27:08.070 --> 03:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
understandably I understand it somewhat
 
03:27:09.750 --> 03:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunate given the budget picture
 
03:27:10.830 --> 03:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
that this would be the year that we
 
03:27:13.229 --> 03:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
would need to start um absorbing these
 
03:27:16.510 --> 03:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
costs but it is what it is in terms of
 
03:27:19.630 --> 03:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
timing so these are ongoing payments to
 
03:27:22.870 --> 03:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
the vendor for for maintenance and and
 
03:27:26.710 --> 03:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
service or is it um still paying off the
 
03:27:30.429 --> 03:27:30.439 align:start position:0%
equipment so and software good question
 
03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
so it is let's see one two three four
 
03:27:33.840 --> 03:27:35.469 align:start position:0%
so it is let's see one two three four
five

03:27:35.469 --> 03:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
five
 
03:27:38.830 --> 03:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
things um first we currently have
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
Hardware um and we are currently paying
 
03:27:43.429 --> 03:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
Hardware support that is physical
 
03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
Hardware that sits at 27 Hazen drive and
 
03:27:48.830 --> 03:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
is at end of life so we will be
 
03:27:51.389 --> 03:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
transitioning to the
 
03:27:54.630 --> 03:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
cloud and the amounts to do that um are
 
03:27:59.030 --> 03:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
included in here we also have
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
Baseline vendor support and or I should
 
03:28:03.790 --> 03:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
say software support this is your
 
03:28:06.630 --> 03:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
patches um your just ongoing support
 
03:28:08.750 --> 03:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
associated with running the
 
03:28:11.910 --> 03:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
software then we have um additional
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
support that we um utilize in the form
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
of time and material materials so the
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
vendor has packaged support they call it
 
03:28:23.790 --> 03:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
level two support or level three
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
support we decided not to opt into a set
 
03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
level of support because I wanted to be
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
confident that we were getting what we
 
03:28:37.189 --> 03:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
were paying for and you don't always get
 
03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
what you pay for when you pick a
 
03:28:42.790 --> 03:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
prepackaged um software support so we
 
03:28:45.670 --> 03:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
instead utilize a time and materials so
 
03:28:49.510 --> 03:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
we only pay for the services that we
 
03:28:52.710 --> 03:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
receive and so these are um it's an
 
03:28:54.710 --> 03:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
hourly rate for the individuals that
 
03:28:56.510 --> 03:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
provide the
 
03:28:59.990 --> 03:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
services we have been in the process of
 
03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
decreasing the amount of people that we
 
03:29:06.429 --> 03:29:06.439 align:start position:0%
utilize um when the project was in Full
 
03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
full swing there were 30 vendors on site
 
03:29:10.830 --> 03:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
every day um as I think I mentioned
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
previously they moved here they moved
 
03:29:14.590 --> 03:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
here with their families they lived here
 
03:29:16.150 --> 03:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
in conquered in the surrounding town
 
03:29:19.590 --> 03:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
pounds once the project was over we
 
03:29:22.710 --> 03:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
started decreasing um we went down to 8
 
03:29:25.070 --> 03:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
we are currently at six and this budget
 
03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
has us at four so I have done what I can
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
in order to reduce the number um I will
 
03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
also say that this vendor has been great
 
03:29:38.070 --> 03:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
to work with in terms of cross trining
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
and knowledge transfer to our embedded
 
03:29:43.309 --> 03:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
doit staff um so we have our own staff
 
03:29:44.910 --> 03:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
working on the project as well so we're
 
03:29:47.910 --> 03:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
not solely relying in on vendor support
 
03:29:49.389 --> 03:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
um we're making sure that our people
 
03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
know um how the software runs as well
 
03:29:56.070 --> 03:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
can your new can local staff make
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
feature changes or is that only the time
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
and materials kind of thing so what the
 
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
time and materials cover so the level
 
03:30:04.710 --> 03:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
run support as I said will cover the
 
03:30:07.550 --> 03:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
patches and you know the usually twice a
 
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
year for this vendor um and then what
 
03:30:15.229 --> 03:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
the time and materials will cover is um
 
03:30:17.189 --> 03:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
they will assist us we will do it
 
03:30:19.469 --> 03:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
cooperatively with any request to the
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
functionality so if we need things
 
03:30:25.790 --> 03:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
changed um that's done in consultation
 
03:30:27.950 --> 03:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
and working alongside with the vendor
 
03:30:30.590 --> 03:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
when we need to do an upgrade which we
 
03:30:32.070 --> 03:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
don't because we just upgraded but in
 
03:30:33.429 --> 03:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
the future when we need to do an upgrade
 
03:30:35.229 --> 03:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
that's when you really need to pull in
 
03:30:37.670 --> 03:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
the vendor to do much of that
 
03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
work okay um and then the only there's
 
03:30:41.429 --> 03:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
two other small things just to be
 
03:30:42.990 --> 03:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
thorough that are included in this
 
03:30:47.070 --> 03:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
amount um we do pay the vendor $50,000 a
 
03:30:50.229 --> 03:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
year for 24/7 monitoring it's a tax
 
03:30:52.070 --> 03:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
system we want people to be able to make
 
03:30:53.950 --> 03:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
payments when they want to make payments
 
03:30:55.229 --> 03:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
even if it's the on the middle of a
 
03:30:58.030 --> 03:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
night on a Saturday night um so we pay
 
03:30:59.550 --> 03:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
the vendor to make sure our system is up
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
at all times and we also utilize um the
 
03:31:05.710 --> 03:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
vendor for a data subscription um to
 
03:31:08.189 --> 03:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
assist us with correcting um wrong
 
03:31:10.189 --> 03:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
addresses um so we can make sure that we
 
03:31:12.830 --> 03:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
get the information out to the
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers do you know that more than 50
 
03:31:20.750 --> 03:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
,000 in taxes comes in between 8:00 p.m.
 
03:31:22.389 --> 03:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
and 8:00 a.m. or something like that you
 
03:31:24.750 --> 03:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
know what I mean I actually I should
 
03:31:26.510 --> 03:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
look at that it probably would depend on
 
03:31:29.550 --> 03:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
the on the day of the month I imagine um
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
right before the 15th there's fair
 
03:31:34.590 --> 03:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
amount of of things that happen a lot of
 
03:31:37.990 --> 03:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
folks um I think the taxpayers that most
 
03:31:39.910 --> 03:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate making sure that they can
 
03:31:41.630 --> 03:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
make payments 24 hours a day or our
 
03:31:43.429 --> 03:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals operators they're
 
03:31:45.590 --> 03:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
making a payment every month restaurant
 
03:31:47.189 --> 03:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
might not closed till 10: p.m. and
 
03:31:48.429 --> 03:31:48.439 align:start position:0%
they're sitting there doing the books
 
03:31:51.870 --> 03:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
after that so okay very good um so that
 
03:31:56.030 --> 03:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
is is the largest um increase now in
 
03:31:58.630 --> 03:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
2024 are you saying there was some still
 
03:32:01.269 --> 03:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
some capital budget money that went into
 
03:32:03.790 --> 03:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
that correct so there was still Capital
 
03:32:06.070 --> 03:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
Money in 24 there's a little bit of
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
capital money in 25 it's really 26 and
 
03:32:13.710 --> 03:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
27 where we're full operationalizing so
 
03:32:15.630 --> 03:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
we've been spending 6 and5 million a
 
03:32:18.229 --> 03:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
year on these items for a long time
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
correct even more than that because our
 
03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
time in materials I was at eight people
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
and I was at six people this is four
 
03:32:25.830 --> 03:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
gotcha so yeah we've been spending even
 
03:32:28.670 --> 03:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
even more than that all right thank
 
03:32:28.680 --> 03:32:30.389 align:start position:0%
even more than that all right thank
you

03:32:30.389 --> 03:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:32:35.150 --> 03:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
um other changes within
 
03:32:38.790 --> 03:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
Administration uh line 43 line 43 Debt
 
03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
Service so um this is on the bottom
 
03:32:43.550 --> 03:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
bullet of page six so these are
 
03:32:45.910 --> 03:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
principal and interest payments on the
 
03:32:48.429 --> 03:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
bonds that were used to fund rims so
 
03:32:53.150 --> 03:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
again $30 M60 th000 6 million of that
 
03:32:54.630 --> 03:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
principal and interest was paid by the
 
03:32:58.189 --> 03:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
general fund the remaining
 
03:32:58.199 --> 03:32:59.710 align:start position:0%
general fund the remaining
$4,160

03:32:59.710 --> 03:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
$4,160
 
03:33:03.710 --> 03:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
th000 is paid for through Revenue uplift
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
from rims so we at the department
 
03:33:10.269 --> 03:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
transfer up to $4 million a year a
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
revenue uplift into a dedicated fund
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
that's used to pay the principal and
 
03:33:18.189 --> 03:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
interest so you will see in class 43 The
 
03:33:20.950 --> 03:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
Debt Service amounts if you move
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
down to 99 agency income you'll see
 
03:33:27.870 --> 03:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
those amounts are offset 100% so the
 
03:33:31.389 --> 03:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
agency income is the dedicated fund
 
03:33:34.990 --> 03:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
paying The Debt Service of class
 
03:33:37.990 --> 03:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
43 oh I see and those amounts are given
 
03:33:40.469 --> 03:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
to us by treasury based on the bond
 
03:33:43.110 --> 03:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
schedule um that they issued and the and
 
03:33:45.790 --> 03:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
the reason that this B anum's numbers
 
03:33:48.269 --> 03:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
are so much bigger than last is because
 
03:33:49.630 --> 03:33:49.640 align:start position:0%
some of these bonds have just been
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
issued correct so they right they issue
 
03:33:54.349 --> 03:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
the bonds my understanding is that they
 
03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
issue the bonds in in the time timely
 
03:33:59.550 --> 03:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
manner to make the payments yes so yes
 
03:34:02.070 --> 03:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
we have there are more bonds that are
 
03:34:03.790 --> 03:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
requiring principle and interest this by
 
03:34:08.110 --> 03:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
you um if you look at class 46 you will
 
03:34:15.269 --> 03:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
see nothing um in fiscal year 24 you'll
 
03:34:17.229 --> 03:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
see almost half a million dollars in 25
 
03:34:19.750 --> 03:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
and then a dollar in 26 and 27 this is
 
03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
the removal of one of the Consultants
 
03:34:26.790 --> 03:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
that we were using um for rims so there
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
was no cost in 24 we have some money
 
03:34:31.150 --> 03:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
budgeted in 25 but then it's essentially
 
03:34:34.469 --> 03:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
eliminated in 26 and 27 as we reduced
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
the number that was necessary
 
03:34:42.269 --> 03:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
gotcha um any other lines that you want
 
03:34:46.429 --> 03:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
to cover in the administration unit
 
03:34:49.469 --> 03:34:49.479 align:start position:0%
it no I think the only other one I guess
 
03:34:51.429 --> 03:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
worth noting is the transfers uh class
 
03:34:54.150 --> 03:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
89 the transfers to the D maintenance
 
03:34:58.150 --> 03:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
fund that's something new in 26 and
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
89 oh so okay what's that so those are
 
03:35:10.030 --> 03:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
amounts given to us um by D I believe
 
03:35:11.990 --> 03:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
because we are in a building that's
 
03:35:14.349 --> 03:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
owned by Das and we're paying rent this
 
03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
is the establishment of a m main fund
 
03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
gotta so that is something new okay and
 
03:35:24.269 --> 03:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
then on page seven just to cover the um
 
03:35:26.510 --> 03:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
there's two positions well one directly
 
03:35:30.590 --> 03:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
in an ad in the administration unit um
 
03:35:32.309 --> 03:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
and one that's a path pass through from
 
03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
doit but we have two positions that are
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
funded in the governor's budget but are
 
03:35:40.590 --> 03:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
currently vacant I'll skip to the um
 
03:35:42.830 --> 03:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
business systems analyst I believe
 
03:35:45.030 --> 03:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner goule um when he spoke to
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
you the other day mentioned this
 
03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
position I believe he is in support of
 
03:35:51.710 --> 03:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
unfund of um unfund that position it is
 
03:35:53.910 --> 03:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
currently vacant and we would Echo that
 
03:35:56.510 --> 03:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
sentiment we're fine to unfund that
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
position the paralal um as I mentioned
 
03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
here on the slide this is the only paral
 
03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
paralal in our legal Bureau our legal
 
03:36:07.990 --> 03:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau is two attorneys so as I like to
 
03:36:10.189 --> 03:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
say they're kind of lean and mean for uh
 
03:36:13.229 --> 03:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
a Revenue Agency um the position became
 
03:36:16.229 --> 03:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
vacant in the fall we did some initial
 
03:36:19.110 --> 03:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
recruitment which was not successful um
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
we have since pulled down the
 
03:36:22.750 --> 03:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
recruitment um and would like to
 
03:36:24.750 --> 03:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
consider reposting that position in the
 
03:36:26.349 --> 03:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
spring when we get a waiver from the
 
03:36:28.189 --> 03:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
governor's office it is a pretty
 
03:36:30.990 --> 03:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
critical position um and so I would
 
03:36:33.950 --> 03:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
request that that one remain funded if
 
03:36:33.960 --> 03:36:38.269 align:start position:0%
request that that one remain funded if
possible

03:36:38.269 --> 03:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:41.389 --> 03:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
yeah okay just to be sure thorough on
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
page eight oh sorry so there's a
 
03:36:45.910 --> 03:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
business analyst 2 and a business anal
 
03:36:47.670 --> 03:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
three or those the same thing I'm sorry
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's probably a typo it is a business
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
systems analyst two two okay so that's
 
03:36:56.269 --> 03:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
so it's the second one in the box that
 
03:36:58.790 --> 03:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
you want you think can be correct and
 
03:37:01.070 --> 03:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
that is actually like I said in Do's
 
03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
budget but it comes through to us in our
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.870 --> 03:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
you page eight just to be thorough we
 
03:37:11.790 --> 03:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
included workers comp and unemployment
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
compensation not much to note there
 
03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
on page nine of the presentation and
 
03:37:17.760 --> 03:37:18.630 align:start position:0%
on page nine of the presentation and
Page

03:37:18.630 --> 03:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
Page
 
03:37:22.189 --> 03:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
129 of the governor's budget is the
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
division of taxpayers services where was
 
03:37:31.150 --> 03:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:33.790 --> 03:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
128 oh there it is
 
03:37:41.070 --> 03:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so was just 25 just wrong or is
 
03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
it um 25 we may not is there sufficient
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
money in that line we do have a we are
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
paying workers comp at this time and
 
03:37:52.590 --> 03:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
that's probably insufficient to cover
 
03:37:54.950 --> 03:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
what we will need for the
 
03:37:57.429 --> 03:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
year which is why it went up for 26 and
 
03:37:59.870 --> 03:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
27 yeah because we've seen certain
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
agencies their workers comp as as
 
03:38:05.070 --> 03:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
ballooned but yours it seems about the
 
03:38:08.670 --> 03:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
same fingers crossed it seems maybe tax
 
03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
is less dangerous then yeah I mean maybe
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's uh you don't lay off as
 
03:38:16.030 --> 03:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
many or something
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
anyway all right okay taxpayer Services
 
03:38:20.160 --> 03:38:26.710 align:start position:0%
anyway all right okay taxpayer Services
page

03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:29.670 --> 03:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
129 there are not really terribly
 
03:38:33.870 --> 03:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
significant changes here I would just
 
03:38:36.309 --> 03:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
note um class
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
103 which is the
 
03:38:41.590 --> 03:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
contracts for other services you'll see
 
03:38:44.429 --> 03:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
it was um actual in 24 was just under
 
03:38:48.070 --> 03:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
50,000 the budget for 25 is
 
03:38:51.790 --> 03:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
100,000 and then it drops to 85 and 65
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
essentially in 26 and 27 this is the
 
03:38:58.590 --> 03:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
line that we would utilize for temporary
 
03:39:00.870 --> 03:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
services that we may need during our
 
03:39:03.510 --> 03:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
busy Seasons to make sure that we get
 
03:39:05.670 --> 03:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
our documents processed in a timely
 
03:39:07.910 --> 03:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
manner our staffing levels were
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient in Fairly sufficient in 24 we
 
03:39:14.429 --> 03:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
didn't need wouldn't have needed much um
 
03:39:16.910 --> 03:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
so we did reduce in 26 and 27 but with
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
the UNF funding of all of our vacant
 
03:39:23.110 --> 03:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
positions in taxpayer Services there may
 
03:39:25.469 --> 03:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
be a need for those sorts of
 
03:39:27.790 --> 03:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
services so this is the part that
 
03:39:30.269 --> 03:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
answers the phones right is it um so
 
03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
some of these folks will answer the
 
03:39:35.229 --> 03:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
phones um they also will do all of our
 
03:39:36.830 --> 03:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
processing so they process all of the
 
03:39:39.429 --> 03:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
mail all of the payments they perform
 
03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
all of the account
 
03:39:44.110 --> 03:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance um necessary so these are
 
03:39:45.950 --> 03:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
the folks that kind of
 
03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
run the ship most of the most of the day
 
03:39:51.550 --> 03:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
so there's a fair number of un un vacant
 
03:39:53.389 --> 03:39:53.399 align:start position:0%
positions in this area correct on the
 
03:39:56.229 --> 03:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
last bullet on page nine the governor's
 
03:39:59.269 --> 03:39:59.279 align:start position:0%
budget UNF funds eight tax examiner twos
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
and one tax examiner three so we have
 
03:40:04.189 --> 03:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
nine positions that are unfunded in the
 
03:40:06.590 --> 03:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
governor's budget that is all of the
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
currently vacant positions and that's
 
03:40:11.950 --> 03:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
mostly due to indd going away that you
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
can manage I'm hoping we can manage um
 
03:40:17.349 --> 03:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
that's why I did kind of want to
 
03:40:19.990 --> 03:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
highlight that that class 103 where we
 
03:40:22.269 --> 03:40:22.279 align:start position:0%
may need temporary services I'm hopeful
 
03:40:25.389 --> 03:40:25.399 align:start position:0%
that we don't we will know better um in
 
03:40:27.790 --> 03:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
May because we will need we will be
 
03:40:29.229 --> 03:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
receiving interest and dividends tax
 
03:40:30.349 --> 03:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
returns this
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
April and so um we will be doing that
 
03:40:35.590 --> 03:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
with a reduced staff but to your point
 
03:40:37.950 --> 03:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
I'm confident more confident going
 
03:40:40.950 --> 03:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
forward with the elimination of that tax
 
03:40:42.790 --> 03:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we don't need as many positions as
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
we've had in the past how many returns
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
did it generate um interest in dividends
 
03:40:51.309 --> 03:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
tax would be somewhere between 70 and
 
03:40:54.189 --> 03:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
85,000 returns more in the last year
 
03:40:55.670 --> 03:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
because interest rates were higher we
 
03:40:58.510 --> 03:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
had a lot of firsttime filers um but if
 
03:40:59.870 --> 03:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
you look back a few years ago it was
 
03:41:03.150 --> 03:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
probably closer to 70,000 and and the
 
03:41:05.189 --> 03:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
bulk of those would be online all
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
automatic is that right or not this is
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
actually our um cohort that really
 
03:41:13.750 --> 03:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
prefers the paper forms we get the
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
largest number of paper form forms um
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
from this group a lot of people um will
 
03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
prepare them themselves um it's more of
 
03:41:24.910 --> 03:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
our business tax filers that utilize the
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
the online filing and how many of those
 
03:41:29.590 --> 03:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
are there that's probably closer to 75
 
03:41:30.630 --> 03:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
to 880,000
 
03:41:33.990 --> 03:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
filers so it's almost the same number in
 
03:41:35.790 --> 03:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
some years and some of them are are
 
03:41:38.469 --> 03:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms also and some aren't is
 
03:41:40.510 --> 03:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
that correct so some business tax filers
 
03:41:42.429 --> 03:41:42.439 align:start position:0%
will also have a monthly meals and rooms
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
obligation those are primarily filed
 
03:41:47.590 --> 03:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
online um because there is a requirement
 
03:41:49.950 --> 03:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
in statute that if the amount that
 
03:41:51.510 --> 03:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
you're due to pay is over a certain
 
03:41:52.870 --> 03:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
amount and you want to retain your
 
03:41:54.590 --> 03:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
commission you have to file
 
03:41:54.600 --> 03:41:56.110 align:start position:0%
commission you have to file
electronically

03:41:56.110 --> 03:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
03:41:59.429 --> 03:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
and uh business taxes are quarterly
 
03:42:01.630 --> 03:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
quarterly estimates and then a return or
 
03:42:04.030 --> 03:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
extension in March or April and then if
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
you make an extension payment then
 
03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
you're um you have a seven-month
 
03:42:08.750 --> 03:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
extension to file your full return into
 
03:42:11.229 --> 03:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
the fall meals and rooms monthly monthly
 
03:42:14.149 --> 03:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yeah so that's why you
 
03:42:17.990 --> 03:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
need you need more people in this
 
03:42:21.710 --> 03:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
department for those per return right
 
03:42:23.229 --> 03:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
because you're getting more volume
 
03:42:26.670 --> 03:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
correct yeah okay yep thank
 
03:42:29.110 --> 03:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
you um so I believe those are the
 
03:42:30.990 --> 03:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
highlights of taxpayer Services unless
 
03:42:32.710 --> 03:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
there's anything else that you want to
 
03:42:35.950 --> 03:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
cover any questions I'm not seeing hands
 
03:42:38.469 --> 03:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
so we'll keep going um audit division
 
03:42:41.550 --> 03:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
starts at the bottom of page
 
03:42:41.560 --> 03:42:43.269 align:start position:0%
starts at the bottom of page
130

03:42:43.269 --> 03:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
130
 
03:42:46.149 --> 03:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
um there's the most significant thing to
 
03:42:49.030 --> 03:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
talk about here outside of positions is
 
03:42:51.910 --> 03:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
the instate and outof state travel lines
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
mostly the out ofate travel line you
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
will see we spent just under 100,000 or
 
03:42:59.870 --> 03:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
just under 990,000 excuse me in fiscal
 
03:43:02.469 --> 03:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
year 24 but our adjusted authorized for
 
03:43:04.110 --> 03:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
25 is
 
03:43:06.790 --> 03:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
300,000 um that was because we have a
 
03:43:09.149 --> 03:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
number of vacant positions we were
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
hoping that we were going to fill some
 
03:43:12.990 --> 03:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
of those positions and when we do fill
 
03:43:15.910 --> 03:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
those positions Auditors travel in pairs
 
03:43:18.349 --> 03:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
as that new employee is trained and
 
03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
brought up to speed so without new
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
employees we didn't need to spend as
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
much that's been reduced from the 312
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
down to 100,000 in 26 and
 
03:43:32.189 --> 03:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
27 is the lack of these Auditors costing
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:39.550 --> 03:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue potentially I mean each auditor
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
does bring in money um I'm confident
 
03:43:46.269 --> 03:43:46.279 align:start position:0%
though that in the Auditors that we do
 
03:43:47.910 --> 03:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
have and in the management of that
 
03:43:50.149 --> 03:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
division that they're managing to make
 
03:43:52.229 --> 03:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
sure that we have as much compliance as
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
possible um this this um the house and
 
03:43:58.910 --> 03:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
both the Senate in Prior years have
 
03:44:03.030 --> 03:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
added positions um and just we have not
 
03:44:04.870 --> 03:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
been able to recruit for them
 
03:44:07.149 --> 03:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
successfully oh so the ones I think we
 
03:44:09.910 --> 03:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
added three of the Multistate Auditors
 
03:44:12.269 --> 03:44:12.279 align:start position:0%
yes our highest level Auditors and and
 
03:44:16.590 --> 03:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
so those were never filled I see well
 
03:44:18.030 --> 03:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
that might change with the layoffs at
 
03:44:21.149 --> 03:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
the IRS last week maybe there's some
 
03:44:25.550 --> 03:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
federal employees that I could uh that I
 
03:44:28.349 --> 03:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
could hire at this point so if if such a
 
03:44:30.830 --> 03:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
person became available then you could
 
03:44:33.269 --> 03:44:33.279 align:start position:0%
ask the governor to unfreeze that
 
03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
position potentially and so right now
 
03:44:38.510 --> 03:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget does
 
03:44:42.070 --> 03:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
unfund um nine positions which are two
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
tax field auditor ones those are um are
 
03:44:46.750 --> 03:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
more of our inate Auditors two multi-
 
03:44:48.790 --> 03:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
entity tax Auditors those are more of
 
03:44:51.030 --> 03:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
your like New England Regional business
 
03:44:53.349 --> 03:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
type Auditors and five of those
 
03:44:56.389 --> 03:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
multi-state tax Auditors there are four
 
03:44:58.309 --> 03:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
additional vacant positions that remain
 
03:45:02.189 --> 03:45:02.199 align:start position:0%
funded two tax field auditor ones a tax
 
03:45:04.149 --> 03:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
auditor one that just became vacant last
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
week and I did include that um and then
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
there is one multi-state tax auditor
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
that is still filled so if to your point
 
03:45:16.269 --> 03:45:16.279 align:start position:0%
if that position
 
03:45:19.149 --> 03:45:19.159 align:start position:0%
remained funded then yes I could proceed
 
03:45:22.510 --> 03:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
to ask the governor um for a waiver and
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
fund that position so I thought we
 
03:45:27.229 --> 03:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
decided that these unfunded ones were in
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer
 
03:45:31.469 --> 03:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
services not the Auditors we have them
 
03:45:34.630 --> 03:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
across the board oh okay I see they're
 
03:45:37.070 --> 03:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
in every division except collections
 
03:45:39.990 --> 03:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
because it's fully staffed got yeah no
 
03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
we have unfunded Auditors currently in
 
03:45:43.950 --> 03:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget so let's go go
 
03:45:45.590 --> 03:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
back um
 
03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
the total number un funded
 
03:45:52.710 --> 03:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
something I think it's 24 in the
 
03:45:55.560 --> 03:45:56.670 align:start position:0%
something I think it's 24 in the
governor's

03:45:56.670 --> 03:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
budget I see 24 yes in total I got so so
 
03:46:02.830 --> 03:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
they're scattered all around yeah I
 
03:46:04.389 --> 03:46:04.399 align:start position:0%
understand thank you 18 in our
 
03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
efficiency and then the governor added
 
03:46:09.990 --> 03:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:17.550 --> 03:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
okay um this is mentioned at the end um
 
03:46:19.550 --> 03:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
but I will note the and we talked about
 
03:46:21.149 --> 03:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
this when I was here previously there's
 
03:46:22.830 --> 03:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
a provision that you're probably aware
 
03:46:25.590 --> 03:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
of in the governor's um trailer bill
 
03:46:29.950 --> 03:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
that would allow um us to potentially
 
03:46:33.070 --> 03:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
fill unfunded positions so long as we
 
03:46:36.870 --> 03:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
stayed within our budgeted amount and so
 
03:46:39.630 --> 03:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair to your point we would look to
 
03:46:41.950 --> 03:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
these multi-state tax Auditors because
 
03:46:43.550 --> 03:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
these are the ones that do bring in the
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
most money um so those would be a
 
03:46:49.269 --> 03:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
priority to fill if we were able to even
 
03:46:50.790 --> 03:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
if they're unfunded if I can make the
 
03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
math work that would be an area that I'd
 
03:46:56.189 --> 03:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
be looking to so basically these these
 
03:46:58.110 --> 03:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
out ofst State companies they're just
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
getting audited instead of every two
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
years it's every three years or might be
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit longer correct correct I
 
03:47:06.189 --> 03:47:06.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously too that we pay
 
03:47:08.110 --> 03:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
some organizational dues to some
 
03:47:10.590 --> 03:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
national organizations and part of those
 
03:47:13.590 --> 03:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
is for some Cooperative auditing um and
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
so that is a way to
 
03:47:17.469 --> 03:47:17.479 align:start position:0%
that um one of those organizations is
 
03:47:19.630 --> 03:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
called The multi-state Tax Commission
 
03:47:21.950 --> 03:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
and they will go and audit very large
 
03:47:24.349 --> 03:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
companies for a number of states at the
 
03:47:26.110 --> 03:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
same time so we don't need to send our
 
03:47:28.510 --> 03:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
own Auditors they kind of audit on our
 
03:47:30.590 --> 03:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
behalf send us the results and we wrap
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
it up with the taxpayer so there are
 
03:47:34.030 --> 03:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
ways that we're still ensuring
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
compliance even if we don't have all of
 
03:47:38.950 --> 03:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
these positions filled do we when we do
 
03:47:40.670 --> 03:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
an audit do we share it with those
 
03:47:42.750 --> 03:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
people and we get some kind of credit I
 
03:47:45.269 --> 03:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
wish I wish we will do some Regional
 
03:47:47.710 --> 03:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
sharing um we have agreements with
 
03:47:50.110 --> 03:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Maine New Hampshire
 
03:47:52.429 --> 03:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
Vermont Connecticut so that we can kind
 
03:47:55.149 --> 03:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
of share if we're seeing things on audit
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
and it might be something that another
 
03:47:57.870 --> 03:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
state would be interested in and they'll
 
03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
share that same information with us all
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
right great um one bit of I think
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
housekeeping hopefully on page
 
03:48:10.469 --> 03:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
11 there is an error in the governor's
 
03:48:13.830 --> 03:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
budget where a position is listed as
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
vacant and it's currently
 
03:48:20.070 --> 03:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
filled and the position that's vacant is
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
listed as filled so we have them the
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
wrong way around we've spoken with the
 
03:48:26.110 --> 03:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
LBA about this I believe what we just
 
03:48:30.149 --> 03:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
need is um this committee to approve
 
03:48:32.950 --> 03:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
making this edit and then it will get
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
corrected going forward so Jack will
 
03:48:38.630 --> 03:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
make an amendment for us yeah perfect
 
03:48:38.640 --> 03:48:41.389 align:start position:0%
make an amendment for us yeah perfect
thank

03:48:41.389 --> 03:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:44.910 --> 03:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
you on page 12 this is the collection
 
03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
Division and this is on page
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
131 starts on page 131 of the governor's
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
budget um relatively small division this
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
is where you will see there is an
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
increase in the
 
03:49:03.070 --> 03:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
headcount from 24 and 25 to 26 and 27 we
 
03:49:05.469 --> 03:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
did move a position from another from
 
03:49:08.269 --> 03:49:08.279 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer services division in
 
03:49:12.189 --> 03:49:12.199 align:start position:0%
here um there's not a whole lot to talk
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
about in this division but we did
 
03:49:13.920 --> 03:49:15.229 align:start position:0%
about in this division but we did
identify

03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
identify
 
03:49:17.309 --> 03:49:17.319 align:start position:0%
a couple of areas where we felt like we
 
03:49:19.790 --> 03:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
could make a small reduction the first
 
03:49:23.630 --> 03:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
is to the current expense line uh class
 
03:49:27.229 --> 03:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
20 we would be comfortable with a $3,000
 
03:49:30.149 --> 03:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
reduction in 26 and a $2,000 reduction
 
03:49:32.670 --> 03:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
in 27 again it's small but I wanted to
 
03:49:35.510 --> 03:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that um make them both
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
six, that would bring them both down to
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
six I believe that's correct okay so
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
Jack make a
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
not um what is the land Acquisitions
 
03:49:51.070 --> 03:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
okay so that is where we pay for our
 
03:49:55.990 --> 03:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
filing fees for our leans so when we are
 
03:49:57.750 --> 03:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
kind of at the tail end of collection
 
03:50:01.750 --> 03:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
activities we will lean um property It's
 
03:50:04.030 --> 03:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
very effective it tends to get taxpayers
 
03:50:06.990 --> 03:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
attention quite quickly in all honesty
 
03:50:08.110 --> 03:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
and I think we've talked about this
 
03:50:10.349 --> 03:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
previously we are um typically very
 
03:50:12.149 --> 03:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
willing to release those leans um and
 
03:50:14.189 --> 03:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
work with the taxpayer um to make sure
 
03:50:15.990 --> 03:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
that they can enter into a payment plan
 
03:50:18.630 --> 03:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
and resolve um their debt without
 
03:50:21.870 --> 03:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
actually um garnishing their property um
 
03:50:24.510 --> 03:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
so this is another place where we could
 
03:50:29.110 --> 03:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
reduce um 10,000 a reduction of 10,000
 
03:50:31.910 --> 03:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
in each year um so it would go from
 
03:50:34.189 --> 03:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
48,000 in each year to
 
03:50:34.199 --> 03:50:36.990 align:start position:0%
48,000 in each year to
38,000

03:50:36.990 --> 03:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
38,000
 
03:50:39.550 --> 03:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
okay this division has no vacant
 
03:50:41.990 --> 03:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
positions currently um it was fully
 
03:50:45.229 --> 03:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
staffed um all along so there's no
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
um reductions in positions to this this
 
03:50:52.229 --> 03:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:54.590 --> 03:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank next on page 13 of the
 
03:50:57.510 --> 03:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
presentation and Page 133 of the
 
03:50:59.469 --> 03:50:59.479 align:start position:0%
governor's budget is the municipal and
 
03:50:59.479 --> 03:51:01.189 align:start position:0%
governor's budget is the municipal and
property

03:51:01.189 --> 03:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:51:06.189 --> 03:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
Division I wanted to talk about class
 
03:51:09.309 --> 03:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
38 you will see the fiscal year
 
03:51:14.630 --> 03:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
24 actual is 252,000 that goes up to 38
 
03:51:19.189 --> 03:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
4 and 25 then to 350 and 300 and 26 and
 
03:51:23.389 --> 03:51:23.399 align:start position:0%
27 I just wanted to note that that
 
03:51:26.870 --> 03:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
252 um really would be
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
325 roughly there was $775,000
 
03:51:35.550 --> 03:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
in bills from the vendor um which we
 
03:51:38.950 --> 03:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
paid in fiscal year 25 that was for work
 
03:51:42.670 --> 03:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
that was done in 24 that was due to
 
03:51:46.269 --> 03:51:46.279 align:start position:0%
issues in Billing on the vendor part and
 
03:51:48.030 --> 03:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
in all honesty I withheld payment until
 
03:51:50.030 --> 03:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
I was confident that the bills were
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
correct so that's why there was the
 
03:51:54.269 --> 03:51:54.279 align:start position:0%
delay so it's more flat than so it's
 
03:51:56.309 --> 03:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
essentially more flat and that 350 and
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
300 reflects um the contract amendment
 
03:52:01.469 --> 03:52:01.479 align:start position:0%
that we're currently in but it looked
 
03:52:03.070 --> 03:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
like we were increasing and we're really
 
03:52:04.429 --> 03:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
not I
 
03:52:08.670 --> 03:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
understood um CL control sure sorry
 
03:52:12.229 --> 03:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
flood control flood control
 
03:52:14.070 --> 03:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay how much do you want to talk about
 
03:52:17.070 --> 03:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
flood control um so this has been a
 
03:52:19.630 --> 03:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
topic as you'll remember over the
 
03:52:22.670 --> 03:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
years 26 and 27 assumes that
 
03:52:25.070 --> 03:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts will reimburse their share
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
of the 70% of the marac and 50% of the
 
03:52:29.830 --> 03:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Connecticut will
 
03:52:31.710 --> 03:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
reimburse their 40% share of the
 
03:52:34.349 --> 03:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
Connecticut compact as you know there's
 
03:52:37.389 --> 03:52:37.399 align:start position:0%
been a history of lack of payment so we
 
03:52:40.510 --> 03:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
received just under 3.5 million as a
 
03:52:44.030 --> 03:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
settlement for fiscal years 15 to 21 we
 
03:52:46.189 --> 03:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
received just under a million dollar for
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and 23 we are owed just
 
03:52:53.590 --> 03:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
under a million dollars for 24 and 25
 
03:52:55.550 --> 03:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
but have not received payment
 
03:52:59.229 --> 03:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
yet however I understand that these
 
03:53:01.550 --> 03:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
commissions are actively talking there
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
is work being done it's not um kind of
 
03:53:06.670 --> 03:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
the radio silence that we saw in the
 
03:53:09.389 --> 03:53:09.399 align:start position:0%
past but there are outstanding amounts
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
um that are
 
03:53:13.510 --> 03:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
due do we ever take them to court or
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's how we've gotten those
 
03:53:17.429 --> 03:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
settlements y I see yep but maybe it
 
03:53:20.469 --> 03:53:20.479 align:start position:0%
costs that much to go to court right
 
03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
right or do we have people on staff the
 
03:53:25.110 --> 03:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office usually helps
 
03:53:28.110 --> 03:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
us negotiate that um in the past so that
 
03:53:30.110 --> 03:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
and the um the attorney at the Attorney
 
03:53:31.990 --> 03:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
General's office who handled that has
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
been monitoring the progress yeah so so
 
03:53:36.630 --> 03:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
the so it's completely unknown I guess
 
03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right um land taxes lost okay
 
03:53:48.469 --> 03:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
so this is not one that we talk about
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
often but I will just mention it briefly
 
03:53:51.870 --> 03:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
because I think this is an area where we
 
03:53:55.389 --> 03:53:55.399 align:start position:0%
could have um just a small reduction so
 
03:53:58.870 --> 03:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is essentially reimbursing um towns
 
03:54:02.590 --> 03:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
for money that off for state and federal
 
03:54:05.229 --> 03:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
forests where they don't receive um tax
 
03:54:07.429 --> 03:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
revenue because it is owned by either
 
03:54:10.750 --> 03:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
the state or the federal government um
 
03:54:13.110 --> 03:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
these amounts do fluctuate year toe so
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
you'll see the 24 spense was just about
 
03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
$770,000 but our adjusted authorized in
 
03:54:21.910 --> 03:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
25 is 98,000 and then it goes to 95 for
 
03:54:23.309 --> 03:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
26 and
 
03:54:27.110 --> 03:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
27 um it's been as high as 990,000 in
 
03:54:30.550 --> 03:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
the past 5 years with the increases that
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
many municipalities are seeing in their
 
03:54:37.189 --> 03:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
tax rates I suspect that that 70,000 is
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
going to be more in the coming years but
 
03:54:42.910 --> 03:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
we could drop that 95,000 down to 90 in
 
03:54:44.630 --> 03:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
each year if if the committee wanted
 
03:54:46.590 --> 03:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
there's $5,000 in each year there that
 
03:54:49.149 --> 03:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
we could reduce do you know what the RSA
 
03:54:53.389 --> 03:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
is for this o not off the top of my head
 
03:54:56.750 --> 03:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
but we can maybe Jack can find out
 
03:55:00.550 --> 03:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
yeah because do we do this for other
 
03:55:03.590 --> 03:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
things like the State House complex for
 
03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
example it's just I think state and
 
03:55:09.990 --> 03:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
federal Forest is has always been my
 
03:55:12.910 --> 03:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of it um and I don't know
 
03:55:16.110 --> 03:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
if that was part of
 
03:55:17.950 --> 03:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
the negotiation when the White Mountain
 
03:55:20.670 --> 03:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
National Forest for instance um you know
 
03:55:21.710 --> 03:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
came to
 
03:55:25.750 --> 03:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
be I'm not sure typically
 
03:55:28.149 --> 03:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
for like a municipality like for the
 
03:55:31.030 --> 03:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
State House complex or you know any
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
college or university or other nonprofit
 
03:55:34.469 --> 03:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
they'll enter into a payment and Le of
 
03:55:36.870 --> 03:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
taxes with the town at the municipal
 
03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
level but I guess since this is you know
 
03:55:43.349 --> 03:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
larger amounts of state and federal land
 
03:55:45.910 --> 03:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
um it comes from the state to to help
 
03:55:53.950 --> 03:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:57.469 --> 03:55:57.479 align:start position:0%
okay um page 135 and 136 we have the
 
03:55:59.309 --> 03:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
current use board and the assessing
 
03:56:00.750 --> 03:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board these are
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
boards administratively attached to us
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
and all that you're seeing there is some
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
per DM rates and travel reimbursement
 
03:56:09.510 --> 03:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
the amounts are pretty
 
03:56:12.870 --> 03:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
flat on page
 
03:56:15.950 --> 03:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
137 you have the low and
 
03:56:20.110 --> 03:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
moderate um income tax relief program
 
03:56:21.990 --> 03:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
this is funded out of the education
 
03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:23.070 align:start position:0%
this is funded out of the education
trust

03:56:23.070 --> 03:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
trust
 
03:56:26.910 --> 03:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
fund um we're just just over 1.1 million
 
03:56:30.510 --> 03:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
in 24 and then we're flat from 25 to 27
 
03:56:35.189 --> 03:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
at 1 and A5 million um the amounts of um
 
03:56:37.710 --> 03:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
that property owners can
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
receive and the income limitations were
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
adjusted in
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
2021 um and so we saw some increase
 
03:56:47.670 --> 03:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
amount of payments there let's find out
 
03:56:51.750 --> 03:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
the RSA for this one also Jack um that I
 
03:56:51.760 --> 03:56:53.229 align:start position:0%
the RSA for this one also Jack um that I
probably

03:56:53.229 --> 03:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
have oh you do um no that was chapter
 
03:56:57.120 --> 03:57:08.950 align:start position:0%
have oh you do um no that was chapter
law

03:57:08.950 --> 03:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:11.269 --> 03:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
98 there's so many of these kind of
 
03:57:16.110 --> 03:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
things you know there's optional ones
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
given all kinds of this was for swept
 
03:57:22.550 --> 03:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
for swept I see right it is it
 
03:57:24.510 --> 03:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
reimburses them for the amount of swept
 
03:57:26.469 --> 03:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
that they
 
03:57:30.149 --> 03:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
paid yeah that they don't
 
03:57:33.990 --> 03:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
pay nobody pays Sweat Right um I don't
 
03:57:36.149 --> 03:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
have that off the top of my head but um
 
03:57:40.870 --> 03:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
can't right right stays local 100%
 
03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
right it's 100% fake okay we'll talk
 
03:57:51.750 --> 03:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
about that some other time all right um
 
03:57:53.830 --> 03:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
and then just on on the I think that's
 
03:57:56.349 --> 03:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
should be the end of our budget and just
 
03:57:58.110 --> 03:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
on the last page of the presentation
 
03:58:00.910 --> 03:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
page 17 I did highlight two sections
 
03:58:03.269 --> 03:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
from the governor's trailer Bill the one
 
03:58:05.309 --> 03:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned was the ability to fill
 
03:58:06.830 --> 03:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions if the total
 
03:58:08.349 --> 03:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
expenditures do not exceed the
 
03:58:10.990 --> 03:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation for personnel and benefits
 
03:58:12.510 --> 03:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
that was something I had talked about
 
03:58:14.670 --> 03:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
this committee with when I was here
 
03:58:20.510 --> 03:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
previously um and I think given that the
 
03:58:23.110 --> 03:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
at least with the governor's budget
 
03:58:26.990 --> 03:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:33.349 --> 03:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
count was going to go down to
 
03:58:37.070 --> 03:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
129 our headcount has hovered around
 
03:58:39.550 --> 03:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
150 since
 
03:58:42.149 --> 03:58:42.159 align:start position:0%
2012 we have not grown
 
03:58:44.950 --> 03:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
significantly um so
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm confident that we can do it we
 
03:58:50.550 --> 03:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot of dedicated employees but
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
certainly flexibility to make sure that
 
03:58:56.110 --> 03:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
you know we could fill positions if we
 
03:58:59.030 --> 03:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
had the money um would be appreciated
 
03:59:02.110 --> 03:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
you have a brand new computer yes true
 
03:59:03.750 --> 03:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
no that and it is true and we've
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
certainly gained efficiencies from that
 
03:59:09.950 --> 03:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
system as well um and I think the the
 
03:59:11.790 --> 03:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
current headcount will test that we can
 
03:59:14.269 --> 03:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
make it all happen um and then just on
 
03:59:15.510 --> 03:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
the other section there's a change to
 
03:59:16.870 --> 03:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
the distribution of funds in the
 
03:59:20.189 --> 03:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
governor's budget essentially the split
 
03:59:21.710 --> 03:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
of funds between the general fund and
 
03:59:23.790 --> 03:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund for the two
 
03:59:26.149 --> 03:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
business taxes the tobacco's tax and the
 
03:59:27.990 --> 03:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax and that's no
 
03:59:30.429 --> 03:59:30.439 align:start position:0%
problem for us to administer because of
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
our it that's certainly going to be
 
03:59:35.030 --> 03:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
moving around so no question about that
 
03:59:37.030 --> 03:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
it is our computer system allows us to
 
03:59:39.229 --> 03:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
make that change relatively easily so no
 
03:59:41.710 --> 03:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
concerns if that amount um continues to
 
03:59:43.830 --> 03:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
move what about the excess swept there's
 
03:59:48.670 --> 03:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
a Bill to um actually collect that right
 
03:59:52.149 --> 03:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
right there that um I believe there's a
 
03:59:54.309 --> 03:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached to that um
 
03:59:56.149 --> 03:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
requesting some funding if if that
 
03:59:58.630 --> 03:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
excess swept were to be collected by the
 
04:00:02.550 --> 04:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
department and then distributed back out
 
04:00:05.510 --> 04:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't think the I think
 
04:00:06.590 --> 04:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
the amount might have been around
 
04:00:08.710 --> 04:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
$100,000 but don't quote me because I
 
04:00:11.349 --> 04:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me um but it
 
04:00:13.510 --> 04:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
our system would be able to do that with
 
04:00:16.030 --> 04:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
the program pramming um it would the
 
04:00:18.269 --> 04:00:18.279 align:start position:0%
towns would log in and they would log in
 
04:00:19.990 --> 04:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
just like any other taxpayer and it
 
04:00:22.469 --> 04:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
would put them through a process um to
 
04:00:25.269 --> 04:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
do that um fairly easily I think once
 
04:00:26.750 --> 04:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's developed it would be easy to
 
04:00:28.110 --> 04:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
maintain oh so you could debit their
 
04:00:30.189 --> 04:00:30.199 align:start position:0%
bank account or that would be nice if
 
04:00:31.790 --> 04:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
they let us they can if they give us the
 
04:00:33.870 --> 04:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
information we'll take the money I see
 
04:00:36.070 --> 04:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay now there's there's kind of two
 
04:00:40.750 --> 04:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
ways to do that one bill I've seen says
 
04:00:42.750 --> 04:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
have them send in the excess for the for
 
04:00:44.469 --> 04:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
the handful of towns
 
04:00:47.229 --> 04:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
that have one other bills I've seen says
 
04:00:49.590 --> 04:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
every town send the whole thing and then
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
we will you know send our part and
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
there's some advantages to that as
 
04:00:59.030 --> 04:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
having to do with timing because the
 
04:01:01.349 --> 04:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
time they collect is not necessarily the
 
04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
time that we pay our corre adequate Ed
 
04:01:09.189 --> 04:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
right so correct um would that be a lot
 
04:01:12.110 --> 04:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
more work or or from your point of view
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
is one of those better than the other or
 
04:01:16.149 --> 04:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
so I misheard when you spoke previously
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
I think the $100,000 is to do it for
 
04:01:21.030 --> 04:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
everybody I see the excess swept I think
 
04:01:22.590 --> 04:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
we could probably AFF effectuate that
 
04:01:25.469 --> 04:01:25.479 align:start position:0%
because that's a handful of towns um I
 
04:01:27.309 --> 04:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
think it's could still be 30 or
 
04:01:29.349 --> 04:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
something 30 so the the price tag on
 
04:01:32.550 --> 04:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
that is probably a little bit less um
 
04:01:33.510 --> 04:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
thing where in a perfect world M every
 
04:01:40.990 --> 04:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
property owner would pay their bill in
 
04:01:42.950 --> 04:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
the time that they're supposed to pay it
 
04:01:45.990 --> 04:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
and so one payment could be made to the
 
04:01:49.469 --> 04:01:49.479 align:start position:0%
state unfortunately that's not reality
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so it would likely mean towns might
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
have to make multiple payments right
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
because they're not going to or they
 
04:01:59.309 --> 04:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
would have to front the money for the
 
04:02:03.030 --> 04:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
difference um so I think the system
 
04:02:04.469 --> 04:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
would need to be flexible that there
 
04:02:05.710 --> 04:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
might we might need to be able to
 
04:02:08.349 --> 04:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
receive multiple payments yeah but every
 
04:02:12.429 --> 04:02:12.439 align:start position:0%
town has very large you know
 
04:02:15.910 --> 04:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
balance um accounts right they can
 
04:02:17.790 --> 04:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
smooth this sort of thing out yeah
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative there's a lot of towns
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
that only collect twice a year some four
 
04:02:24.510 --> 04:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
times a year so that would might be fine
 
04:02:27.269 --> 04:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
complicate that as well right it right
 
04:02:28.870 --> 04:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
and if their tax
 
04:02:33.389 --> 04:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
rate is set in the fall before those
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
December bills that's fine but we every
 
04:02:39.269 --> 04:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
year there are towns who for a variety
 
04:02:41.950 --> 04:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
of reasons don't have a tax rate until
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
we set our last tax rate last week we so
 
04:02:45.279 --> 04:02:46.309 align:start position:0%
we set our last tax rate last week we so
that

04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
municipality has not been collecting any
 
04:02:53.790 --> 04:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
money from a cent or the money that they
 
04:02:56.110 --> 04:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
would have collected say in January the
 
04:02:58.309 --> 04:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
bills hadn't even gone out so we do have
 
04:03:00.830 --> 04:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
towns that run into a bit of a cash flow
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
problem and need to explore options like
 
04:03:05.910 --> 04:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
a tax anticipation note or other
 
04:03:07.790 --> 04:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
financing to make sure that they they
 
04:03:09.149 --> 04:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
can keep the lights on and the doors
 
04:03:12.030 --> 04:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
open um and pay their bills so is the
 
04:03:15.309 --> 04:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
swept rate like one a quar per or
 
04:03:18.110 --> 04:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
something I mean a dollar and a quarter
 
04:03:20.429 --> 04:03:20.439 align:start position:0%
per thousand something like that
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
something close to that I don't have the
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
I can picture the warrant but I can't
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
see the amount in my in my mind and when
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
was 363 million set I believe that was
 
04:03:35.710 --> 04:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
in the original um in the original bill
 
04:03:37.910 --> 04:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
it was D the original enabling
 
04:03:40.389 --> 04:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
legislation it was dropped to
 
04:03:44.510 --> 04:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
263 um two budgets ago for one year
 
04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
correct and now back we talking about 20
 
04:03:49.950 --> 04:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
years or more is yeah probably close to
 
04:03:54.830 --> 04:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:57.269 --> 04:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
you all right there might be a little
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
inflation since then all right
 
04:04:00.990 --> 04:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative evil and then
 
04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative Le thank you just back on
 
04:04:07.469 --> 04:04:07.479 align:start position:0%
the low and moderate income uh thing I I
 
04:04:11.910 --> 04:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
wonder because towns have the ability to
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
Abate property taxes based on lowincome
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
considerations I wonder if this is just
 
04:04:18.319 --> 04:04:19.590 align:start position:0%
considerations I wonder if this is just
a

04:04:19.590 --> 04:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
parallel authorization for the state
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
because swept is a state property tax
 
04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
and so you want to be able to give the
 
04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
lower income folks that
 
04:04:35.070 --> 04:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
option yes and no it's not a full
 
04:04:36.710 --> 04:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
abatement it'll be a
 
04:04:39.149 --> 04:04:39.159 align:start position:0%
reimbursement um so it may not cover the
 
04:04:43.389 --> 04:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
full amount um and they do need to pay
 
04:04:46.670 --> 04:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
it so if they can't pay it up front
 
04:04:48.510 --> 04:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be eligible for
 
04:04:50.630 --> 04:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
this where an abatement would allow them
 
04:04:52.349 --> 04:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
to just not make a payment so this is
 
04:04:54.510 --> 04:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
more like a reimbursement but it may not
 
04:04:56.030 --> 04:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
be for the full amount depending on the
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
property owner in the town kind of a
 
04:05:00.910 --> 04:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
parallel a similar idea it's a way to
 
04:05:04.349 --> 04:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
support those low and moderate incomes
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
um those with low and modate income had
 
04:05:07.110 --> 04:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
I've had
 
04:05:09.309 --> 04:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
constituents um to protect this
 
04:05:11.950 --> 04:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
situation and with property taxes
 
04:05:14.429 --> 04:05:14.439 align:start position:0%
escalating the way they are they really
 
04:05:18.269 --> 04:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
do depend on this and I think you guys
 
04:05:21.429 --> 04:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
have simplified the process in a way
 
04:05:23.710 --> 04:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
we've try they're really thankful for
 
04:05:26.790 --> 04:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
the funding good they we we try to make
 
04:05:28.590 --> 04:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
it as simple as possible they can use a
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
paper form they can use our online forms
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
they can come into the office and we can
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
help them with it we also will now this
 
04:05:36.429 --> 04:05:36.439 align:start position:0%
year have the ability um for them to
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
check the status of their
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
claim um and so we do we work with AARP
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
and other organizations like that that
 
04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that folks are aware of
 
04:05:46.910 --> 04:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
this and can get it filed if they need
 
04:05:49.070 --> 04:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
to do you know the count of the number
 
04:05:51.750 --> 04:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
of people and and what does it cost your
 
04:05:54.309 --> 04:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
agency is there full-time employees
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
involved this is handled by our taxpayer
 
04:05:59.309 --> 04:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
services division it's a pretty short
 
04:06:02.110 --> 04:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
season um they the claims cannot be
 
04:06:06.910 --> 04:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
filed before May 1st um and so right
 
04:06:09.149 --> 04:06:09.159 align:start position:0%
when we come off the tales of of April
 
04:06:11.710 --> 04:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
15th the same employees can move right
 
04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
into doing this there were five
 
04:06:18.429 --> 04:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
811 claims last year and that makes up
 
04:06:21.510 --> 04:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
that 1.1
 
04:06:24.349 --> 04:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
million and any given claim isn't that
 
04:06:26.349 --> 04:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
huge right they're they're they're
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
rather small and and the income levels
 
04:06:32.070 --> 04:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
are quite low right it as you mentioned
 
04:06:34.349 --> 04:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty simple form um we make
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
sure that it is filled out properly and
 
04:06:39.630 --> 04:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
the documents are attached um the filing
 
04:06:44.590 --> 04:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
period is May 1st to June 30 how however
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
um we can accept them as late as
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
November 1st so long as there's some
 
04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
reason why there was a delay in the in
 
04:06:54.429 --> 04:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
the filing and so we're pretty generous
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
with that um sometimes they haven't
 
04:06:57.910 --> 04:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
filed their income tax their federal
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
income tax return which needs to be
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
included um there might be other reasons
 
04:07:04.750 --> 04:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
but it's pretty short season and then it
 
04:07:07.110 --> 04:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
it will Trail into the fall a little bit
 
04:07:10.429 --> 04:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
so it's averaging like $240 each that's
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
roughly okay yep in my mind it's 250
 
04:07:13.520 --> 04:07:14.950 align:start position:0%
roughly okay yep in my mind it's 250
represent

04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:07:18.070 --> 04:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
LE thank you Mr chairman and as always
 
04:07:19.990 --> 04:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner we've got a very good uh
 
04:07:22.269 --> 04:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
breakdown and we're lucky to have you I
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
do have a one question dealing with the
 
04:07:28.149 --> 04:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
numbers U as far as the number of people
 
04:07:30.109 --> 04:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
that you're unfund you're not
 
04:07:32.389 --> 04:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
eliminating any of those positions just
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
unfunded nope they're just unfunded um
 
04:07:37.469 --> 04:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
they're not abolished and again that
 
04:07:40.630 --> 04:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
provision in the governor's trailer bill
 
04:07:42.870 --> 04:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
um would allow us to potentially fill
 
04:07:44.790 --> 04:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
some of those unfunded positions if we
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
can make it work um in terms of the
 
04:07:49.550 --> 04:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
numbers so if there's the availability
 
04:07:51.309 --> 04:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
in the budget and we can make the
 
04:07:54.109 --> 04:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
numbers work we will um obviously over
 
04:07:56.590 --> 04:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
the course of a bium we will have
 
04:07:58.990 --> 04:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
retirements we will have people that
 
04:08:02.429 --> 04:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
that leave and I fully intend to
 
04:08:04.510 --> 04:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
evaluate every one of those vacancies
 
04:08:06.429 --> 04:08:06.439 align:start position:0%
and determine do I need to fill that
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
exact position or should I look to one
 
04:08:10.149 --> 04:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
of the Auditors that would generate
 
04:08:13.550 --> 04:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
money or do we need support in another
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
area because as the chair mentioned
 
04:08:17.309 --> 04:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
we're in a a time of change with the
 
04:08:19.710 --> 04:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax going away and
 
04:08:21.309 --> 04:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
the revenue information management
 
04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
system with rims being fully operational
 
04:08:27.710 --> 04:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
we are on the current version um we're
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
kind of cruising we're it's it's it's
 
04:08:34.349 --> 04:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
paying off and so um that ability to
 
04:08:37.109 --> 04:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
reflect on each vacancy as it happens
 
04:08:39.469 --> 04:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
and make an educated decision about what
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
what we should do with that money um
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
that flexibility is tremendously helpful
 
04:08:47.109 --> 04:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
so followup Mr chairman thank you so now
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
I have a question where you get paid the
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
big bucks for uh Revenue projections now
 
04:08:54.149 --> 04:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
obviously you just mentioned interest in
 
04:08:57.469 --> 04:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
dividends which is like 184 million from
 
04:09:00.510 --> 04:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
the last full collection year business
 
04:09:03.590 --> 04:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
taxes are down about 110 million so far
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
tobacco's down about 20 million how
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
confident are you in the figures that
 
04:09:11.950 --> 04:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
we've been provided by the governor as
 
04:09:13.790 --> 04:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
far as these Revenue numbers because the
 
04:09:15.710 --> 04:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
trend especially business taxes is
 
04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
continually going down going down sure
 
04:09:19.710 --> 04:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
so the governor's Revenue estimates are
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the range of numbers that I'm
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable with um they are at the
 
04:09:26.710 --> 04:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
higher end of the range um but for
 
04:09:29.070 --> 04:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
business taxes for instance the numbers
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
I believe assume somewhere between a 5
 
04:09:36.030 --> 04:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
to 8% year-over-year growth um business
 
04:09:38.830 --> 04:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
taxes can fluctuate quite a bit and that
 
04:09:40.990 --> 04:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
is difficult being our largest revenue
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
Source um but when you take out a nom
 
04:09:46.349 --> 04:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
IES of significant increases or
 
04:09:46.359 --> 04:09:47.469 align:start position:0%
IES of significant increases or
significant

04:09:47.469 --> 04:09:47.479 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:09:51.269 --> 04:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
decreases 5 to 8% um year-over-year is
 
04:09:53.830 --> 04:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
is a common you know non-anomalous
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
change in business taxes the reason why
 
04:09:59.510 --> 04:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
I believe they're going down at the
 
04:10:03.510 --> 04:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
moment um is because we are coming off
 
04:10:04.510 --> 04:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
of a
 
04:10:07.070 --> 04:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
period of time for businesses where
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
there were tremendous growth in
 
04:10:10.590 --> 04:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
corporate profits there was a tremendous
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
amount of money in the economy from Co
 
04:10:12.960 --> 04:10:14.429 align:start position:0%
amount of money in the economy from Co
relief

04:10:14.429 --> 04:10:14.439 align:start position:0%
relief
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
um and like I said business profits were
 
04:10:18.750 --> 04:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
just growing many businesses especially
 
04:10:20.790 --> 04:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
if they're publicly traded don't ever
 
04:10:23.389 --> 04:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
want to be caught short with the amount
 
04:10:25.389 --> 04:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
of money that they've paid in taxes they
 
04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to report to their
 
04:10:29.950 --> 04:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
shareholders that they had an unknown
 
04:10:33.269 --> 04:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
large year-end tax bill so what we've
 
04:10:36.990 --> 04:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
seen I believe is a lot of businesses
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
paying to the states and the federal
 
04:10:41.630 --> 04:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
government a lot of money in estimated
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
payments because they didn't want to be
 
04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
caught short and estimates are our
 
04:10:48.429 --> 04:10:48.439 align:start position:0%
largest source of Revenue now as the
 
04:10:51.790 --> 04:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
economy is kind of stabilizing we're not
 
04:10:53.590 --> 04:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
in this period of tremendous growth
 
04:10:55.550 --> 04:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
we're not in a downturn but we're not in
 
04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
this period of tremendous growth
 
04:10:58.830 --> 04:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are taking a step back and
 
04:11:01.590 --> 04:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
saying okay I've overpaid my estimates
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
now two or three years in a row I'm
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
going to rightsize those estimated
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
payments so that's what I think we're
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
seeing we're still seeing the underlying
 
04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
liability of the businesses grow from
 
04:11:15.630 --> 04:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
year to year they're just rightsizing
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
their estimated payments and so that's
 
04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
why we're seeing the reduction in
 
04:11:21.750 --> 04:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue we saw this also with the tax
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
cut and jobs act back in
 
04:11:27.070 --> 04:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
2017 many businesses knew that they were
 
04:11:29.070 --> 04:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
going to face an increased tax bill at
 
04:11:31.109 --> 04:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
the federal level and they weren't sure
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
what was going to happen at the state
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
level so they paid us excess amounts in
 
04:11:39.469 --> 04:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
estimates and then right sized it the
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
next year so we're in a right sizing
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
mode if if that makes sense but I've
 
04:11:46.670 --> 04:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of the increase in your
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
refunds which seem to be accelerating so
 
04:11:52.670 --> 04:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
the increase in refunds um a large
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
portion of that is due to the credit
 
04:11:56.830 --> 04:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
carryover cap that the legislature and
 
04:11:59.429 --> 04:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
the governor put in place so businesses
 
04:12:02.229 --> 04:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
can no longer carry forward from one
 
04:12:05.469 --> 04:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
year to the next more than 500% of their
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
liability so if your liability in 24 is
 
04:12:12.030 --> 04:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
$100 you can't have a credit carryover
 
04:12:13.870 --> 04:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
in excess of 500
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
so we've been forced to
 
04:12:20.349 --> 04:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
refund money back to taxpayers which has
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
caused the increase in refunds so just
 
04:12:25.389 --> 04:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
one final comment I I miss
 
04:12:25.399 --> 04:12:26.750 align:start position:0%
one final comment I I miss
representative

04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
major because Mr uh representative The
 
04:12:32.349 --> 04:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
Honorable representative major uh was
 
04:12:35.950 --> 04:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
probably would come in at 2% versus 5 to
 
04:12:39.149 --> 04:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
8% the and I think of him often with the
 
04:12:41.550 --> 04:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
credit carryovers that was a significant
 
04:12:44.070 --> 04:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
concern of his um because the credit
 
04:12:46.590 --> 04:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
carryover amount seemed to be kind of
 
04:12:48.990 --> 04:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
ballooning year-over-year and he did
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
want he felt like that was a significant
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
liability to the state and that we
 
04:12:54.750 --> 04:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
needed to do something about it so you
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
haven't talked to him in consultation I
 
04:13:01.630 --> 04:13:01.640 align:start position:0%
have not all right representive gri um
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'm glad uh representative leechman
 
04:13:05.790 --> 04:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
asked the last question because that was
 
04:13:08.309 --> 04:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
my question but I'd like to know how
 
04:13:11.710 --> 04:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
much how many um millions of dollars
 
04:13:15.870 --> 04:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
approximately did we we return and re in
 
04:13:19.030 --> 04:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
overpayments and due to the legislation
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
that we passed I will get you that
 
04:13:24.990 --> 04:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
number I have it on a piece of paper I
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
believe I don't want to misspeak so I
 
04:13:29.070 --> 04:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
will get you that information I have it
 
04:13:31.590 --> 04:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
broken out because taxpayers do a number
 
04:13:34.429 --> 04:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
of things um some request a refund and
 
04:13:36.030 --> 04:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
they're not at the cap amount but
 
04:13:37.630 --> 04:13:37.640 align:start position:0%
they've just chosen to take the money
 
04:13:39.870 --> 04:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
back rather than leaving it on account
 
04:13:43.429 --> 04:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
some taxpayers request a refund only to
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
that 500% cap and some go beyond the 500
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
but not the full amount so I have a
 
04:13:51.070 --> 04:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
breakdown for you and I'm happy to
 
04:13:52.830 --> 04:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
provide that to Jack to share with the
 
04:13:55.109 --> 04:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
committee it seems bizarre to me that
 
04:13:56.550 --> 04:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
someone would want to leave that much
 
04:13:59.429 --> 04:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
money with the state I mean I'll be
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
honest with you when you it surprises me
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
too um when you look at some of these
 
04:14:09.670 --> 04:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
very large multinational corporations
 
04:14:11.550 --> 04:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
and you look at their apportionment to
 
04:14:14.990 --> 04:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so what por of their pie
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
is going to come to New
 
04:14:18.750 --> 04:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know sometimes it's less
 
04:14:21.790 --> 04:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
than 1% but it's millions of dollars for
 
04:14:25.510 --> 04:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
us and so I just think when they've got
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
the federal government large states like
 
04:14:30.429 --> 04:14:30.439 align:start position:0%
New York and California I think to some
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
extent maybe they're not always paying
 
04:14:34.030 --> 04:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
attention and they might not realize be
 
04:14:35.790 --> 04:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
out of sight out of mind out of mind I
 
04:14:35.800 --> 04:14:38.950 align:start position:0%
out of sight out of mind out of mind I
see

04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.830 --> 04:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay yeah representative you thank you
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
um so you you pretty much answered this
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
question about the decrease in what you
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
know the right sizing issue but you
 
04:14:54.109 --> 04:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
remember um we switched for business
 
04:14:57.870 --> 04:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
taxes purposes from taxing on personnel
 
04:15:01.870 --> 04:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
and property to single sales factor and
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
I wondered if it's within your ability
 
04:15:08.189 --> 04:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
to quantify the effect of that yep we
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
have that as well and I'm happy to send
 
04:15:12.109 --> 04:15:12.119 align:start position:0%
that that can fluctuate from time to
 
04:15:14.109 --> 04:15:14.119 align:start position:0%
time um but I can send you what the
 
04:15:16.349 --> 04:15:16.359 align:start position:0%
impact of single sales Factor versus the
 
04:15:18.990 --> 04:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
three- weighted double um sales Factor
 
04:15:21.389 --> 04:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
meant I have um we produced that report
 
04:15:22.510 --> 04:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of every month so I'm happy
 
04:15:24.790 --> 04:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
to share that can you uh give a little
 
04:15:27.630 --> 04:15:27.640 align:start position:0%
preview has it helped or it has helped
 
04:15:30.630 --> 04:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
or it has helped great it has helped um
 
04:15:33.149 --> 04:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
and that you know U theoretically makes
 
04:15:37.149 --> 04:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
sense given this time of economic
 
04:15:40.950 --> 04:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
growth um focusing solely the
 
04:15:43.109 --> 04:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
apportionment solely on sales when
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
economy is doing really well it it would
 
04:15:47.910 --> 04:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
make sense that it has been beneficial
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
so that kind of tracks with the theory
 
04:15:52.149 --> 04:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's very so unlike the other method
 
04:15:56.750 --> 04:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's pretty um economy related so if we
 
04:15:58.750 --> 04:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
were in a recession it could push it
 
04:16:01.910 --> 04:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
down right the I would say sales when
 
04:16:04.349 --> 04:16:04.359 align:start position:0%
you're talking about payroll property
 
04:16:08.070 --> 04:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
and sales sales is the most vital of
 
04:16:11.630 --> 04:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
those factors right that can your sales
 
04:16:14.510 --> 04:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
can change very quickly just based on
 
04:16:16.469 --> 04:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
the wind out in the economy right
 
04:16:18.070 --> 04:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
consumers you know if you're in retail
 
04:16:21.030 --> 04:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
consumers can get skittish very quickly
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
um payroll you're more businesses are
 
04:16:25.950 --> 04:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
more in charge of that presumably they
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
take any layoffs or significant
 
04:16:30.550 --> 04:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
decreases or changes to their payroll
 
04:16:32.309 --> 04:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
that is something that doesn't always
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
happen overnight it tends to be a longer
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
process and same with property buying or
 
04:16:37.469 --> 04:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
selling a property changing the amount
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
of property that a business owns is
 
04:16:41.469 --> 04:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
again something that is not going to
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
change Like the Wind so the payroll and
 
04:16:45.910 --> 04:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
property factors tend to be a bit more
 
04:16:48.750 --> 04:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
stable um but at least at this point
 
04:16:50.910 --> 04:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor has has been um
 
04:16:54.429 --> 04:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue positive for us thank you um the
 
04:16:57.389 --> 04:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
governor's budget includes uh money from
 
04:16:59.710 --> 04:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
slot machines is that a vect you at all
 
04:17:01.229 --> 04:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
or is that all lottery that's all
 
04:17:03.710 --> 04:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
lottery okay and I have a feeling I
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
asked this question two years ago but
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
I'll ask it again anyway Which tax is um
 
04:17:12.510 --> 04:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
the most expensive to collect in terms
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
of cost for for income you don't
 
04:17:18.309 --> 04:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
remember my answer I
 
04:17:20.550 --> 04:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
don't the interest and dividends the
 
04:17:22.030 --> 04:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax that's gone
 
04:17:24.670 --> 04:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
so what's the next one oh there aren't
 
04:17:27.950 --> 04:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
left the the reason for the interest in
 
04:17:32.670 --> 04:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
dividends tax is you you asked a great
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
question about the number of taxpayers
 
04:17:35.830 --> 04:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
and how the number of taxpayers is very
 
04:17:38.309 --> 04:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
similar to number of business taxpayers
 
04:17:39.950 --> 04:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
business taxes bring over you know
 
04:17:41.429 --> 04:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
billion dollars a year interest in
 
04:17:44.189 --> 04:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
dividends while meaning full at 184
 
04:17:47.349 --> 04:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
million is much less than that um with
 
04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax we receive a
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
lot of um returns for you know $100 $200
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned especially in the past
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
year where a lot of folks were caught
 
04:18:02.109 --> 04:18:02.119 align:start position:0%
not realizing that they they had a
 
04:18:04.389 --> 04:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
filing obligation but interest rates
 
04:18:05.870 --> 04:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
were high and they earned some interest
 
04:18:07.429 --> 04:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
income that that put them over the
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
threshold that they hadn't seen that
 
04:18:13.590 --> 04:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
level of interest inome in years so
 
04:18:16.010 --> 04:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
okay after interest in dividends
 
04:18:16.020 --> 04:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
okay after interest in dividends
[Music]

04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:18:23.149 --> 04:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
um it would it would be hard because um
 
04:18:25.630 --> 04:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
the tobacco tax while it impacts
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
everyone that consumes tobacco or
 
04:18:29.469 --> 04:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
nicotine products it's collected at the
 
04:18:32.830 --> 04:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
wholesale level um and so our universe
 
04:18:34.870 --> 04:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with there is smaller
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax is
 
04:18:38.590 --> 04:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
collected by the counties um the meals
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
and rentals tax is collected by The
 
04:18:42.229 --> 04:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
Operators that's probably in the next
 
04:18:42.239 --> 04:18:43.510 align:start position:0%
Operators that's probably in the next
largest

04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
largest
 
04:18:46.950 --> 04:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
volume in terms of returns excluding
 
04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
because it's monthly but again it's
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
largely automated through the system um
 
04:18:55.229 --> 04:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
probably Statewide would be uh toll
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
boost I would guess yeah but that's not
 
04:19:00.510 --> 04:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
involving you right right okay thank you
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%

04:19:06.550 --> 04:19:06.560 align:start position:0%

came spoke but that was just the
 
04:19:25.710 --> 04:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
preliminary right we haven't had the
 
04:19:28.030 --> 04:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
fold yeah that's right
 
04:19:33.149 --> 04:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I marked preliminary with a DOT I
 
04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
understand no he's talking with him all
 
04:19:35.840 --> 04:19:38.109 align:start position:0%
understand no he's talking with him all
right

04:19:38.109 --> 04:19:38.119 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:19:41.109 --> 04:19:41.119 align:start position:0%
so welcome secretary
 
04:19:45.269 --> 04:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:49.109 --> 04:19:49.119 align:start position:0%
be yeah all right so now we are going to
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
be on page uh 112 through 126 maybe
 
04:19:56.750 --> 04:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
we'll start on 126
 
04:19:56.760 --> 04:19:59.710 align:start position:0%
we'll start on 126
and3

04:19:59.710 --> 04:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
and3
 
04:20:02.269 --> 04:20:02.279 align:start position:0%
yeah3 yeah oh this is an error by the
 
04:20:05.710 --> 04:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
way Jack in the um in the index it says
 
04:20:08.330 --> 04:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
113 but it's actually
 
04:20:08.340 --> 04:20:10.269 align:start position:0%
113 but it's actually
[Laughter]

04:20:10.269 --> 04:20:10.279 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
112 So I I check it last night cuz I was
 
04:20:15.990 --> 04:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
I saying why are we starting in the
 
04:20:22.030 --> 04:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
middle anyways so this budget
 
04:20:25.630 --> 04:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah so so uh there's there's a four
 
04:20:27.349 --> 04:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
more employees and a significant
 
04:20:29.149 --> 04:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
increase in general funds and a
 
04:20:32.790 --> 04:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
significant decrease in other funds so
 
04:20:33.670 --> 04:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
it looks
 
04:20:33.680 --> 04:20:34.770 align:start position:0%
it looks
interesting

04:20:34.770 --> 04:20:34.780 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
04:20:34.780 --> 04:20:36.389 align:start position:0%
interesting
[Music]

04:20:36.389 --> 04:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:20:39.189 --> 04:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman members of
 
04:20:41.109 --> 04:20:41.119 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm David scanland
 
04:20:43.950 --> 04:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State um before I get
 
04:20:48.030 --> 04:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
started representative wer held up the
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh pocket
 
04:20:53.830 --> 04:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution that that uh you know this
 
04:20:56.790 --> 04:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
this committee had a lot to do with I
 
04:20:57.950 --> 04:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
actually have some one of my staff
 
04:21:00.670 --> 04:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
members coming across the street with uh
 
04:21:02.750 --> 04:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
copies for each of you but we waited
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
until after the Constitutional
 
04:21:07.790 --> 04:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
question uh was disposed of on the on
 
04:21:10.870 --> 04:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
the last ballot and then we were able to
 
04:21:13.229 --> 04:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
print them so we have a generous Supply
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
if you have any that you want to give to
 
04:21:16.750 --> 04:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
your constituents or if your
 
04:21:18.149 --> 04:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
constituents want to come and pick them
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
up they they are now available and I
 
04:21:23.590 --> 04:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
think they came out
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
great so uh the budget that is before
 
04:21:29.389 --> 04:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
you is the one that's proposed by the
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
governor uh we made the uh suggested
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
cuts that uh she proposed um and there
 
04:21:42.189 --> 04:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
are four positions that are requested in
 
04:21:44.830 --> 04:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
the bud three of those are
 
04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
replacing uh existing temporary
 
04:21:50.309 --> 04:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
positions that are currently filled uh
 
04:21:51.550 --> 04:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
at the present
 
04:21:56.109 --> 04:21:56.119 align:start position:0%
time uh so those positions will actually
 
04:21:59.149 --> 04:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
increase the general fund uh component
 
04:22:02.469 --> 04:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
there but under the temporary um I think
 
04:22:07.309 --> 04:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
they drop off and then uh I have a uh an
 
04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
assistant secretary position that is
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
currently filled with an individual that
 
04:22:15.550 --> 04:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
is working on uh voter Outreach and
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
Civics uh
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
education uh the proposal is to make
 
04:22:23.710 --> 04:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:26.269 --> 04:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
position and that is a summary of the
 
04:22:29.349 --> 04:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
four positions that are in the
 
04:22:31.389 --> 04:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
budget oh but it's currently an
 
04:22:34.670 --> 04:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
unclassified position yes so shouldn't
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
that go from 16 to
 
04:22:43.389 --> 04:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think we're eliminating the
 
04:22:47.109 --> 04:22:47.119 align:start position:0%
unclassified position so we're just
 
04:22:49.950 --> 04:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
we're creating oh for this particular
 
04:22:52.109 --> 04:22:52.119 align:start position:0%
project yes but you'll still have an
 
04:22:52.119 --> 04:22:53.590 align:start position:0%
project yes but you'll still have an
assistant

04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
04:22:57.990 --> 04:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
secretary yeah okay I get it um I think
 
04:23:01.469 --> 04:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
that you received a copy of the vacant
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
positions um that we currently Have I
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
None of those are funded however with
 
04:23:07.040 --> 04:23:07.950 align:start position:0%
None of those are funded however with
General

04:23:07.950 --> 04:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
General
 
04:23:07.960 --> 04:23:08.970 align:start position:0%
General
funds

04:23:08.970 --> 04:23:08.980 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:23:08.980 --> 04:23:10.510 align:start position:0%
funds
[Music]

04:23:10.510 --> 04:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that um you know
 
04:23:16.030 --> 04:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
maybe for the benefit of the newer
 
04:23:17.149 --> 04:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
members on the
 
04:23:19.750 --> 04:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh the Secretary of State's
 
04:23:23.149 --> 04:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
office raises a lot of Revenue
 
04:23:26.750 --> 04:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
um uh in our Securities division all of
 
04:23:29.229 --> 04:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
the fees that are paid by broker dealer
 
04:23:32.469 --> 04:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
registrations are uh go directly to the
 
04:23:35.229 --> 04:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
general fund and that amounts to about
 
04:23:35.239 --> 04:23:36.830 align:start position:0%
general fund and that amounts to about
$44

04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
$44
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
million Securities operates on the fine
 
04:23:42.510 --> 04:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
money that they collect uh they're able
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
to carry over I think it's
 
04:23:48.389 --> 04:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
750,000 from one by anym to the next
 
04:23:51.109 --> 04:23:51.119 align:start position:0%
just to meet payroll but then once the
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
fines are collected they continue and
 
04:23:55.710 --> 04:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
any additional funds there laps to the
 
04:23:55.720 --> 04:23:56.790 align:start position:0%
any additional funds there laps to the
general

04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
general
 
04:23:59.710 --> 04:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
fund uh same thing with corporations
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
division uh that
 
04:24:03.359 --> 04:24:04.950 align:start position:0%
division uh that
um

04:24:04.950 --> 04:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
all uh Corporation
 
04:24:10.590 --> 04:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
registrations and other types of
 
04:24:13.149 --> 04:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
registrations other than LLC go directly
 
04:24:16.349 --> 04:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
to the general fund corporations runs
 
04:24:20.590 --> 04:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
off of the LLC Revenue that is collected
 
04:24:24.189 --> 04:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
and then uh at the end of each year we
 
04:24:26.309 --> 04:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
lapse uh I think it's at least $5
 
04:24:29.630 --> 04:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
million back uh to the general
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
fund you said there's 44 million of of
 
04:24:36.349 --> 04:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh Securities fines per year no not
 
04:24:38.070 --> 04:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
fines there's there's there's $44
 
04:24:41.070 --> 04:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
million of Securities Revenue okay which
 
04:24:43.590 --> 04:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
is registrations for broker
 
04:24:46.710 --> 04:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
dealers um financial instruments that
 
04:24:48.309 --> 04:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
are being offered in New Hampshire have
 
04:24:51.269 --> 04:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
to pay a registration fee all of that
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
money goes directly to the general fund
 
04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
and some are
 
04:24:57.950 --> 04:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
fines no no okay the fine money that is
 
04:25:01.030 --> 04:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
collected through enforcement actions is
 
04:25:03.389 --> 04:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
retained by the Secretary of State's
 
04:25:06.990 --> 04:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
office to pay the expenses of operating
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
Securities and then any money that is
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
left over uh oh so there's a dedicated
 
04:25:15.149 --> 04:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
fund for that and if it's greater than x
 
04:25:18.910 --> 04:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
it lapses I understand okay now um when
 
04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
were the fees involved in those two
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
things the Securities and corporate
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
registrations when were those
 
04:25:28.830 --> 04:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
set when were they created when were the
 
04:25:30.990 --> 04:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
last change when when they it's been it
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
has been a long time I I do you know I
 
04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't know when they were raised last
 
04:25:37.790 --> 04:25:37.800 align:start position:0%

any fees for many years um it's been
 
04:25:49.429 --> 04:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
over 10 any at least yeah could you find
 
04:25:52.189 --> 04:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
out in detail yeah whatever the history
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
is of these fees right and I assume
 
04:25:57.550 --> 04:25:57.560 align:start position:0%

yeah thank
 
04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
you all right do you want to start
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
should we go back to the beginning and
 
04:26:09.349 --> 04:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
yep wherever you want to go we're happy
 
04:26:11.710 --> 04:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
to answer questions let's start on page
 
04:26:11.720 --> 04:26:16.710 align:start position:0%
to answer questions let's start on page
12

04:26:16.710 --> 04:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:16.720 --> 04:26:24.429 align:start position:0%
 
12

04:26:24.429 --> 04:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:26.830 --> 04:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
04:26:26.840 --> 04:26:31.510 align:start position:0%
okay all right
[Music]

04:26:31.510 --> 04:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:31.520 --> 04:26:34.469 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:26:34.469 --> 04:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:37.590 --> 04:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
um so here we
 
04:26:40.030 --> 04:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
got uh so this is all general fund but
 
04:26:43.870 --> 04:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
you said no nobody's vacant here
 
04:26:48.590 --> 04:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
the the the positions on page 12
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
are the that's the administrative office
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
basically it's my salary the deputy
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
salary the senior Deputy salary and then
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh some of the uh key office staff are
 
04:27:03.389 --> 04:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
also unclassified those are positions
 
04:27:06.189 --> 04:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
that you would expect would change when
 
04:27:09.550 --> 04:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
there's a turnover in uh Secretary of
 
04:27:09.560 --> 04:27:11.149 align:start position:0%
there's a turnover in uh Secretary of
State

04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
State
 
04:27:14.550 --> 04:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
Administration is were some of these un
 
04:27:18.429 --> 04:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
unfilled for part of the year in 2024 or
 
04:27:20.349 --> 04:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
something like that I am not aware of
 
04:27:22.269 --> 04:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
any that were unfilled I'm just asking
 
04:27:24.910 --> 04:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
because like line 12 for example is
 
04:27:29.429 --> 04:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
going up by by $100,000 compared to to
 
04:27:31.630 --> 04:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
2024 so I don't think you're getting
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
that kind of a raise right so that would
 
04:27:34.880 --> 04:27:36.429 align:start position:0%
that kind of a raise right so that would
be

04:27:36.429 --> 04:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:27:36.439 --> 04:27:39.910 align:start position:0%
be
nice

04:27:39.910 --> 04:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
um the senior deputy is uh didn't work
 
04:27:46.830 --> 04:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
probably as many hours in that year and
 
04:27:51.189 --> 04:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
then they're paid by the day yeah um
 
04:27:55.149 --> 04:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
the so the
 
04:27:58.229 --> 04:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
um of course I'm working full-time and
 
04:28:00.550 --> 04:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
Aaron Hennessy is working full-time
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
Patty Lovejoy was in a position called
 
04:28:06.269 --> 04:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
the senior Deputy position which is a
 
04:28:09.070 --> 04:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
statutory position that is authorized to
 
04:28:11.910 --> 04:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
work up to 90 days a year I I don't
 
04:28:15.550 --> 04:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
think think she uh met I don't think she
 
04:28:18.429 --> 04:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
came close to the 90 days so there would
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
have been some uh uh but it's budgeted
 
04:28:24.469 --> 04:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
for 90 days going for right it's it's
 
04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
budgeted for the full amount even
 
04:28:30.510 --> 04:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
250,000 for 90 days that can't be
 
04:28:30.520 --> 04:28:32.950 align:start position:0%
250,000 for 90 days that can't be
right

04:28:32.950 --> 04:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:28:36.309 --> 04:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
no we'll we'll dig dig deeper into that
 
04:28:37.109 --> 04:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sure there's an
 
04:28:38.910 --> 04:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
explanation for yeah because if if some
 
04:28:40.429 --> 04:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
of those could be reduced a little that
 
04:28:42.870 --> 04:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
would help okay
 
04:28:47.229 --> 04:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
and and similarly um I guess benefits is
 
04:28:51.149 --> 04:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
also going up by 100,000 so so it feels
 
04:28:54.830 --> 04:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
like there's more full-time work I guess
 
04:28:56.590 --> 04:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
for some
 
04:29:01.910 --> 04:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
reason um okay or is that yeah okay all
 
04:29:04.149 --> 04:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
right let's go on other anybody else
 
04:29:06.510 --> 04:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
other questions on this page um let's go
 
04:29:12.309 --> 04:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:15.189 --> 04:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
so who is this new
 
04:29:15.199 --> 04:29:18.229 align:start position:0%
so who is this new
position

04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:21.229 --> 04:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
right that's the C's
 
04:29:24.670 --> 04:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
position right on on
 
04:29:29.870 --> 04:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh class 10 on page 115 would be the the
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
position changing the uh
 
04:29:35.950 --> 04:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
assistant oh doing Civics to the
 
04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
classified position what do you mean by
 
04:29:41.149 --> 04:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
Civics the voter education voter and
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:48.429 --> 04:29:48.439 align:start position:0%
Outreach can
 
04:29:51.830 --> 04:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
you can you tell me more about
 
04:29:54.910 --> 04:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
that we've spent a lot of time over the
 
04:29:58.229 --> 04:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
years uh in the
 
04:30:00.750 --> 04:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
elections um meeting the mandates of the
 
04:30:03.070 --> 04:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
help America vote act which includes
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
also training election officials but
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
what we have seen over the last probably
 
04:30:15.149 --> 04:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
10 years is a a uh a decline in the
 
04:30:17.429 --> 04:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
confidence that voters have an election
 
04:30:19.830 --> 04:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of it is their understanding of
 
04:30:23.469 --> 04:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
the process and uh we really have not
 
04:30:26.550 --> 04:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
focused at all on communicating with the
 
04:30:30.950 --> 04:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
voters in the state and uh I believe
 
04:30:33.469 --> 04:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
that is a critical component of the
 
04:30:36.630 --> 04:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
health of our election system to have
 
04:30:39.070 --> 04:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
programs where we do just that
 
04:30:40.870 --> 04:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
especially in light of a lot of the
 
04:30:43.550 --> 04:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
election Law changes that have taken
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
place uh more recently so that's the
 
04:30:50.309 --> 04:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
need for that position so so how would
 
04:30:53.550 --> 04:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.910 --> 04:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
that so what what we're doing is uh we
 
04:31:00.389 --> 04:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
are reaching out to a wide range of
 
04:31:00.399 --> 04:31:01.349 align:start position:0%
are reaching out to a wide range of
voter

04:31:01.349 --> 04:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
voter
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
constituencies some of them are students
 
04:31:07.349 --> 04:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh veterans groups minority groups
 
04:31:11.309 --> 04:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
senior groups disabilities groups and
 
04:31:14.109 --> 04:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
trying to speak speak to them as groups
 
04:31:15.710 --> 04:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
and we're doing a couple of things
 
04:31:19.710 --> 04:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
educating them on voting processes uh
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
which is very important but also as part
 
04:31:24.149 --> 04:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
of that we're trying to encourage them
 
04:31:26.630 --> 04:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
to become actually engaged in the
 
04:31:30.109 --> 04:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
process and think about volunteering as
 
04:31:32.830 --> 04:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
pole workers uh and helping run the
 
04:31:35.109 --> 04:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
elections locally because I mean we're
 
04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
struggling to get people to do those
 
04:31:39.070 --> 04:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
jobs and so we're just trying to
 
04:31:42.550 --> 04:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
invigorate that whole that whole process
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
I see so um getting people to sign up
 
04:31:50.510 --> 04:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
for the um those positions to run for
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
those positions those sixe what are they
 
04:31:56.670 --> 04:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
called ballot supervisor supervisor the
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
checklist yeah so we're not we're not
 
04:32:02.109 --> 04:32:02.119 align:start position:0%
trying to get people to run for offices
 
04:32:04.670 --> 04:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
I mean hopefully you know maybe by
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
talking to them they might become
 
04:32:09.830 --> 04:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
motivated to do that but we are asking
 
04:32:14.229 --> 04:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
people to volunteer just you know help
 
04:32:16.389 --> 04:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
help work as a ballot Clerk or you know
 
04:32:18.030 --> 04:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
there many jobs to do in a polling place
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
on Election Day right
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%

okay corporate
Administration

04:32:46.830 --> 04:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
04:32:50.870 --> 04:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
so um there's a lot of big changes on
 
04:32:54.030 --> 04:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
this page um current
 
04:32:57.670 --> 04:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
expenses you actually spent
 
04:33:03.470 --> 04:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
275 what is that is that printing
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
ballots or something is no no no no so
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
corporations division is
 
04:33:13.990 --> 04:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
the probably the largest division that
 
04:33:16.349 --> 04:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
we have in terms of
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
employees and workload um oh yes you're
 
04:33:22.869 --> 04:33:22.879 align:start position:0%
getting two more employees here I'm
 
04:33:26.830 --> 04:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
sorry there are two more employees being
 
04:33:30.510 --> 04:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
added okay those two those are the
 
04:33:31.990 --> 04:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
conversions that that I was talking
 
04:33:32.000 --> 04:33:34.949 align:start position:0%
conversions that that I was talking
about

04:33:34.949 --> 04:33:34.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.959 --> 04:33:36.670 align:start position:0%
 
earlier

04:33:36.670 --> 04:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
um we have been working on a major
 
04:33:42.310 --> 04:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
overhaul of the
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
uh Software System and
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
database uh in
 
04:33:50.551 --> 04:33:50.561 align:start position:0%
corporations if you recall four years
 
04:33:53.629 --> 04:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
ago uh you know we were having real
 
04:33:56.189 --> 04:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
serious problems with people being able
 
04:33:59.629 --> 04:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
to use the system we had a vendor who
 
04:33:59.639 --> 04:34:01.629 align:start position:0%
to use the system we had a vendor who
was

04:34:01.629 --> 04:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:34:01.639 --> 04:34:03.551 align:start position:0%
was
um

04:34:03.551 --> 04:34:03.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
U incompetent um they they were not uh
 
04:34:11.109 --> 04:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
they were not responsive to the issues
 
04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
and the concerns concerns that we had so
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
we had to bring somebody in stabilize
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
the system and now we're well on our way
 
04:34:23.629 --> 04:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
to uh having a system that is operating
 
04:34:27.470 --> 04:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh without without issues and so you
 
04:34:28.750 --> 04:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
know the complaints that you may have
 
04:34:31.070 --> 04:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
been getting as legislators four years
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
ago simply are not happening now the um
 
04:34:35.789 --> 04:34:35.799 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
transactions of people registering their
 
04:34:40.429 --> 04:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
business it's annual return season right
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
now uh are being done online and so that
 
04:34:46.230 --> 04:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
we have very little foot traffic now
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's coming into the office and
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
um um yeah so with less foot traffic
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't there be fewer employees
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
you're adding two we're we're converting
 
04:35:00.029 --> 04:35:00.039 align:start position:0%
the positions we're not we're not adding
 
04:35:01.670 --> 04:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
there people are already there or there
 
04:35:03.150 --> 04:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
temp there were temps is that what
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
you're saying yeah the the nature of the
 
04:35:09.070 --> 04:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
jobs are changing from um what used to
 
04:35:12.150 --> 04:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
be paper clerks just people filing
 
04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
papers and applications to people that
 
04:35:19.230 --> 04:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
need to be able to offer uh help with
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
the computer system if somebody has a
 
04:35:23.590 --> 04:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
question about online how to take care
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
of something so um that was part of a
 
04:35:28.109 --> 04:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
conversion that we did a few years ago
 
04:35:30.269 --> 04:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
we came and asked the committee if you
 
04:35:31.551 --> 04:35:31.561 align:start position:0%
know we could upgrade some of the
 
04:35:34.349 --> 04:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
positions and as part of that we did uh
 
04:35:37.510 --> 04:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate some positions uh in
 
04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
corporations uh as
 
04:35:44.910 --> 04:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
well um am I missing anything no no okay
 
04:35:46.629 --> 04:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
and you finished buying your software
 
04:35:49.709 --> 04:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
and your Hardware it looks like yeah I
 
04:35:51.949 --> 04:35:51.959 align:start position:0%
mean but that is an ongoing you know
 
04:35:54.349 --> 04:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
there will be ongoing expenses because
 
04:35:57.070 --> 04:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
any database needs to be sure maintained
 
04:35:59.150 --> 04:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
and so you know we have contracts with
 
04:36:01.230 --> 04:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
vendors for that purpose but the bulk of
 
04:36:04.949 --> 04:36:04.959 align:start position:0%
it is gone away okay what is Grants
 
04:36:04.959 --> 04:36:08.590 align:start position:0%
it is gone away okay what is Grants
nonfederal

04:36:08.590 --> 04:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:13.150 --> 04:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
that's the UCC money
 
04:36:16.150 --> 04:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay go go go and explain it yeah
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
um um Uniform Commercial Code which are
 
04:36:22.830 --> 04:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
leans that are filed um historically
 
04:36:25.230 --> 04:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
they had to file with the town and with
 
04:36:28.510 --> 04:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
the state um quite a few probably at
 
04:36:30.670 --> 04:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
least 10 years ago now the law they
 
04:36:33.470 --> 04:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
changed the law and now they only file
 
04:36:36.269 --> 04:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
with the state but we give back to the
 
04:36:40.429 --> 04:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
towns their portion of the fee so once
 
04:36:41.789 --> 04:36:41.799 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year when all the
 
04:36:44.230 --> 04:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
filings have been tabulated um the towns
 
04:36:46.629 --> 04:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
are given this money back um for their
 
04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
portion of the filings and that's that
 
04:36:50.949 --> 04:36:50.959 align:start position:0%
line that's where we take the money from
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
and give it to the towns all right
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
um Jack why don't we find out where that
 
04:37:00.429 --> 04:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
is in the rsas I probably know but okay
 
04:37:00.439 --> 04:37:01.510 align:start position:0%
is in the rsas I probably know but okay
so

04:37:01.510 --> 04:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:05.551 --> 04:37:05.561 align:start position:0%
page 119
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:14.670 --> 04:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
okay so people used to file with
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
towns they got money they don't anymore
 
04:37:21.510 --> 04:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
so we give them money we not doing we
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
basically collect it on behalf of the
 
04:37:25.830 --> 04:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
towns and give it back to them rather
 
04:37:27.629 --> 04:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
than the people have to be filing in two
 
04:37:30.269 --> 04:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
separate places saying yeah yeah yeah do
 
04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
you tell them who filed and all that uh
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
the well the the records can't be
 
04:37:36.869 --> 04:37:36.879 align:start position:0%
searched it's a public record it's a
 
04:37:39.551 --> 04:37:39.561 align:start position:0%
public record okay all right good any
 
04:37:42.150 --> 04:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
other so let's go on
 
04:37:45.230 --> 04:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
um page
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
120 oh what is private local
 
04:37:52.109 --> 04:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
funds on page 120 so
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
this well the drop was because they they
 
04:37:56.109 --> 04:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
bought all their
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
software right and they so the main P
 
04:38:02.349 --> 04:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
what is what is private local funds what
 
04:38:05.830 --> 04:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
mean that's that's the um revenue from
 
04:38:13.510 --> 04:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
um the llc's that is used to run the
 
04:38:15.269 --> 04:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
division and I don't know why it's
 
04:38:16.709 --> 04:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
titled that way we don't make those
 
04:38:17.830 --> 04:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
titles it comes to us from
 
04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
administrative Services
 
04:38:23.429 --> 04:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
okay all right but that's basically
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's basically the charged to to
 
04:38:29.230 --> 04:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
companies for registering yeah
 
04:38:34.910 --> 04:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.470 --> 04:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
dropped from 10 to five that's that is
 
04:38:41.830 --> 04:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
the estimate as the year goes on on that
 
04:38:45.789 --> 04:38:45.799 align:start position:0%
will adjust it's not it's Mo it very
 
04:38:47.429 --> 04:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
most likely won't come in at five it's
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
going to come in like at 10 but it's
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
it's see you know it's it's an ongoing
 
04:38:56.029 --> 04:38:56.039 align:start position:0%
they update it as go that yes it's an
 
04:39:00.510 --> 04:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
expense that's the budgeted expense
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
however it's run off the fees so
 
04:39:04.470 --> 04:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
depending how many fees are collected
 
04:39:06.310 --> 04:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
depends on how much you have to run the
 
04:39:08.310 --> 04:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
division is there a dedicated fund
 
04:39:08.320 --> 04:39:12.470 align:start position:0%
division is there a dedicated fund
involved

04:39:12.470 --> 04:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:15.349 --> 04:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's rest restricted unrestricted
 
04:39:17.109 --> 04:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue I always get those backwards
 
04:39:19.830 --> 04:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's a restricted Revenue Source gotcha
 
04:39:19.840 --> 04:39:20.910 align:start position:0%
it's a restricted Revenue Source gotcha
yeah

04:39:20.910 --> 04:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:39:23.230 --> 04:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
04:39:25.869 --> 04:39:25.879 align:start position:0%
right yeah so it's the expense right
 
04:39:28.949 --> 04:39:28.959 align:start position:0%
there was an this is expense this is not
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
right that's the expense
 
04:39:35.551 --> 04:39:35.561 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah but that's because
 
04:39:38.830 --> 04:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
anyway any I get it you get it okay uh
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
let's go on to where we on page 120
 
04:39:45.000 --> 04:39:48.470 align:start position:0%
let's go on to where we on page 120
um

04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
so in the in the
 
04:39:57.550 --> 04:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
archive um was there vacant positions
 
04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
in um 2024 is that why there's such a
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
smaller number
 
04:40:07.590 --> 04:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
there I believe we had one vacant
 
04:40:09.750 --> 04:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
position in
 
04:40:13.948 --> 04:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
2024 okay but one since all 10 are now
 
04:40:16.910 --> 04:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
there it's yes all positions now yes
 
04:40:18.910 --> 04:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
they're all we don't have any vacant
 
04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
positions currently in the archives okay
 
04:40:24.910 --> 04:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
and is there really work for 10
 
04:40:28.430 --> 04:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
people and more and more
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay so explain what what is the
 
04:40:37.310 --> 04:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:39.948 --> 04:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
um The Archives has you know
 
04:40:41.788 --> 04:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in addition
 
04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
to you know maintaining and and uh and
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
protecting the collections that are up
 
04:40:52.590 --> 04:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
there we have um we have a couple of
 
04:40:56.628 --> 04:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
Staff people that are constantly uh
 
04:40:59.990 --> 04:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
digitizing Records part of that are
 
04:41:03.150 --> 04:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
legislative records and you know I think
 
04:41:04.590 --> 04:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
there's if you get on the legislative
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
website there's an option for you know
 
04:41:09.868 --> 04:41:09.878 align:start position:0%
looking at the history of whole bills
 
04:41:14.390 --> 04:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
well you know it those staff people are
 
04:41:17.190 --> 04:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
um working to bring those digitized
 
04:41:20.350 --> 04:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
records forward but they're also going
 
04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
backward and so there is a a fairly
 
04:41:26.110 --> 04:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
large window of years now where you know
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
the historical data is available and
 
04:41:32.750 --> 04:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
then in addition to that uh we have
 
04:41:35.910 --> 04:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
staff that are managing agency records
 
04:41:39.550 --> 04:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh there's over 100,000 boxes of Records
 
04:41:43.310 --> 04:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
in that facility they are they are in a
 
04:41:47.590 --> 04:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
status that is between the active use of
 
04:41:50.670 --> 04:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
an agency and and when they can be
 
04:41:52.830 --> 04:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
destroyed according to a specific
 
04:41:55.708 --> 04:41:55.718 align:start position:0%
retention schedule that
 
04:41:58.150 --> 04:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
exists there is there are a lot of
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
occasions where an agency needs to
 
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
access some of the files in those boxes
 
04:42:07.190 --> 04:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
and so we manage all of that if if an
 
04:42:09.110 --> 04:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
agency makes a request for people to go
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
retrieve the files
 
04:42:13.628 --> 04:42:13.638 align:start position:0%
pull them deliver them to the agency
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
pick them up when they're done bring
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
them back refile and then part of that
 
04:42:22.030 --> 04:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
process is when the retention schedule
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
arrives uh for Destruction they confirm
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
with the agency that it is okay to
 
04:42:30.750 --> 04:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
destroy those records and then that
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
process takes place and
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
um uh and we make more room obviously in
 
04:42:40.350 --> 04:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
the stacks for more boxes we just
 
04:42:44.230 --> 04:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
upgraded the um inventory computerized
 
04:42:47.310 --> 04:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
inventory system up there and so now
 
04:42:49.550 --> 04:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
we've got a major project going on where
 
04:42:52.510 --> 04:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
we are going through all of the boxes in
 
04:42:55.470 --> 04:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
the archives and doing a reinvent just
 
04:42:56.910 --> 04:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure you know we know where
 
04:43:00.070 --> 04:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
everything is and and that the past
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
retention schedules have been properly
 
04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
met representative wer are you also
 
04:43:10.110 --> 04:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for cataloging all these TV
 
04:43:12.350 --> 04:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
things that are being made in every
 
04:43:14.708 --> 04:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
every committee that you know somebody
 
04:43:16.470 --> 04:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
could say oh we had this bill three
 
04:43:19.230 --> 04:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
other times I want to see all the all
 
04:43:22.270 --> 04:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
the recordings of of the discussion on
 
04:43:24.510 --> 04:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
that bill is that something you have to
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
be responsible for I don't believe we're
 
04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
responsible for that in the in the short
 
04:43:31.628 --> 04:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
term but over time we take the those
 
04:43:33.788 --> 04:43:33.798 align:start position:0%
records uh in the
 
04:43:39.070 --> 04:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
archives um we we have created a state
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
of-the-art digitization center up there
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
and so you know we're doing a lot more
 
04:43:46.670 --> 04:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
with with digital records uh helping
 
04:43:49.708 --> 04:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
smaller agencies digitize their records
 
04:43:51.390 --> 04:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
as well I've been impressed when
 
04:43:53.070 --> 04:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
somebody say oh I saw that from two
 
04:43:55.990 --> 04:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
years ago and I went online and pulled
 
04:43:58.628 --> 04:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
it up wow
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
impressive yeah represent of you yeah
 
04:44:03.430 --> 04:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
just just a comment I remember talking
 
04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
about this digitization effort during
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
capital budget discussions and I
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
remember once we visited Department of
 
04:44:14.110 --> 04:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
justice and it was like the quarter was
 
04:44:17.350 --> 04:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
this wide with boxes stacked as far as
 
04:44:20.190 --> 04:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
the eye could see and not we were so
 
04:44:24.628 --> 04:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
behind on the digitization so I know you
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
you need what you have budgeted here
 
04:44:30.430 --> 04:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
from visualizing
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
it there seems to be
 
04:44:37.150 --> 04:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
no no um budget for equipment wouldn't
 
04:44:39.990 --> 04:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't you generally need more
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
disc drives or more you know storage
 
04:44:45.070 --> 04:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
electronic storage
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
equipment every year well I I we we we
 
04:44:55.390 --> 04:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
pick it up as we need it you know it it
 
04:44:58.110 --> 04:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
um we're in pretty good shape at the
 
04:44:59.590 --> 04:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
moment so there is no re or is that
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
current expense
 
04:45:04.990 --> 04:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
maybe yeah okay um you have a fairly
 
04:45:08.590 --> 04:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
High uh rent that you pay so is there
 
04:45:11.430 --> 04:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
more than buildings more more than just
 
04:45:13.910 --> 04:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
the one where I see you do the recounts
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
or is there other buildings too we get
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
we get charged pretty stiff rent for the
 
04:45:21.190 --> 04:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
use of that building that's just that's
 
04:45:23.830 --> 04:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
it that building I see because it
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
charged for the NX as well this is
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
400,000 Char for the annex as well yeah
 
04:45:30.510 --> 04:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
oh the annex yeah yeah the our
 
04:45:32.110 --> 04:45:32.120 align:start position:0%
corporation's division is housed in the
 
04:45:33.868 --> 04:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
Annex Building we get charged rent there
 
04:45:36.590 --> 04:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
as well of course yeah the AR and the
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
archives building we get charged rent
 
04:45:41.470 --> 04:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
for yeah I mean
 
04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
seems Seems high but that wouldn't be
 
04:45:47.310 --> 04:45:47.320 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't come under archives though
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
right plant and property would be
 
04:45:52.110 --> 04:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere else right that the the annex
 
04:45:54.190 --> 04:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
would be for corporations and and
 
04:45:56.510 --> 04:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
securities but yeah we get charged
 
04:45:58.150 --> 04:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
pretty hefty rent for the archives
 
04:46:00.550 --> 04:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
building yeah it looks like 400,000 a
 
04:46:04.310 --> 04:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
year yeah okay yeah we we get told what
 
04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
to pay input in the budget we that's
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
determined by administrative Services
 
04:46:12.030 --> 04:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right well maybe we'll ask him
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
about that
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.480 --> 04:46:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
122

04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so is this the one
 
04:46:27.120 --> 04:46:28.670 align:start position:0%
um so is this the one
[Music]

04:46:28.670 --> 04:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
where you converted some Consultants to
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:38.510 --> 04:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
that or maybe these Consultants were
 
04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
with the new computer system so
 
04:46:42.638 --> 04:46:44.670 align:start position:0%
with the new computer system so
um

04:46:44.670 --> 04:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
Securities engages in a lot of
 
04:46:48.788 --> 04:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions that's how they
 
04:46:52.030 --> 04:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
collect Their fines and they do have to
 
04:46:54.548 --> 04:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
reach out to all outside consultants and
 
04:46:58.350 --> 04:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
experts for the cases that they bring in
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
addition to that uh the secretary of
 
04:47:02.990 --> 04:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
state is responsible
 
04:47:05.868 --> 04:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
for oversight of the pulled risk
 
04:47:08.430 --> 04:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
organizations under RSA
 
04:47:13.708 --> 04:47:13.718 align:start position:0%
5B and uh we have been engaged in some
 
04:47:15.548 --> 04:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
actions with those
 
04:47:15.558 --> 04:47:17.070 align:start position:0%
actions with those
organizations

04:47:17.070 --> 04:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
04:47:20.030 --> 04:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
um they uh they challenge us a lot in
 
04:47:23.948 --> 04:47:23.958 align:start position:0%
court and you know that has been very
 
04:47:30.030 --> 04:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:33.990 --> 04:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
manage okay why is current expense high
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
in 2024 and not afterward is that also
 
04:47:40.510 --> 04:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
connected to the computer system or
 
04:47:40.520 --> 04:47:42.350 align:start position:0%
connected to the computer system or
something

04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:47:47.190 --> 04:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:49.510 --> 04:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
Consultants uh some some of that would
 
04:47:51.788 --> 04:47:51.798 align:start position:0%
could current expense could be like um
 
04:47:55.590 --> 04:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
not like software but other components
 
04:48:00.548 --> 04:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
um related to technology gotcha
 
04:48:03.270 --> 04:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
04:48:03.280 --> 04:48:04.830 align:start position:0%
okay all
right

04:48:04.830 --> 04:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:48:14.670 --> 04:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:18.350 --> 04:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
so this one um looks like you're losing
 
04:48:21.350 --> 04:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
a Federal grant right um because the
 
04:48:24.830 --> 04:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
general fund component is doubling over
 
04:48:29.910 --> 04:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
27 and the federal grants down 130 or so
 
04:48:42.430 --> 04:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
125 we have had a con contractual
 
04:48:45.628 --> 04:48:45.638 align:start position:0%
arrangements with the federal
 
04:48:48.830 --> 04:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
CDC to share uh information that is
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
collected through the vital records
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
process it's in aggregate form you know
 
04:48:56.190 --> 04:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
there's no personal identifiers that
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
have gone along with that um part of
 
04:49:03.310 --> 04:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
that is uh birth information information
 
04:49:06.430 --> 04:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
related to uh the mother uh and the
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
parents um there has been some action by
 
04:49:13.548 --> 04:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
the legislature recently to pull back on
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
providing that data and if we don't
 
04:49:19.750 --> 04:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
provide the data that you know that the
 
04:49:22.510 --> 04:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
federal government is looking for then
 
04:49:24.150 --> 04:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
the expectation is they they're not
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
going to uh pay us pay us for
 
04:49:28.000 --> 04:49:29.628 align:start position:0%
going to uh pay us pay us for
it

04:49:29.628 --> 04:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:49:31.948 --> 04:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
okay all right and you're and yet you're
 
04:49:34.030 --> 04:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
adding a
 
04:49:36.470 --> 04:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
person it's a conversion again it's
 
04:49:38.310 --> 04:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
04:49:41.590 --> 04:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
conversion conversion I will tell you
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the um division of Vital Records
 
04:49:48.230 --> 04:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
came to the Secretary of State's office
 
04:49:50.948 --> 04:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
in the early 2000s probably around
 
04:49:53.830 --> 04:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
2003 2004 so they've been a part of of
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
the Department of State for at least 20
 
04:49:56.878 --> 04:49:57.750 align:start position:0%
the Department of State for at least 20
years

04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:50:01.948 --> 04:50:01.958 align:start position:0%
now um part of the agreement for taking
 
04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
Bal Records Was
 
04:50:09.788 --> 04:50:09.798 align:start position:0%
reducing the cost and managing the um
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
the agency fund funds for the intended
 
04:50:14.030 --> 04:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
purpose there is a dedicated fund that
 
04:50:16.548 --> 04:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
goes with Vital Records called the vital
 
04:50:19.868 --> 04:50:19.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:21.788 --> 04:50:21.798 align:start position:0%
fund and those
 
04:50:26.990 --> 04:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
funds are to be dedicated to improve the
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
collection uh of the data and the
 
04:50:32.788 --> 04:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
administration of the records primarily
 
04:50:35.110 --> 04:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
with the city and town clerks who are
 
04:50:38.190 --> 04:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
the agents for the state and you know
 
04:50:39.670 --> 04:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
and are responsible for a lot of that
 
04:50:39.680 --> 04:50:41.590 align:start position:0%
and are responsible for a lot of that
information

04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
and so uh we've been successful in doing
 
04:50:46.390 --> 04:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
that we' we've reduced the number of
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
employee employees from when they first
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
came over we've kept the cost down and
 
04:50:57.868 --> 04:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
uh we maintain a healthy balance uh in
 
04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
the fund healthy means right now I think
 
04:51:00.718 --> 04:51:02.030 align:start position:0%
the fund healthy means right now I think
it's

04:51:02.030 --> 04:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's around $3
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
million but we use that to uh create the
 
04:51:12.070 --> 04:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
modules for like bird death marriage
 
04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
data um and the staff at work at vital
 
04:51:18.150 --> 04:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
records are kind of dedicated to each of
 
04:51:20.948 --> 04:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
those areas even though we do cross Trin
 
04:51:25.190 --> 04:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
so um a lot of that money is used for uh
 
04:51:28.390 --> 04:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
software upgrades and Hardware that is
 
04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
used at the local level by the uh Town
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
clerks yeah because I don't see you said
 
04:51:37.150 --> 04:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
it's conversion but I don't see any
 
04:51:40.830 --> 04:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
number going down right so you would
 
04:51:42.750 --> 04:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
think temps would go down or something
 
04:51:49.548 --> 04:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:53.070 --> 04:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
right oh because it's um that that
 
04:51:56.070 --> 04:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
conversion is the position the the
 
04:51:58.510 --> 04:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
individual that's been um working on
 
04:52:00.628 --> 04:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
that is currently housed in corporate in
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
the corporate budget we're sending it
 
04:52:05.948 --> 04:52:05.958 align:start position:0%
over um so the temp in corporate went
 
04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
down um you just don't see it in the
 
04:52:10.868 --> 04:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
vital records piece I see now Vital
 
04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
Records Improvement says that it gets
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
its money from
 
04:52:19.150 --> 04:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
um revolving
 
04:52:21.750 --> 04:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
funds so what are
 
04:52:27.590 --> 04:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
those so whenever a
 
04:52:31.470 --> 04:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
um whenever a person requests a vital
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
record let's say they show up at the at
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
The Archives they pay a fee Bal records
 
04:52:38.350 --> 04:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
and they want a birth certificate or a
 
04:52:39.990 --> 04:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
death certificate there are fees that
 
04:52:41.708 --> 04:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
are atted
 
04:52:46.150 --> 04:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
with that and uh a portion of those fees
 
04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
are diverted to the V record Improvement
 
04:52:52.150 --> 04:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
fund to the extent that the clerks
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
collect those fees in their offices they
 
04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
also retain a portion of the fee for
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
Town use gotcha so make a add that to
 
04:53:05.548 --> 04:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
your list of other fees right to to give
 
04:53:07.948 --> 04:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
it to us in terms of when they were last
 
04:53:11.948 --> 04:53:11.958 align:start position:0%
changed and and what how much they are
 
04:53:14.670 --> 04:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
and I guess where they are in statute
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
04:53:17.280 --> 04:53:19.830 align:start position:0%
okay good
so

04:53:19.830 --> 04:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:19.840 --> 04:53:22.628 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:53:22.628 --> 04:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's so what's the difference between
 
04:53:27.510 --> 04:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
a vital records Improvement employee and
 
04:53:31.470 --> 04:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
a vital records Bureau
 
04:53:33.868 --> 04:53:33.878 align:start position:0%
employee a vital records Improvement
 
04:53:36.510 --> 04:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
employee is paid for out of the vital
 
04:53:38.430 --> 04:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
records Improvement fund and those
 
04:53:40.948 --> 04:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
individuals primarily are
 
04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with data um that is collected
 
04:53:49.310 --> 04:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
as a result of of the fund the other is
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
just employees that are paid for with a
 
04:53:56.470 --> 04:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
combination of general fund and and
 
04:54:00.548 --> 04:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
federal money is one more the inputs and
 
04:54:03.868 --> 04:54:03.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:03.878 --> 04:54:05.788 align:start position:0%
 
or

04:54:05.788 --> 04:54:05.798 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
um well the the the ones that are funded
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
by the Improvement fund or data input
 
04:54:17.910 --> 04:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
the others are are more focused on the
 
04:54:19.350 --> 04:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
activity that would take place whether
 
04:54:21.628 --> 04:54:21.638 align:start position:0%
there was a fund or not those are the
 
04:54:24.750 --> 04:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
ones that are responsible for all of the
 
04:54:27.548 --> 04:54:27.558 align:start position:0%
data related to births let's say and
 
04:54:32.910 --> 04:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.150 --> 04:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
marriages okay all right all right that
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:45.350 --> 04:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%

04:55:10.990 --> 04:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
employee ah oh renie renie renie p
 
04:55:13.230 --> 04:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
show me he's almost 50 I think he's
 
04:55:16.830 --> 04:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
getting close to 50 yeah so you have to
 
04:55:22.150 --> 04:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:25.868 --> 04:55:25.878 align:start position:0%
to okay other questions any other points
 
04:55:28.670 --> 04:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
representive gr thank
 
04:55:33.190 --> 04:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
you um my question I guess is you you
 
04:55:35.948 --> 04:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
collect fees on a number of things that
 
04:55:39.190 --> 04:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
you do and those fees find their way to
 
04:55:42.750 --> 04:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
mostly mostly yes so what we didn't talk
 
04:55:47.788 --> 04:55:47.798 align:start position:0%
about was in the administrative office
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:55.788 --> 04:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
um citizens of New Hampshire come in
 
04:55:57.830 --> 04:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
there for certain things whether it's to
 
04:56:00.430 --> 04:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
get an AOS steel for something
 
04:56:05.310 --> 04:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
overseas um we used to issue things like
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
Hawker um Hawkers licenses Hawkers and
 
04:56:11.110 --> 04:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
peders license we don't do that anymore
 
04:56:14.150 --> 04:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
but um they're they're just
 
04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous fees applications for
 
04:56:19.750 --> 04:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
notary public and justices of the piece
 
04:56:22.070 --> 04:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
and so we collect those
 
04:56:25.150 --> 04:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
fees and they usually find their they
 
04:56:26.750 --> 04:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
not usually they do find their way to
 
04:56:29.230 --> 04:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
the general fund but there are for
 
04:56:31.830 --> 04:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
example notaries and justices of the
 
04:56:34.948 --> 04:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
peace uh we collect the fees we are
 
04:56:35.948 --> 04:56:35.958 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
04:56:38.868 --> 04:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
retain I think it's $100,000 anything
 
04:56:42.310 --> 04:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
over that laps is that allows us to pay
 
04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
for the staff person that administers
 
04:56:50.430 --> 04:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
that and also produce the the manuals to
 
04:56:53.070 --> 04:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
go along with what's needed for the
 
04:56:57.390 --> 04:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
position and so um you know we we manage
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
that and then we have a recount
 
04:57:05.190 --> 04:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
administration fee account monies that
 
04:57:07.390 --> 04:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
are collected when the candidate wants a
 
04:57:09.830 --> 04:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
recount or whatever deposited in that
 
04:57:12.070 --> 04:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
fund I know if that's lapsing or it's
 
04:57:14.990 --> 04:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
non- lapsing um but those monies help
 
04:57:18.150 --> 04:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
pay for the cost of the rec of you know
 
04:57:21.030 --> 04:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
getting people to help conduct a recount
 
04:57:22.990 --> 04:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a large amount of money it's so
 
04:57:26.270 --> 04:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
that gets to my question and I that I
 
04:57:30.270 --> 04:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
want to ask and that is um what are the
 
04:57:33.628 --> 04:57:33.638 align:start position:0%
total fees collected by the state
 
04:57:38.948 --> 04:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:41.830 --> 04:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
up uh let us get that number together
 
04:57:44.750 --> 04:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
for you you know including the money
 
04:57:46.670 --> 04:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
that automatically goes to the general
 
04:57:49.708 --> 04:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative W yeah our thoughts
 
04:57:54.548 --> 04:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
on that some of these fees have been
 
04:57:57.430 --> 04:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
unchanged for 15 20 years in the
 
04:57:59.830 --> 04:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
meantime we're struggling to balance a
 
04:58:03.510 --> 04:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
budget and some of these fees could help
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
help if we increase the amount of money
 
04:58:07.830 --> 04:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
without you know a lot of grief on the
 
04:58:09.270 --> 04:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
people because they pay them like once
 
04:58:12.030 --> 04:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
in a lifetime or something and uh you
 
04:58:14.230 --> 04:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
know and still it might lessen the
 
04:58:16.270 --> 04:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
amount of General funds to operate that
 
04:58:19.708 --> 04:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
agency if if we had fees that help
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
balance it so what we'll do is probably
 
04:58:25.270 --> 04:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
a major adjustment on fees because some
 
04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
of them haven't been adjusted in 15 20
 
04:58:28.000 --> 04:58:30.110 align:start position:0%
of them haven't been adjusted in 15 20
years

04:58:30.110 --> 04:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:58:33.548 --> 04:58:33.558 align:start position:0%
so yeah or 50 anyway I think it's
 
04:58:36.310 --> 04:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
important we know one that's a policy
 
04:58:39.390 --> 04:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
decision yeah all right any other
 
04:58:42.990 --> 04:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
questions no well obviously the labor
 
04:58:45.430 --> 04:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
department is is not very busy because
 
04:58:48.110 --> 04:58:48.120 align:start position:0%

05:19:00.548 --> 05:19:00.558 align:start position:0%
changes in the budget okay you want two
 
05:19:03.190 --> 05:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
and a half M oh you have a handout yeah
 
05:19:07.150 --> 05:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't see that here it is okay
 
05:19:09.230 --> 05:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
excellent why do you want 2 and a half
 
05:19:09.240 --> 05:19:10.708 align:start position:0%
excellent why do you want 2 and a half
million

05:19:10.708 --> 05:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
million
 
05:19:13.910 --> 05:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
more 2 and a half million more thought I
 
05:19:15.910 --> 05:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
was L I know there's no General funds
 
05:19:18.590 --> 05:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
but still it's somebody's funds right I
 
05:19:23.590 --> 05:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
mean sure uh so uh what I guess I'd like
 
05:19:27.470 --> 05:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
to to do to start is to discuss the the
 
05:19:29.548 --> 05:19:29.558 align:start position:0%
two types of Revenue that support the
 
05:19:31.510 --> 05:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
activities of the department yeah let's
 
05:19:33.788 --> 05:19:33.798 align:start position:0%
get into the detail so so we are we are
 
05:19:37.868 --> 05:19:37.878 align:start position:0%
funded 100% by agency income um however
 
05:19:39.628 --> 05:19:39.638 align:start position:0%
that comes from two different uh
 
05:19:42.430 --> 05:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
distinct sources the administration fund
 
05:19:44.868 --> 05:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
and the restricted fund and the
 
05:19:47.390 --> 05:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
administration fund is is described in
 
05:19:49.948 --> 05:19:49.958 align:start position:0%
the workers comp law and it comes from a
 
05:19:53.510 --> 05:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
prata assessment of the budget that you
 
05:19:56.670 --> 05:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
approve as legislature uh it's assessed
 
05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
on all the insurance carriers based on
 
05:20:01.310 --> 05:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
the claims that they paid in the prior
 
05:20:06.110 --> 05:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
year um and so that represents actually
 
05:20:09.910 --> 05:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
87% of our budget request is build to
 
05:20:11.990 --> 05:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
the insurance carriers who write workers
 
05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
comp in the state of New Hampshire so
 
05:20:18.190 --> 05:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
that's as opposed to on premiums correct
 
05:20:22.030 --> 05:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's based on claims paid
 
05:20:25.270 --> 05:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
interesting okay yeah um now the
 
05:20:27.670 --> 05:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
restricted fund on the other hand is
 
05:20:29.548 --> 05:20:29.558 align:start position:0%
described in RSA
 
05:20:33.390 --> 05:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
273 and it comes from the sum of all of
 
05:20:37.510 --> 05:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
the other fees fines certificates
 
05:20:40.390 --> 05:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
licenses every other kind of Revenue
 
05:20:42.590 --> 05:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
that we produce at the labor department
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
that goes into the restricted fund which
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
supports any of our activities not
 
05:20:50.190 --> 05:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
associated with workers comp and then
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
the balance of that fund after we pay
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
our expenses each year goes back to the
 
05:20:57.788 --> 05:20:57.798 align:start position:0%
general fund so I'm I'm happy to report
 
05:21:00.230 --> 05:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
that our four best years in history were
 
05:21:03.030 --> 05:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
the last four years um we've ex
 
05:21:04.590 --> 05:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
historically the Department's turned
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
over uh between 1 and 1 and A5 million
 
05:21:09.708 --> 05:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
and in the last last four years we've
 
05:21:12.548 --> 05:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
turned over either two or three million
 
05:21:14.548 --> 05:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
depending on you know how much how much
 
05:21:14.558 --> 05:21:17.948 align:start position:0%
depending on you know how much how much
we've

05:21:17.948 --> 05:21:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:21.430 --> 05:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
collected okay so you're saying after
 
05:21:25.190 --> 05:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
these expenses of uh 1. something
 
05:21:28.590 --> 05:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
million You' what's left has gone to the
 
05:21:31.110 --> 05:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
general fund of of two to three million
 
05:21:35.190 --> 05:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
correct I understand y okay very good um
 
05:21:37.548 --> 05:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
so uh in preparing our budget uh
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
governor sununu's office provided us
 
05:21:42.110 --> 05:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
with an overall efficiency Target of
 
05:21:46.030 --> 05:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
just over 12 million uh uh we we met
 
05:21:48.350 --> 05:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
that Target and then uh second year of
 
05:21:51.868 --> 05:21:51.878 align:start position:0%
the budget uh he allowed us to increase
 
05:21:55.510 --> 05:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
for certain position costs and we we
 
05:21:57.628 --> 05:21:57.638 align:start position:0%
beat that Target as well in preparing
 
05:22:02.788 --> 05:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
the expense budget um Governor aot uh
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
made only modest adjustments uh she
 
05:22:09.270 --> 05:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
eliminated uh uh roughly 20,00 ,000 in
 
05:22:11.628 --> 05:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
priority needs which actually we did not
 
05:22:15.310 --> 05:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
request it was agencies that we transfer
 
05:22:18.750 --> 05:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
money to that requested that $20,000 so
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
those were eliminated and also there
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
were some um not uncommonly in the
 
05:22:25.030 --> 05:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
governor's phase of the budget there are
 
05:22:28.628 --> 05:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
adjustments made to employee benefits
 
05:22:30.150 --> 05:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
usually a reduction and that's what
 
05:22:33.230 --> 05:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
happened in this case too so very modest
 
05:22:37.470 --> 05:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
um changes uh in Governor aot's budget
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh so in 26 and 27 we have requested no
 
05:22:44.830 --> 05:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
new positions that leaves us at the 87
 
05:22:47.030 --> 05:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh full-time authorized positions as
 
05:22:50.430 --> 05:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
supported in the prior B uh bium that
 
05:22:53.390 --> 05:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
followed uh the abolition of eight
 
05:22:57.190 --> 05:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
positions in the prior bium and uh we
 
05:23:00.750 --> 05:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
did have one position added in the most
 
05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
recent version of House Bill 2 uh the
 
05:23:07.470 --> 05:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
Senate added a program and a position uh
 
05:23:10.670 --> 05:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
for us so so we we ended up with 87
 
05:23:13.310 --> 05:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
full-time authorized positions uh coming
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
into this ban into this biannual budget
 
05:23:20.230 --> 05:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
any vacant I'm sorry vacant on yes we
 
05:23:24.910 --> 05:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
have vacancies okay um I didn't count
 
05:23:28.670 --> 05:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
but SE several are are being recruited
 
05:23:30.590 --> 05:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
and SE several actually been hired I
 
05:23:32.868 --> 05:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
think three yeah have been hired in the
 
05:23:35.310 --> 05:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
last few days in fact um oh so you're
 
05:23:37.830 --> 05:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
not subject to the the hiring for we are
 
05:23:39.868 --> 05:23:39.878 align:start position:0%
but we have way waivers I see we have
 
05:23:42.830 --> 05:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
waivers okay
 
05:23:46.830 --> 05:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
um so uh notable changes in our
 
05:23:49.310 --> 05:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
efficiency request include a slight
 
05:23:52.190 --> 05:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
increase in class 17 special payments
 
05:23:54.830 --> 05:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
which we use to fund uh retirement or
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
termination payouts uh we had
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
significant reductions in our transfers
 
05:24:03.110 --> 05:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
to doit and general Services uh an
 
05:24:05.470 --> 05:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
increase in equipment in year one for
 
05:24:08.750 --> 05:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
the purchase of a new truck to transport
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh to transport our elevator testing
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
weights uh you can imagine uh in when
 
05:24:18.070 --> 05:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
you're testing a new elevator the
 
05:24:20.430 --> 05:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
weights I believe total something like
 
05:24:23.430 --> 05:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
2,500 lb and we're carrying them around
 
05:24:26.070 --> 05:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
in these little sedans that our labor
 
05:24:29.110 --> 05:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
inspectors use so it's uh it's bruising
 
05:24:30.910 --> 05:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
anyway and we we think we'd be better
 
05:24:33.628 --> 05:24:33.638 align:start position:0%
off to dedicate a an appropriate vehicle
 
05:24:35.230 --> 05:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
for that um
 
05:24:39.230 --> 05:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
service huh one way
 
05:24:42.150 --> 05:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure I know I know the total
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
because they have to get up to 2500
 
05:24:46.990 --> 05:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
pounds I think to to do the full test
 
05:24:49.270 --> 05:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
that's a lot ofs correct in and out of
 
05:24:53.830 --> 05:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
the building all the time yeah so um
 
05:24:53.840 --> 05:24:54.788 align:start position:0%
the building all the time yeah so um
let's

05:24:54.788 --> 05:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
let's
 
05:24:59.548 --> 05:24:59.558 align:start position:0%
see oh and uh testing weights and U we
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
also had a significant increase you'll
 
05:25:05.390 --> 05:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
notice in our um Statewide cost
 
05:25:08.708 --> 05:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
allocation plan fund our indirect cost
 
05:25:11.830 --> 05:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
um we have seen that grow in the last
 
05:25:15.190 --> 05:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
three years by about $100,000 a year um
 
05:25:16.948 --> 05:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
so we're health and commissioner Arling
 
05:25:20.310 --> 05:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
house with his
 
05:25:24.948 --> 05:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
needs um let's see we also significantly
 
05:25:27.150 --> 05:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
reduced the budget for part-time
 
05:25:30.948 --> 05:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
temporary staffing um but increased the
 
05:25:33.708 --> 05:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
uh the budget for our administratively
 
05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
attached boards who are paid um on a per
 
05:25:41.430 --> 05:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
DM rate for for their hearings that they
 
05:25:45.670 --> 05:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
hold in our building um and there's a
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
significant increase in year one in our
 
05:25:52.708 --> 05:25:52.718 align:start position:0%
class 103 operational contracts line and
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's because I have I have some
 
05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
building needs that I I think are going
 
05:25:59.110 --> 05:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
to have to be met by local funding in
 
05:26:01.910 --> 05:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
instead of admin administrative services
 
05:26:04.750 --> 05:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
so so we asked for an increase there and
 
05:26:07.270 --> 05:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
that that really concludes what what I
 
05:26:10.628 --> 05:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
had to say about significant changes and
 
05:26:12.750 --> 05:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
offer to take any questions all right
 
05:26:16.708 --> 05:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
well let's get back to why is fiscal
 
05:26:20.350 --> 05:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
year 24 so different than fiscal year
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
25 so that's we UND spent by probably $2
 
05:26:29.070 --> 05:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
million yeah yeah can't you do that
 
05:26:29.080 --> 05:26:31.990 align:start position:0%
million yeah yeah can't you do that
again

05:26:31.990 --> 05:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:35.070 --> 05:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
or I hesitate to say with
 
05:26:41.230 --> 05:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:44.910 --> 05:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
so does that it doesn't help you however
 
05:26:50.670 --> 05:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
um to to any significant degree I see
 
05:26:54.150 --> 05:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
um so in what sense
 
05:26:57.030 --> 05:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
um we have workers comp all throughout
 
05:27:00.310 --> 05:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
the state budget right
 
05:27:03.548 --> 05:27:03.558 align:start position:0%
so does it
 
05:27:06.230 --> 05:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
somehow some of that make its way back
 
05:27:10.310 --> 05:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
to you or no oh well I shouldn't say
 
05:27:14.270 --> 05:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
that I guess it does yeah because we
 
05:27:16.510 --> 05:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
very small probably right it has to do
 
05:27:18.628 --> 05:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
with the ratio of number of state
 
05:27:20.910 --> 05:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
employees compared to all employees or
 
05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
something that St the state's carrier
 
05:27:26.110 --> 05:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
would get a share of our budget they
 
05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
would have to pay a share of our budget
 
05:27:28.958 --> 05:27:29.948 align:start position:0%
would have to pay a share of our budget
I

05:27:29.948 --> 05:27:29.958 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:27:33.628 --> 05:27:33.638 align:start position:0%
see um and did you underspend the budget
 
05:27:36.150 --> 05:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
mainly because of these vacant positions
 
05:27:40.190 --> 05:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
is that um 2024 pretty Frugal I think
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
we're conservative yeah and it's
 
05:27:44.310 --> 05:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
historically the labor department has
 
05:27:49.230 --> 05:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
undp underspent the budget by a good
 
05:27:52.910 --> 05:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
20% Which becomes lapses is well well
 
05:27:55.390 --> 05:27:55.400 align:start position:0%
not really right the not really because
 
05:27:57.990 --> 05:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
the again 87% of the budget is this
 
05:28:00.628 --> 05:28:00.638 align:start position:0%
Administration fund that is uh built out
 
05:28:03.510 --> 05:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
to the insurance carriers but then I am
 
05:28:05.628 --> 05:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
obligated what whatever is left over in
 
05:28:07.510 --> 05:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
that fund I'm obligated to take out of
 
05:28:09.070 --> 05:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
05:28:11.708 --> 05:28:11.718 align:start position:0%
so the carriers get that back if I don't
 
05:28:14.310 --> 05:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
spend it the carriers get it
 
05:28:18.310 --> 05:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
back oh so it's so if we wanted somehow
 
05:28:20.070 --> 05:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
more money it has to come from the
 
05:28:22.868 --> 05:28:22.878 align:start position:0%
restricted fund right which is a very
 
05:28:24.910 --> 05:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
small actually a very small portion of
 
05:28:30.150 --> 05:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
what we do yeah I see okay and are any
 
05:28:32.590 --> 05:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
of the the fees and fines in the
 
05:28:32.600 --> 05:28:33.868 align:start position:0%
of the the fees and fines in the
restricted

05:28:33.868 --> 05:28:33.878 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
05:28:37.788 --> 05:28:37.798 align:start position:0%
fund listed in statute or they oh they
 
05:28:40.390 --> 05:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
are yeah okay yeah all of them in one
 
05:28:43.990 --> 05:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
way or another they are yeah yeah so so
 
05:28:46.150 --> 05:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
like the Civil penalties that we impose
 
05:28:48.390 --> 05:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
say as the result of a wage an hour
 
05:28:50.830 --> 05:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
inspection those civil penalties are
 
05:28:54.830 --> 05:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
capped at $2,500 per violation by
 
05:28:58.628 --> 05:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
Statute um but we you know we have a
 
05:29:00.868 --> 05:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
formula depending on you know whether
 
05:29:03.708 --> 05:29:03.718 align:start position:0%
it's a repeat customer the severity of
 
05:29:06.470 --> 05:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
the infraction so forth to calculate
 
05:29:10.430 --> 05:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
what the Civil penalty should be um but
 
05:29:13.150 --> 05:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
we're capped at $2500 it's it's rare
 
05:29:16.190 --> 05:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
that we actually go to the full
 
05:29:20.270 --> 05:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
$2,500 what do you mean $25 an hour I'm
 
05:29:24.948 --> 05:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
sorry did you say $25 an hour no 20
 
05:29:29.430 --> 05:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
$2500 per violation per violation $2,500
 
05:29:33.110 --> 05:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
per violation oh I see violation that's
 
05:29:35.350 --> 05:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
the maximum that the Labor Commissioner
 
05:29:38.430 --> 05:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
can impose I gotcha but but you have
 
05:29:38.440 --> 05:29:39.830 align:start position:0%
can impose I gotcha but but you have
some

05:29:39.830 --> 05:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:29:42.948 --> 05:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
some internal is this in
 
05:29:45.270 --> 05:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
rules what you do no it's just
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility we we have a rubric for you
 
05:29:52.110 --> 05:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
know so that we treat everyone the same
 
05:29:52.120 --> 05:29:53.750 align:start position:0%
know so that we treat everyone the same
way

05:29:53.750 --> 05:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:29:56.990 --> 05:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
um have have we ever visited before is
 
05:29:59.948 --> 05:29:59.958 align:start position:0%
you know is this a frequent flyer uh so
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth what's the severity
 
05:30:05.910 --> 05:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
did they not pay wages or is this just a
 
05:30:09.150 --> 05:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
paperwork error you know
 
05:30:12.510 --> 05:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
um so so that determines how severe a
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
penalty will
 
05:30:17.310 --> 05:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
impose okay so tell me where in statute
 
05:30:20.670 --> 05:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
that is not now
 
05:30:25.868 --> 05:30:25.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:28.990 --> 05:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
11a that's where the maximum civil
 
05:30:32.030 --> 05:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
penalty language is but throughout our
 
05:30:34.548 --> 05:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
statute the you know the elevators and
 
05:30:36.510 --> 05:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
boiler certificates all of that is set
 
05:30:38.548 --> 05:30:38.558 align:start position:0%
in statute as well
 
05:30:42.070 --> 05:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
has it own schematic right workers comp
 
05:30:44.310 --> 05:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh for example the largest revenue that
 
05:30:47.430 --> 05:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
we have coming out of workers comp are
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh penalties that we impose on the
 
05:30:51.230 --> 05:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
carriers for late
 
05:30:55.470 --> 05:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
reporting uh we are we are allowed to
 
05:30:58.788 --> 05:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
charge them or find them as much as $50
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
a day uh our current rubric we're we're
 
05:31:04.270 --> 05:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
charging them $112 a
 
05:31:11.150 --> 05:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:14.030 --> 05:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
period I see and and that's just your
 
05:31:16.190 --> 05:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
own decision
 
05:31:19.310 --> 05:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
yes because the statute says $50 up to
 
05:31:24.310 --> 05:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
$50 up to up to right I got it all right
 
05:31:26.560 --> 05:31:26.570 align:start position:0%
so we might like you to charge a little
 
05:31:26.570 --> 05:31:30.110 align:start position:0%
so we might like you to charge a little
[Laughter]

05:31:30.110 --> 05:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:31:33.740 --> 05:31:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:33.750 --> 05:31:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:31:34.910 --> 05:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:31:38.548 --> 05:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I get it
 
05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
but there's no but it's not statute
 
05:31:48.310 --> 05:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:53.110 --> 05:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
currently um and many do Char come late
 
05:31:54.990 --> 05:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
report late on this kind of thing yeah
 
05:31:57.708 --> 05:31:57.718 align:start position:0%
yeah and and if I could describe I mean
 
05:32:01.510 --> 05:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
the our interest in that is we we need
 
05:32:06.150 --> 05:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
to know if for example an employer has
 
05:32:08.830 --> 05:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
allowed their workers comp policy to
 
05:32:11.868 --> 05:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
lapse because now we then have workers
 
05:32:14.190 --> 05:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
out there who are unprotected from
 
05:32:16.470 --> 05:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
workplace injuries so we're going to
 
05:32:19.510 --> 05:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
take some kind of action when we know
 
05:32:21.110 --> 05:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know that workers are
 
05:32:24.510 --> 05:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
uncovered uh and if the carrier is
 
05:32:27.150 --> 05:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
delinquent and reporting that condition
 
05:32:30.510 --> 05:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
to us people could be could be working
 
05:32:32.830 --> 05:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
you know I see for a longer period of
 
05:32:35.708 --> 05:32:35.718 align:start position:0%
time uncovered yeah yeah right so it is
 
05:32:37.430 --> 05:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
important it is important it's important
 
05:32:41.310 --> 05:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
for us to know okay yeah and $12 a day
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like much right it's our
 
05:32:47.628 --> 05:32:47.638 align:start position:0%
number one Revenue got is the is the
 
05:32:48.868 --> 05:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
penalties on
 
05:32:50.990 --> 05:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
carriers apart from apart from that
 
05:32:53.230 --> 05:32:53.240 align:start position:0%
administration of
 
05:32:56.788 --> 05:32:56.798 align:start position:0%
course got you representative wer as I
 
05:33:00.030 --> 05:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
recall workers comp is a major part of
 
05:33:01.230 --> 05:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
of your
 
05:33:04.310 --> 05:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
operations I guess you people come to
 
05:33:06.030 --> 05:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
bring the claim to you when you decide
 
05:33:08.670 --> 05:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's valid or not we we provide
 
05:33:11.070 --> 05:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
a forum when there's a dispute between
 
05:33:13.628 --> 05:33:13.638 align:start position:0%
the the injured worker uh and the
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier we we provide the
 
05:33:18.070 --> 05:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
forum for deciding that and then there's
 
05:33:20.510 --> 05:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
also an administratively attached board
 
05:33:23.830 --> 05:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
who will hear appeals of our decisions
 
05:33:25.548 --> 05:33:25.558 align:start position:0%
as well and they are they operate in our
 
05:33:27.948 --> 05:33:27.958 align:start position:0%
building are these generally short term
 
05:33:30.430 --> 05:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
and the person recovers or is it
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes permanent damage oh it can be
 
05:33:35.110 --> 05:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
for sure for sure and then do they
 
05:33:37.310 --> 05:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
continue to collect work as comp if if
 
05:33:41.350 --> 05:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
they hav permanent damage um settlements
 
05:33:43.150 --> 05:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
R yeah
 
05:33:46.350 --> 05:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
there's sorry there there are um it's a
 
05:33:50.430 --> 05:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
possibility if an injured worker has a
 
05:33:54.030 --> 05:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
disability a work resultant disability
 
05:33:56.070 --> 05:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
um in which a medical provider has
 
05:33:59.030 --> 05:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
determined that they are not they're not
 
05:34:00.628 --> 05:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
sufficiently released to return to work
 
05:34:01.788 --> 05:34:01.798 align:start position:0%
it's conceivable that they could
 
05:34:03.868 --> 05:34:03.878 align:start position:0%
continue to collect um what we would
 
05:34:05.670 --> 05:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
call those cash benefits paid for by the
 
05:34:07.948 --> 05:34:07.958 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier um for a long long
 
05:34:10.150 --> 05:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
period of time individuals who have
 
05:34:13.230 --> 05:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
partial disabilities um Can time out on
 
05:34:15.190 --> 05:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
those payments those don't necessarily
 
05:34:17.868 --> 05:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
last longer than uh five years and some
 
05:34:20.830 --> 05:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
change 262 weeks I had one person
 
05:34:23.350 --> 05:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
complain to me that he collected work as
 
05:34:25.990 --> 05:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
comp for a while and in one job and went
 
05:34:28.350 --> 05:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
to another job and he collected work as
 
05:34:29.948 --> 05:34:29.958 align:start position:0%
comp there and he said tried to get a
 
05:34:32.708 --> 05:34:32.718 align:start position:0%
third job everybody seemed to know that
 
05:34:34.948 --> 05:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
he collected work as comp so is that
 
05:34:37.788 --> 05:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
something that's publicly available
 
05:34:39.510 --> 05:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
claim information is yeah claim
 
05:34:41.910 --> 05:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
information is protected by Statute so
 
05:34:43.830 --> 05:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
IND you know the the information that
 
05:34:45.670 --> 05:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor holds relative
 
05:34:48.750 --> 05:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
to a particular person's claims uh in
 
05:34:50.590 --> 05:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
the absence of a specific release from
 
05:34:52.350 --> 05:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
that person isn't something we're able
 
05:34:53.708 --> 05:34:53.718 align:start position:0%
to share maybe it's something they've
 
05:34:56.270 --> 05:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
got to put on the job application but he
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
said that seemed to be the reason why he
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't get hired in a third job
 
05:35:05.150 --> 05:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
because he collected twice sure so I
 
05:35:07.190 --> 05:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
guess some people scam it thank you
 
05:35:10.110 --> 05:35:10.120 align:start position:0%
represent Griffin uh thank you thank you
 
05:35:13.510 --> 05:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh on page five
 
05:35:16.270 --> 05:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
of your handout you U talk about the
 
05:35:16.280 --> 05:35:17.590 align:start position:0%
of your handout you U talk about the
Inspection

05:35:17.590 --> 05:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
Inspection
 
05:35:20.510 --> 05:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
Division they uh check establishments
 
05:35:23.868 --> 05:35:23.878 align:start position:0%
for compliance with employment laws they
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
respond to complaints M would those be
 
05:35:28.708 --> 05:35:28.718 align:start position:0%
complaints from
 
05:35:31.230 --> 05:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
employees typically and what would the
 
05:35:34.788 --> 05:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
nature of those complaints be wasn't
 
05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
paid wasn't paid on time uh um my
 
05:35:42.548 --> 05:35:42.558 align:start position:0%
12-year-old son is working 40 hours a
 
05:35:46.470 --> 05:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
week um you name it the the the gamut
 
05:35:49.270 --> 05:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
how about uh things like
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
uh uh discrimination based on age or we
 
05:35:56.788 --> 05:35:56.798 align:start position:0%
we will get those kinds of complaints
 
05:35:59.190 --> 05:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
but they fall with the Human Rights
 
05:36:01.868 --> 05:36:01.878 align:start position:0%
Commission discrimination CLA we have
 
05:36:03.548 --> 05:36:03.558 align:start position:0%
very very
 
05:36:06.310 --> 05:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
limited um uh purview over
 
05:36:08.030 --> 05:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination of any
 
05:36:11.510 --> 05:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
right well the reason I asked is because
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the Human Rights
 
05:36:16.070 --> 05:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
Commission that just said the worst
 
05:36:19.350 --> 05:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
audit we've ever seen and I I read it
 
05:36:22.750 --> 05:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
and uh it's just incredible people make
 
05:36:24.310 --> 05:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
complaints and then they lose their
 
05:36:26.070 --> 05:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
right to go to court because they're not
 
05:36:28.350 --> 05:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
dealt with for three
 
05:36:31.708 --> 05:36:31.718 align:start position:0%
years and I wondered whether you guys
 
05:36:34.070 --> 05:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
could take up the
 
05:36:37.628 --> 05:36:37.638 align:start position:0%
slack it's it's not it's not our St
 
05:36:40.350 --> 05:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
statue it's not within our purview um
 
05:36:43.070 --> 05:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
until you make it our purview than gu
 
05:36:45.070 --> 05:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for
 
05:36:50.670 --> 05:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
sure okay um other questions yeah so I'm
 
05:36:55.230 --> 05:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
interested in this um taxing the claims
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
rather than the the
 
05:37:02.670 --> 05:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
premiums I'm wondering yeah I think uh
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh has an identical um
 
05:37:08.230 --> 05:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
something very similar very similar
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
language in their um in their statute
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
and their their funding mechanism but
 
05:37:14.548 --> 05:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't we hear from them that
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
they get money from premiums and not and
 
05:37:19.030 --> 05:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
not from
 
05:37:22.470 --> 05:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
claims yeah I remember reading their
 
05:37:25.270 --> 05:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
statute years ago and I thought it it it
 
05:37:27.628 --> 05:37:27.638 align:start position:0%
sounded like they created us at exactly
 
05:37:29.750 --> 05:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
the same time because because the
 
05:37:32.788 --> 05:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
language read almost exactly the same
 
05:37:35.190 --> 05:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
but but it could well be that their
 
05:37:38.310 --> 05:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
their formula is different so Melissa
 
05:37:42.030 --> 05:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
can you compare those maybe yeah because
 
05:37:44.830 --> 05:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
I I'd be interested because it's it's
 
05:37:46.990 --> 05:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering you know I'm sure
 
05:37:49.948 --> 05:37:49.958 align:start position:0%
you don't consciously act in one way or
 
05:37:53.548 --> 05:37:53.558 align:start position:0%
another right but but it does sort of
 
05:37:55.590 --> 05:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
put you on the side of the
 
05:37:58.030 --> 05:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
claim receive the person who receives
 
05:37:59.910 --> 05:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
the claim as opposed
 
05:38:04.030 --> 05:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
to a little bit less neutral right
 
05:38:07.150 --> 05:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
so the which the premium might be so I
 
05:38:11.350 --> 05:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
don't know um yeah I well I don't I mean
 
05:38:13.990 --> 05:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
you'll approve a budget I I hope you'll
 
05:38:16.190 --> 05:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
approve a budget for the labor
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
department sure uh uh and then the the
 
05:38:23.310 --> 05:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
only use for the claims data is to
 
05:38:25.830 --> 05:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
decide how much each carrier is going to
 
05:38:30.150 --> 05:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
pay so the income to me is going to be
 
05:38:33.310 --> 05:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
identical regard regardless of who pays
 
05:38:35.750 --> 05:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
oh I see so you take your budget and
 
05:38:38.270 --> 05:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
divide and divide it up among all these
 
05:38:40.830 --> 05:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
carriers based on how many claims
 
05:38:43.190 --> 05:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
they're paying exactly and otherwise it
 
05:38:45.150 --> 05:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
could be based on how much premiums they
 
05:38:47.510 --> 05:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
charge for example yeah I I mean you
 
05:38:49.548 --> 05:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
could you could find which is the way I
 
05:38:51.270 --> 05:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
think I think in the back of my mind
 
05:38:53.548 --> 05:38:53.558 align:start position:0%
that's what the insurance department
 
05:38:56.708 --> 05:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
does okay representative Griffin see I I
 
05:39:00.390 --> 05:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
see it just the opposite I by basing on
 
05:39:03.270 --> 05:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
claims you're encouraging the uh
 
05:39:09.628 --> 05:39:09.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:12.708 --> 05:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
yeah then they get a l lower I I would
 
05:39:16.590 --> 05:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
say though to based on the the amount of
 
05:39:19.830 --> 05:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
losses that insurance carriers pay my
 
05:39:23.390 --> 05:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
budget is an afterthought yeah our but
 
05:39:25.030 --> 05:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
our budget is so much smaller that's
 
05:39:27.190 --> 05:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
such a tiny percentage of their cost and
 
05:39:28.628 --> 05:39:28.638 align:start position:0%
that's the same thing in the insurance
 
05:39:30.910 --> 05:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
department they're they're one and a
 
05:39:32.628 --> 05:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
half perent or something I don't know
 
05:39:34.350 --> 05:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
it's very tiny
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all right other questions
 
05:39:37.680 --> 05:39:39.070 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all right other questions
representative

05:39:39.070 --> 05:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:39:42.868 --> 05:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
Lehman thanks Mr chairman I I apologize
 
05:39:45.270 --> 05:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
just for the minutes it's Maryfield
 
05:39:47.548 --> 05:39:47.558 align:start position:0%
right yes oh I'm sorry D didn't even say
 
05:39:49.670 --> 05:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
my name you you might have but but then
 
05:39:52.230 --> 05:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
I went to your website to try to find it
 
05:39:56.590 --> 05:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't find any ref to you
 
05:39:59.548 --> 05:39:59.558 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I know some of us use that as
 
05:40:02.190 --> 05:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
an advertising
 
05:40:04.350 --> 05:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
opport but there was something I came
 
05:40:06.150 --> 05:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
across here I had a question what is
 
05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
employee leas
 
05:40:11.948 --> 05:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
sing such a I'll I'll let you such a
 
05:40:14.430 --> 05:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
very excellent question so in New
 
05:40:16.628 --> 05:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a specific statute
 
05:40:18.190 --> 05:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
that's administered through the
 
05:40:20.270 --> 05:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor that provides for
 
05:40:23.190 --> 05:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
certain requirements and Licensing of
 
05:40:24.788 --> 05:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
what are called employee leasing
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
companies or um peos uh professional
 
05:40:30.788 --> 05:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
employment organizations oh so like an
 
05:40:33.510 --> 05:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
employment agency type of thing or temp
 
05:40:36.190 --> 05:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
temp somewhat different so a temp agency
 
05:40:38.868 --> 05:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
is an employer in its own right it takes
 
05:40:40.590 --> 05:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
you know it has its own employees and
 
05:40:43.070 --> 05:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
then essentially contracts out or or or
 
05:40:45.070 --> 05:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
Farms out those employees to work at
 
05:40:47.310 --> 05:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
like a host company when we're talking
 
05:40:49.868 --> 05:40:49.878 align:start position:0%
about peos or leasing companies engaging
 
05:40:52.070 --> 05:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
in relationships with client companies
 
05:40:54.788 --> 05:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
under the law if you're with a licensed
 
05:40:56.830 --> 05:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
um organization and that licensure does
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
come through the department it's one of
 
05:41:01.110 --> 05:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
the fees that we charge for applications
 
05:41:03.110 --> 05:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
and then issuance of said license it's
 
05:41:05.070 --> 05:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
creating a co-employment relationship
 
05:41:06.910 --> 05:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
where both the peo and then the client
 
05:41:06.920 --> 05:41:07.788 align:start position:0%
where both the peo and then the client
come

05:41:07.788 --> 05:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
come
 
05:41:10.670 --> 05:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
are responsible for certain um labor
 
05:41:13.670 --> 05:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
oriented rights under under the statute
 
05:41:16.830 --> 05:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
so it creates a very unique employment
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
scenario that is regulated through the
 
05:41:22.628 --> 05:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
department thanks thanks chairman what's
 
05:41:27.310 --> 05:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
an example of that um so an example
 
05:41:31.708 --> 05:41:31.718 align:start position:0%
would be I believe um
 
05:41:37.230 --> 05:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
ADP is paychecks paychecks are peos um
 
05:41:39.830 --> 05:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
people people source is a peo and and
 
05:41:41.350 --> 05:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
essentially when we you know when you
 
05:41:43.070 --> 05:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
look at the statutory requirement this
 
05:41:46.230 --> 05:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
peo almost operates or serves as the
 
05:41:47.990 --> 05:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
centralized almost like human resources
 
05:41:49.430 --> 05:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
so they're responsible for putting
 
05:41:52.350 --> 05:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
together policies for the client company
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
administering payroll assuring that the
 
05:41:56.510 --> 05:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
insurance um policies inclusive of
 
05:41:58.750 --> 05:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
workers compensation are obtained are
 
05:42:01.430 --> 05:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
and in place uh for what for the
 
05:42:04.390 --> 05:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
employees who are under the care and
 
05:42:06.868 --> 05:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
control of the client company so company
 
05:42:09.788 --> 05:42:09.798 align:start position:0%
X engages in the relationship with um
 
05:42:12.990 --> 05:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
ADP company X is directing the employees
 
05:42:14.830 --> 05:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
might be setting the rate of pay for
 
05:42:16.910 --> 05:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
those employees uh the peo is going to
 
05:42:18.430 --> 05:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
make sure the grievance policies are in
 
05:42:22.190 --> 05:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
place the notifications um about pay and
 
05:42:25.110 --> 05:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
and hiring have gone out um that workers
 
05:42:27.350 --> 05:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
comp is in place that payroll is coming
 
05:42:28.708 --> 05:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
on time and is administered
 
05:42:30.468 --> 05:42:30.478 align:start position:0%
appropriately so they share employment
 
05:42:32.750 --> 05:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and each is responsible
 
05:42:35.990 --> 05:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
by law um for their designated portion
 
05:42:38.590 --> 05:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
in order for those peos to operate
 
05:42:40.390 --> 05:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
legally in our state they do have to be
 
05:42:42.670 --> 05:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
licensed they're vetted there's certain
 
05:42:45.468 --> 05:42:45.478 align:start position:0%
um security requirements or or or
 
05:42:47.230 --> 05:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
Securities that we want to see or that
 
05:42:50.750 --> 05:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
the statute wants to see um on on file
 
05:42:53.270 --> 05:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
and then they renew I want to say every
 
05:42:54.750 --> 05:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
two years and then if they're in good
 
05:42:57.468 --> 05:42:57.478 align:start position:0%
standing for some period of time they
 
05:43:02.948 --> 05:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
period it's a very unique um
 
05:43:08.990 --> 05:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
situation and is often Mis uh confused
 
05:43:11.430 --> 05:43:11.440 align:start position:0%

05:43:49.840 --> 05:43:51.868 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:43:51.868 --> 05:43:51.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:43:55.548 --> 05:43:55.558 align:start position:0%
where oh page 57 of house B
 
05:43:58.190 --> 05:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
okay we only have it in draft we don't
 
05:44:03.628 --> 05:44:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:07.270 --> 05:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
ahead you want me to take you through
 
05:44:11.270 --> 05:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
our yes go ahead if you have it okay um
 
05:44:13.910 --> 05:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
we we were alerted our first section I
 
05:44:15.510 --> 05:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
think has to do with wage claim
 
05:44:18.430 --> 05:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
settlements in wage W wage claim
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
settlement account and uh we we were
 
05:44:26.830 --> 05:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
alerted by uh Bureau of accounts uh uh
 
05:44:29.510 --> 05:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of last fiscal year that we
 
05:44:32.548 --> 05:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
didn't have statutory authority to do
 
05:44:35.830 --> 05:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
what we were doing uh and in essence
 
05:44:38.830 --> 05:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're we have a holding account
 
05:44:42.110 --> 05:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
for wages that are turned over to us and
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
we can't locate the employee so we we
 
05:44:48.510 --> 05:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
hold that and it's not it's not property
 
05:44:50.590 --> 05:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
of the state so we don't lapse it we
 
05:44:52.670 --> 05:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
don't turn it over to the state at the
 
05:44:54.628 --> 05:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
end of the fiscal year so this was just
 
05:44:57.030 --> 05:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
to clarify that language so that we
 
05:45:00.110 --> 05:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
could maintain those those wages for for
 
05:45:03.830 --> 05:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
the employees and so we can find them do
 
05:45:06.190 --> 05:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
you turn them over after 10 years of
 
05:45:07.830 --> 05:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
looking or something
 
05:45:09.990 --> 05:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
property abandoned property eventually
 
05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
gets it yeah yeah I see okay um then uh
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
number two we had a special Fund in the
 
05:45:23.350 --> 05:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
workers comp law uh that was a an effort
 
05:45:25.670 --> 05:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
by the legislature to hold harmless when
 
05:45:28.708 --> 05:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
there was an overhaul of the workers
 
05:45:31.468 --> 05:45:31.478 align:start position:0%
comp statute they wanted to hold certain
 
05:45:34.270 --> 05:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
Active cases harmless so that people
 
05:45:36.310 --> 05:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't see a change in their
 
05:45:36.320 --> 05:45:37.670 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't see a change in their
benefits

05:45:37.670 --> 05:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
05:45:41.590 --> 05:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
the the last recipient uh from that
 
05:45:44.590 --> 05:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
special fund has passed away and so we
 
05:45:50.070 --> 05:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:53.110 --> 05:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
Statute what else do I
 
05:45:56.390 --> 05:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
have number three insurance
 
05:45:59.548 --> 05:45:59.558 align:start position:0%
carriers oh yes Danielle you're more
 
05:46:03.190 --> 05:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
expert on this uh so number three um is
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh proposing to make an amendment to um
 
05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
the workers compensation statute
 
05:46:10.670 --> 05:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
specifically the section 43 which talks
 
05:46:13.190 --> 05:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
about hearings and awards um several
 
05:46:15.390 --> 05:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
years ago back in 2006 there was an
 
05:46:18.190 --> 05:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to that statute that altered
 
05:46:20.548 --> 05:46:20.558 align:start position:0%
the compliance time frame that insurance
 
05:46:24.350 --> 05:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
carriers had to issue payment of ordered
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
payment of cash benefits to Injured
 
05:46:30.070 --> 05:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
Workers it changed the language from um
 
05:46:32.628 --> 05:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
it requiring the insurance carriers to
 
05:46:34.628 --> 05:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
pay Injured Workers if ordered to do so
 
05:46:37.510 --> 05:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
within 5 days of issuance of a decision
 
05:46:41.548 --> 05:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
um to 30 plus 5 days um the department
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
and all of the participants in these
 
05:46:46.510 --> 05:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
hearing processes continued for up until
 
05:46:48.390 --> 05:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
very recently to operate under the
 
05:46:48.400 --> 05:46:49.708 align:start position:0%
very recently to operate under the
former

05:46:49.708 --> 05:46:49.718 align:start position:0%
former
 
05:46:51.990 --> 05:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
language um when it came to our
 
05:46:54.708 --> 05:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
attention that we were not administering
 
05:46:57.670 --> 05:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
it correctly um we did take steps to
 
05:46:58.948 --> 05:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
make the change however that has
 
05:47:01.310 --> 05:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
resulted in delay of payment to Injured
 
05:47:03.350 --> 05:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
Workers who are awaiting an appeal
 
05:47:06.310 --> 05:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
process um it it makes them wait longer
 
05:47:08.110 --> 05:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
to get the money that's resulted in an
 
05:47:09.948 --> 05:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
increase on Outreach about delayed
 
05:47:11.590 --> 05:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
payment and hardship and things of that
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
nature so given the fact that the
 
05:47:15.910 --> 05:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
participants were operating under the
 
05:47:17.310 --> 05:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
former language the Department's been
 
05:47:18.590 --> 05:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
operating under the former language
 
05:47:21.670 --> 05:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
we're proposing to um mend that language
 
05:47:23.230 --> 05:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
to have it go back to 5 days from a
 
05:47:23.240 --> 05:47:25.110 align:start position:0%
to have it go back to 5 days from a
department

05:47:25.110 --> 05:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:47:29.708 --> 05:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
decision sounds good okay and then the
 
05:47:33.910 --> 05:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
the next don't blessing Ken um the uh
 
05:47:35.548 --> 05:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
the next section has to do with the
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
composition of the workers compensation
 
05:47:40.708 --> 05:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
appeal board in the last version of
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 we reduced the overall size
 
05:47:46.150 --> 05:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
of that board because the volume is just
 
05:47:50.468 --> 05:47:50.478 align:start position:0%
not quite the same this this sort of
 
05:47:52.590 --> 05:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
normalizes the language it really it
 
05:47:55.030 --> 05:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any change to anything but
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
the the the law as it now now stands
 
05:48:00.468 --> 05:48:00.478 align:start position:0%
says on thus date uh the commissioner
 
05:48:03.270 --> 05:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
shall reduce the board from this I so it
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
was it was awkward to leave in there in
 
05:48:09.310 --> 05:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
that state is changing the the language
 
05:48:11.390 --> 05:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
to be more reflective of the current
 
05:48:13.468 --> 05:48:13.478 align:start position:0%
circumstances we had another one that
 
05:48:17.830 --> 05:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
had a problem because of the way that um
 
05:48:17.840 --> 05:48:18.750 align:start position:0%
had a problem because of the way that um
the

05:48:18.750 --> 05:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:48:22.150 --> 05:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
board somebody moved like out of state
 
05:48:25.948 --> 05:48:25.958 align:start position:0%
but there their board position was like
 
05:48:29.430 --> 05:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
for five years or until they resign and
 
05:48:32.670 --> 05:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
the guy never resigned right but he was
 
05:48:34.590 --> 05:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
not showing up either I don't know if
 
05:48:36.830 --> 05:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
your language has has any kind of
 
05:48:39.628 --> 05:48:39.638 align:start position:0%
problems like that maybe we should look
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
into that do you remember Melissa this
 
05:48:45.390 --> 05:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
other board um no no you know you're
 
05:48:47.150 --> 05:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
looking blank
 
05:48:50.830 --> 05:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
so okay I I'll see if I can was it
 
05:48:54.030 --> 05:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
land was it land was it that one I don't
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
know I thought it was something else in
 
05:49:00.590 --> 05:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:00.600 --> 05:49:02.270 align:start position:0%
 
too

05:49:02.270 --> 05:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:49:05.230 --> 05:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um all right well we'll think about
 
05:49:07.430 --> 05:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
that or maybe it was a bill
 
05:49:09.910 --> 05:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
right maybe it might have been a
 
05:49:12.948 --> 05:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think anything in hb2 is
 
05:49:15.110 --> 05:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
about that we had Public Employee labor
 
05:49:16.788 --> 05:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
relation board speak about a fee that
 
05:49:20.350 --> 05:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
was in hb2 but I to my no this is like
 
05:49:22.830 --> 05:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
changing maybe it's just a bill I saw
 
05:49:26.190 --> 05:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
but it had to do with um the members of
 
05:49:29.548 --> 05:49:29.558 align:start position:0%
a board right and and for some
 
05:49:32.670 --> 05:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
reason they had problems because like I
 
05:49:35.030 --> 05:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
said somebody like retired and moved out
 
05:49:37.150 --> 05:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
of state but never gave up their board
 
05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
position and the way the the the thing
 
05:49:41.830 --> 05:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
was written was the governor couldn't
 
05:49:45.230 --> 05:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
reappoint this person until they quit
 
05:49:47.468 --> 05:49:47.478 align:start position:0%
right and and so even though they were
 
05:49:49.628 --> 05:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
gone you know what I mean so anyways I
 
05:49:51.350 --> 05:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'll see if I can find it may have been
 
05:49:53.230 --> 05:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
flood control because we couldn't ever
 
05:49:55.190 --> 05:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
get a quorum and someone wasn't showing
 
05:49:58.150 --> 05:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
up oh okay yeah I'll see if I can find
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
it I think it was a bill all right yeah
 
05:50:04.468 --> 05:50:04.478 align:start position:0%
that'll be on me let's let me make a
 
05:50:11.948 --> 05:50:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:15.150 --> 05:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
redo just for the committee's sake
 
05:50:17.788 --> 05:50:17.798 align:start position:0%
um we're going to get a list from the
 
05:50:21.150 --> 05:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
speaker's office of like 15 commissions
 
05:50:24.110 --> 05:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
to get rid of because they're not
 
05:50:26.110 --> 05:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
meeting you know I mean it's one of
 
05:50:28.070 --> 05:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
these things where I'm sure you're
 
05:50:30.310 --> 05:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
you're on a bunch of commissions that uh
 
05:50:33.910 --> 05:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
for sure yeah but probably you don't
 
05:50:36.110 --> 05:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
have to be or don't want to or something
 
05:50:37.910 --> 05:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
05:50:42.430 --> 05:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
or shouldn't be or shouldn't yeah right
 
05:50:47.070 --> 05:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
um Governor's Point okay go ahead next
 
05:50:50.150 --> 05:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
one sure uh and then the next section
 
05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
that we're asking for is to make um make
 
05:50:56.628 --> 05:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
it clear that the the records and
 
05:50:58.910 --> 05:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings of the workers comp appeals
 
05:51:01.270 --> 05:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
board that is administratively attached
 
05:51:03.390 --> 05:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
to us to make it clear that those
 
05:51:06.750 --> 05:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
records are all confidential as well um
 
05:51:08.548 --> 05:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has a different
 
05:51:12.070 --> 05:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
opinion than we do about the
 
05:51:14.910 --> 05:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
overriding confidentiality Statute in
 
05:51:17.110 --> 05:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
the workers comp law we just this is
 
05:51:19.070 --> 05:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
just to make it clear that that board
 
05:51:21.750 --> 05:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
that appell at board is also
 
05:51:25.510 --> 05:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
confidential um and the next section is
 
05:51:29.830 --> 05:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
just um uh removing uh gender specific
 
05:51:32.510 --> 05:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
language relative to the commissioner
 
05:51:35.990 --> 05:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
because someday it could be Danielle so
 
05:51:36.000 --> 05:51:37.590 align:start position:0%
because someday it could be Danielle so
MH

05:51:37.590 --> 05:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
MH
 
05:51:42.468 --> 05:51:42.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:47.070 --> 05:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
right um and let's see hearing oh do you
 
05:51:48.788 --> 05:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
want to talk about them the hearing
 
05:51:52.030 --> 05:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
notices so so the next one is um looking
 
05:51:54.190 --> 05:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
to make a change to the way that workers
 
05:51:56.390 --> 05:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
compensation hearing notices issues to
 
05:51:59.110 --> 05:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
parties uh when electronic issuance is
 
05:52:01.788 --> 05:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
at issue currently the statute
 
05:52:03.830 --> 05:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
authorizes electronic issuance which
 
05:52:05.230 --> 05:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
would include via email which is
 
05:52:07.670 --> 05:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
currently a a very you know postco an
 
05:52:09.868 --> 05:52:09.878 align:start position:0%
incredibly popular method and modality
 
05:52:12.070 --> 05:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
of communication only authorizes the
 
05:52:13.270 --> 05:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
department to serve notice
 
05:52:15.070 --> 05:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
electronically when both parties give
 
05:52:17.190 --> 05:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
Express consent to receive
 
05:52:19.510 --> 05:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
electronically um there are times when
 
05:52:21.390 --> 05:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
the frequent times when the department
 
05:52:24.510 --> 05:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
can't get parties to respond um we will
 
05:52:27.270 --> 05:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
issue the notice both by regular mail
 
05:52:28.590 --> 05:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
and then by email because we have at
 
05:52:30.868 --> 05:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
least one email address on file from one
 
05:52:33.150 --> 05:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
of the parties um when notices do come
 
05:52:35.868 --> 05:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
back as undeliverable and oddly enough
 
05:52:40.350 --> 05:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
they frequently do uh then um we have
 
05:52:42.110 --> 05:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
difficulty issuing electronically even
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
if we have a uh email address on file if
 
05:52:47.670 --> 05:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
we can't get the consent from the other
 
05:52:49.230 --> 05:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
party or can't get them to respond in a
 
05:52:51.150 --> 05:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
timely manner that causes delays it's
 
05:52:53.868 --> 05:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
additional Staffing time to process both
 
05:52:55.788 --> 05:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
the mail process the return mail and
 
05:52:57.390 --> 05:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
then try to get good contact information
 
05:52:59.110 --> 05:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
or get someone to respond for electric
 
05:53:00.910 --> 05:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
is uh electronic issuance from both
 
05:53:02.868 --> 05:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
parties so it proposes to allow the
 
05:53:05.948 --> 05:53:05.958 align:start position:0%
department to um issue electronically to
 
05:53:08.230 --> 05:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
one party when that party consents so
 
05:53:10.670 --> 05:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
long as notice is made to both parties
 
05:53:14.070 --> 05:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
um either via mail or by the phone calls
 
05:53:16.110 --> 05:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
in some case yes I mean to try to get a
 
05:53:19.270 --> 05:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
hold of that contact information okay
 
05:53:23.030 --> 05:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay rep representative Sweeny
 
05:53:26.030 --> 05:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry so sure this is more I
 
05:53:27.548 --> 05:53:27.558 align:start position:0%
guess probably a policy question for you
 
05:53:28.868 --> 05:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
but when you're communicating with
 
05:53:31.390 --> 05:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
workers about if they're emailing the
 
05:53:33.750 --> 05:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
department on complaints do you advise
 
05:53:35.868 --> 05:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
them to use a personal email versus a
 
05:53:36.948 --> 05:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
work email
 
05:53:39.230 --> 05:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
or is it that's a that's a great
 
05:53:40.750 --> 05:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
question I I don't believe we give
 
05:53:42.708 --> 05:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
guidance one way or the other um when
 
05:53:44.510 --> 05:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about somebody filing a
 
05:53:45.670 --> 05:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
complaint with the Department we're
 
05:53:47.190 --> 05:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
typically talking about an employee
 
05:53:48.670 --> 05:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
who's filing what we would call a wage
 
05:53:51.150 --> 05:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
and hour complaint they're um notifying
 
05:53:52.430 --> 05:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
the department about a problem or
 
05:53:54.590 --> 05:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
concern with their employer relative to
 
05:53:56.390 --> 05:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
payment of wages or hours worked or
 
05:53:58.310 --> 05:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
things of that nature and and it's
 
05:54:00.070 --> 05:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
whatever email address they want to use
 
05:54:03.190 --> 05:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
with us um I will say I believe most of
 
05:54:05.350 --> 05:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
them are not utilizing their employee
 
05:54:08.270 --> 05:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
addresses um on the workers compensation
 
05:54:11.350 --> 05:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
side complaints don't typically um
 
05:54:13.910 --> 05:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
complaints can come in when Injured
 
05:54:15.750 --> 05:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
Workers are not represented by an
 
05:54:18.150 --> 05:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
attorney they tend to use their
 
05:54:20.628 --> 05:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
individual emails on occasion you will
 
05:54:23.390 --> 05:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
see an uh a work email address from an
 
05:54:25.590 --> 05:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
injured worker right thank you that was
 
05:54:27.910 --> 05:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
just a sure curiosity that I had when
 
05:54:28.990 --> 05:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
you were
 
05:54:31.310 --> 05:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
talking anything
 
05:54:33.788 --> 05:54:33.798 align:start position:0%
else um there's something that somebody
 
05:54:36.510 --> 05:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
this triggered May somebody brought back
 
05:54:38.430 --> 05:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
to me with that we had two years ago
 
05:54:41.110 --> 05:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
called the second injury fund do you
 
05:54:43.628 --> 05:54:43.638 align:start position:0%
remember this yeah sorry do you remember
 
05:54:46.468 --> 05:54:46.478 align:start position:0%
that situation oh I remember vividly
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay so tell me we didn't do anything
 
05:54:50.910 --> 05:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
right or something but we maybe should
 
05:54:53.830 --> 05:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
have I don't know what do you think yes
 
05:54:55.750 --> 05:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh what we had proposed to governor
 
05:55:00.390 --> 05:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
sonunu was that we Sunset um the special
 
05:55:03.628 --> 05:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
fund which is called the um second
 
05:55:09.468 --> 05:55:09.478 align:start position:0%
injury fund it it is um it was an effort
 
05:55:13.830 --> 05:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
to uh ensure that workers who were hired
 
05:55:16.590 --> 05:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh like the friend that you described uh
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
who had previously been injured it's
 
05:55:23.468 --> 05:55:23.478 align:start position:0%
it's um it's a tool to recoup some of
 
05:55:26.150 --> 05:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
the cost if if a person were to have a
 
05:55:30.628 --> 05:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
subsequent injury um the the problem
 
05:55:34.350 --> 05:55:34.360 align:start position:0%
that we see is that in the modern era
 
05:55:36.990 --> 05:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
with the Americans with Disabilities at
 
05:55:40.708 --> 05:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
it it sort of Trumps that that uh
 
05:55:42.868 --> 05:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
function um because you really should
 
05:55:44.510 --> 05:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
not be as an employer you really should
 
05:55:47.468 --> 05:55:47.478 align:start position:0%
not be asking questions about prior
 
05:55:50.628 --> 05:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
injuries in in a hiring decision there's
 
05:55:52.548 --> 05:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
a short window of time when you can do
 
05:55:55.910 --> 05:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
that between hiring and and a start date
 
05:55:58.708 --> 05:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
when you can find out that and then they
 
05:56:00.390 --> 05:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
give would give that information to the
 
05:56:05.030 --> 05:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier who who then can in
 
05:56:07.990 --> 05:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
the event of a subsequent CL subsequent
 
05:56:10.670 --> 05:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
claim can can make a claim against the
 
05:56:12.310 --> 05:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
second injury fund and recuit some of
 
05:56:16.350 --> 05:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
their cost all of the costs are paid
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
back to insurance
 
05:56:21.468 --> 05:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
carriers uh or self-insured injury uh
 
05:56:21.478 --> 05:56:22.788 align:start position:0%
carriers uh or self-insured injury uh
self-insured

05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
self-insured
 
05:56:25.750 --> 05:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
entities and all of the costs of those
 
05:56:27.510 --> 05:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
payments are
 
05:56:31.070 --> 05:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
build through that mechanism that I
 
05:56:34.110 --> 05:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier and it's literally it
 
05:56:36.990 --> 05:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
can be as much as double the size of my
 
05:56:39.868 --> 05:56:39.878 align:start position:0%
operating budget it has been as big as
 
05:56:42.910 --> 05:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
in recent 22 $22
 
05:56:47.430 --> 05:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
million um uh so we proposed to governor
 
05:56:50.670 --> 05:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
sonunu in the last house bill too that
 
05:56:53.510 --> 05:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
um that we Sunset that and stop taking
 
05:56:58.270 --> 05:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
claims um uh during during the house
 
05:57:00.510 --> 05:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
phase it it was removed through
 
05:57:03.910 --> 05:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment from from house bill to so we
 
05:57:06.190 --> 05:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
did not propose it again here
 
05:57:06.200 --> 05:57:07.350 align:start position:0%
did not propose it again here
representative

05:57:07.350 --> 05:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
lean yeah I think we had the former
 
05:57:11.948 --> 05:57:11.958 align:start position:0%
Senate President bragon here that
 
05:57:13.788 --> 05:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
testified against the legislation there
 
05:57:16.708 --> 05:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
was a lot of push back I remember at the
 
05:57:19.190 --> 05:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
time but you still think it's a good
 
05:57:24.150 --> 05:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
idea well it's uh to my mind it is
 
05:57:27.510 --> 05:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
revenue neutral to the industry it's
 
05:57:29.468 --> 05:57:29.478 align:start position:0%
literally one carrier is taking money
 
05:57:32.270 --> 05:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
from another carrier right but it it had
 
05:57:34.270 --> 05:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
an effect on the state budget as I
 
05:57:36.670 --> 05:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
remember right no no effect
 
05:57:39.350 --> 05:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
oh no effect no because I thought we
 
05:57:42.948 --> 05:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
spent or we received or something no for
 
05:57:47.670 --> 05:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
our own employees well yes yes the there
 
05:57:49.510 --> 05:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
there is that possibility yes that the
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
state the state had not traditionally
 
05:57:56.628 --> 05:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
been very good at this function right it
 
05:58:01.190 --> 05:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
was something like Das had to actively
 
05:58:02.830 --> 05:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
pursue these kind of claims and we
 
05:58:04.708 --> 05:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
weren't doing it so therefore we were
 
05:58:06.430 --> 05:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
getting charged more than we were
 
05:58:08.830 --> 05:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
receiving something like that right
 
05:58:12.110 --> 05:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
because this is here yeah that's correct
 
05:58:15.948 --> 05:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
yes yes so maybe if we got rid of it we
 
05:58:17.590 --> 05:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to pursue this this
 
05:58:20.190 --> 05:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic thing right and therefore
 
05:58:23.190 --> 05:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
we we save money yeah and you know my my
 
05:58:25.390 --> 05:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
building it it involves some effort in
 
05:58:27.510 --> 05:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
my building the Attorney General would
 
05:58:29.830 --> 05:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
also tell you that because because they
 
05:58:33.310 --> 05:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
have to defend the fund in the event of
 
05:58:36.190 --> 05:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
denied claims and such they have they
 
05:58:38.510 --> 05:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
have a fair amount of activity uh
 
05:58:40.708 --> 05:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
associated with the second injury fund
 
05:58:42.510 --> 05:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
that they don't they would prefer not to
 
05:58:47.670 --> 05:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
do okay so so Melissa can you kind of re
 
05:58:52.868 --> 05:58:52.878 align:start position:0%
resurrect this idea okay all right very
 
05:58:57.190 --> 05:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
good anybody else no represent leash we
 
05:59:00.350 --> 05:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
still on House Bill to I saw an item
 
05:59:02.548 --> 05:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Sweeny would
 
05:59:05.628 --> 05:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
probably support on page 60 there was a
 
05:59:09.030 --> 05:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
fee it's only $50 for the elevator
 
05:59:10.750 --> 05:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
certificate and I was just curious when
 
05:59:13.750 --> 05:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
that was last increase cuz $50 seems
 
05:59:17.270 --> 05:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
like a awful small amount of money to
 
05:59:18.910 --> 05:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
have someone go out and check an
 
05:59:20.350 --> 05:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
elevator especially if they bring in a
 
05:59:21.640 --> 05:59:21.650 align:start position:0%
ton of of
 
05:59:21.650 --> 05:59:25.670 align:start position:0%
ton of of
[Laughter]

05:59:25.670 --> 05:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:59:28.990 --> 05:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
weight it's uh uh it has not been
 
05:59:30.750 --> 05:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
increased at least as long as I've been
 
05:59:32.510 --> 05:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
at the labor department and probably not
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
for many many years like what 15 years
 
05:59:40.390 --> 05:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
or oh I I would think I would think it's
 
05:59:42.510 --> 05:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
got to be at least at least but I but I
 
05:59:45.708 --> 05:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
don't know you know I eight years here
 
05:59:48.788 --> 05:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
so I can I I have a little elevator
 
05:59:51.628 --> 05:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
story about the State House you know
 
05:59:53.548 --> 05:59:53.558 align:start position:0%
there are two elevators in the state
 
05:59:56.150 --> 05:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
house that appear identical but it turns
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
out they discovered they have completely
 
06:00:03.110 --> 06:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
different mechanisms one has uh a cable
 
06:00:05.708 --> 06:00:05.718 align:start position:0%
that pulls it up and down and the other
 
06:00:06.910 --> 06:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
has a
 
06:00:09.830 --> 06:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
hydraulic that moves it up and down
 
06:00:11.910 --> 06:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
right and so just cuz you know one was
 
06:00:13.830 --> 06:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
done in this era and one was done in
 
06:00:16.150 --> 06:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
that therea it's it's very interesting
 
06:00:17.468 --> 06:00:17.478 align:start position:0%
and if you don't do what you're told
 
06:00:19.220 --> 06:00:19.230 align:start position:0%
they'll cut the cable when
 
06:00:19.230 --> 06:00:21.230 align:start position:0%
they'll cut the cable when
[Laughter]

06:00:21.230 --> 06:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:00:24.670 --> 06:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
you okay anything else no all right well
 
06:00:26.190 --> 06:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming
 
06:00:28.468 --> 06:00:28.478 align:start position:0%
commission absolutely pleasure do we
 
06:00:30.390 --> 06:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
want the
 
06:00:34.270 --> 06:00:34.280 align:start position:0%

50 the $50 elevator yeah well he's
 
06:00:42.190 --> 06:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
getting us all kinds of fee related
 
06:00:42.200 --> 06:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
getting us all kinds of fee related
information

06:00:43.910 --> 06:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:00:47.390 --> 06:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
okay oh well it's in the house bill to
 
06:00:49.510 --> 06:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
right so when we go over the detail yeah
 
06:00:53.430 --> 06:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
yeah because we're we're asking for uh a
 
06:00:55.910 --> 06:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
process change but it could be that at
 
06:01:00.430 --> 06:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
the same time we absolutely sure okay
 
06:01:02.510 --> 06:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
very good thank you how many elevator
 
06:01:06.628 --> 06:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
inspections are there per year uh 5,000

06:01:14.548 --> 06:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
tough
 
06:01:18.070 --> 06:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
well well I don't think they weight test
 
06:01:19.590 --> 06:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think they weight test every
 
06:01:21.868 --> 06:01:21.878 align:start position:0%
time it's not in every not it's for
 
06:01:23.868 --> 06:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
acceptance right and that's only when we
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
