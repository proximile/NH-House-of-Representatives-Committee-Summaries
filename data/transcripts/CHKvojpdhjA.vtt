00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
morning everyone welcome to Edna for the
 
00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
committee next week we will be meeting
 
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday in the finance room for a day
 
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.030 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday in the finance room for a day
of

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
hearings and Wednesday will be here for
 
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
full day of hearings on Thursday there
 
00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
is a session that is not expected to
 
00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
last very long and I'm thinking we might
 
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
want to have an executive session after
 
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
the house session I if so I'll be
 
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
announcing it from the floor but I
 
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to warn you before before doing
 
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.869 align:start position:0%
wanted to warn you before before doing
that

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
so um I'm hoping that we will continue
 
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to not meet on Mondays and
 
00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
Fridays and so uh we in all of February
 
00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
we will probably be meeting Tuesday and
 
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays maybe here maybe somewhere
 
00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
else on Tuesdays and session on
 
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
Thursday and Mondays and Fridays are
 
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
always open for
 
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.789 align:start position:0%
always open for
subcommittees

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
is we are are sharing this room with
 
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
election law and they are planning to be
 
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
here next Tuesday the original agreement
 
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
was that they would have Tuesday and we
 
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
would have the rest of the week and then
 
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
the speaker came in and said but I want
 
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
Thursdays and so we're getting
 
00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
bumped not meeting joint with anybody no
 
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
no no we're just getting a that that
 
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
there well yes but
 
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
we I've planned out our hearings because
 
00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
we've got so many
 
00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.830 align:start position:0%
we've got so many
bills

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm warning you now
 
00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
February we will probably be here every
 
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
Tuesday every Wednesday for hearings and
 
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
that should get all of our all 66
 
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
car it's all right um we got more than
 
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
expected more than uh than I want but
 
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
can

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
so I will encourage people to
 
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
um think about what we could exec next
 
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
Thursday and I'll talk to all the
 
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chairs and see what what
 
00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 align:start position:0%

PR

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 align:start position:0%

morning uh back again so this morning
 
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 align:start position:0%
I'm introducing I'm Mark PR representing
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 15 Manchester award 8 uh I'm
 
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.670 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 15 Manchester award 8 uh I'm
introducing

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
introducing
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
1057 which is uh provisional licensing
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
for emergency
 
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
medical um technicians
 
00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
EMTs uh they added a new law a few years
 
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
back that every Mt once they complete
 
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
their course and they go for lure has to
 
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
go through a background check
 
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's getting a background check
 
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh we've had a couple of people who got
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
out of school wanted to come work for my
 
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
fire department so I I've experienced
 
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
this personally uh and it took them over
 
00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
three months to get their background
 
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
check so here's somebody trying to get
 
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
into a new career to take care of their
 
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
family and they're waiting three months
 
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
obviously they couldn't wait three
 
00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 align:start position:0%
months and they would and found another
 
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
job driving a truck doing whatever and
 
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 align:start position:0%
we lost that person and we're at
 
00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
recruiting Fire EMS and police is very
 
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
hard and difficult now because not a lot
 
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
of people want those jobs so if we have
 
00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 align:start position:0%
somebody interested we need to get them
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
in get them interested and hang on to
 
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
them so what this does is if after three
 
00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
weeks they haven't got their background
 
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
check from from the state the state
 
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
shall issue them a temporary license
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
that they can revoke at any time like if
 
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
their background check comes with
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
something bad
 
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
um you know they can pull that license
 
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
and they can't work anymore and they'll
 
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
just call the employer and notify them
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
that their license has been revoked and
 
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
that person will be gone so you may hear
 
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
that oh background checks don't take
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
that long anymore they're down to two
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
weeks or whatever but what happens if
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety loses a couple of
 
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
people in that department and we're back
 
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
to three months again right so yes I
 
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
know it's working pretty good right now
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
but I'mma kind of like to have safeties
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
that if it extends because even now
 
00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 align:start position:0%
there's a couple that we've had recently
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
that took an extended period of time
 
00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 align:start position:0%
four or five weeks granted that's still
 
00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
not too bad but it
 
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
I hate to see it go back to the three
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
months so this being in place after
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
three weeks if if the state hasn't
 
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
cleared them they get a temporary
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
license and again if something comes
 
00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
back bad they're they're
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
out and with that I'll end my testimony
 
00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
and take questions okay thank you
 
00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.909 align:start position:0%
and take questions okay thank you
representative

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you mam chair good morning
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative morning so I I I totally
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
get your position and in your
 
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
unhappiness with people who are
 
00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
qualified ready to go and system hangs
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
them out to drve uh but what about this
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
the person who whose thing comes back
 
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
bad they've been working
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
potentially damaging people you you know
 
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
that what what I'm getting at so I'll
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
tell you that we work in pairs right so
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
if it's known that they have a temporary
 
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.189 align:start position:0%
if it's known that they have a temporary
license

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
I think we would pair them up with
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
somebody who's a pretty sharp person and
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
and keep an eye on them as
 
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
well especially if they have that
 
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
well especially if they have that
transitional

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
transitional
 
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
license that that's helpful no working
 
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
in pars obviously
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank working in Paris that
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
does mitigate the the potential danger
 
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
of having somebody who's incompetent or
 
00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
correct and any any new EMT we watch
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
like a anyway right because they don't
 
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
have the experience so we're going to be
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
on them to begin
 
00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 align:start position:0%
with not any different because of their
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh temporary thing but because we know
 
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.830 align:start position:0%
uh temporary thing but because we know
they're

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
new yeah and rep representative Schmid
 
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
this applies to people who have
 
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
completed the training and the test
 
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
right so uh and I believe there are a
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
number of other professions that issue
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses pending the result of
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
the criminal background check y right
 
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 align:start position:0%
well I the thing is yes representative
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
schm yes thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh I totally get the the the colic we
 
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
were having the issue is the the the bad
 
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
egg but but the fact of working in pairs
 
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
that mitigates that greatly so thank you
 
00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
for the privilege of uh continuing thank
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative PR do you know how many
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
or what percentage of candidates fail
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
their background
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
check I do not but I don't think there's
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
many I I in recent times for me I've
 
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
only heard of one person coming back
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
with a little something that needed to
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
get dove into more okay thank you
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
because we found out that the licensed
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants 70% of them have it
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
issue for the for the board to review
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
and if that were the case I'd be much
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
more concerned yeah representative if uh
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
La us you had a
 
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you representative
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
sh it thank you madam chair um good
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
morning morning um even though you work
 
00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
in pairs would there ever be an instance
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
where this individual would be alone
 
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
patient so especially a new EMT we would
 
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
not leave them alone right the bus can't
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
the ambulance can't move Mo without two
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
people granted one has to be driving but
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
now in in all of our ambulances we have
 
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240 align:start position:0%
a camera in the back okay right so my
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
rearview mirror becomes the screen for
 
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
the back so I can see what's going on
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's there for a couple reasons mostly
 
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
for safety if if a patient starts to
 
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
attack my partner I can see it pull over
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
and go help and things like that but
 
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
also if any wrongdoing is happening you
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
know I know I always watch that screen
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
you know when I'm driving to check on my
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
but and I would see everything that's
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
going on and you can hear what's going
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
on too okay thank you okay
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh thank you madam
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
chair uh good morning
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
representative um maybe I'm
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding line
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
eight if it's I may not know the
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
language it's supposed to be written in
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
the sentence says a temporary
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
provisional license shall be WR revoked
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
upon the reced of criminal history
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
record check is that a term that says
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's I think if it came back bad it it
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
would be revoked that actually I guess
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
if that check when that check comes back
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
that license is revoked and a permanent
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
regular license would be issued followup
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
please please I understood that yes I
 
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
understand that's what it means but I
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
don't know that's what it says yeah I
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
get you thank you okay representative
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
laus yeah if I maybe I could help um
 
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
it's worded a little oddly but it says
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
that the license shall be revoked upon
 
00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
receipt of a criminal history check if a
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
license denied under this section I took
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
that to mean if the criminal history
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
check resulted in the license being
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
denied then the provisional license
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
would be revoked maybe we worded better
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
but okay okay yes
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative PR we're we like
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
the idea but we're concerned about the
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
word smithing
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
issues that keep popping always it's
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
about the word smithing all right any
 
00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
repr py thank you madam chair just to
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
clarify so once the provisional
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
license I mean rather background check
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
comes back irrespective of when it comes
 
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
between the time it is to how many so
 
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
the provisional license would be just
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
for 3 months the maximum time it would
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
take correct it's going to be until that
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
background check comes back right
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
because you want them to keep working so
 
00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
if I put it at three months and it takes
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
four months for the background check and
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
three months he has to stop working and
 
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
wait for the background check yes that
 
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
that would be specified in the rules
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%

the board of directors for the New
 
00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Ambulance
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
Association uh I I I generally believe
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
we support this bill there have been
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
occasions where particularly during
 
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
covid uh it was a very very lengthy
 
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
process uh and and listen I understand
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
why uh to get lure um but as
 
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative PR uh made mention of uh
 
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult to recruit and
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
retain employees in public safety and
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
Healthcare right now and we want to make
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
sure that every Avenue that is available
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
to us is being explored uh to try and do
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
that um as well we want to make sure
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
that our employees that we hire are um
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
appropriately vetted and that there are
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place for our patients and
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
our and our other staff um and I think
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
that there could be a balance um to be
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
able to do this with this
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank you are there questions
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.040 align:start position:0%

before applying for um those those
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
individuals don't need to be licensed
 
00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:04.519 align:start position:0%
students um so this is someone who's uh
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
um support for the
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
EMTs and um a safe way to guard the
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.710 align:start position:0%
this is um helpful to the
cause

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%

00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
chair I think this
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
is good piece of legislation it still
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
gives a 3-week waiting period giving
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety that ability to
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
complete the background check before the
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
license is issued um we've heard
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
that most of the backup was during covid
 
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
times when we all know there was a lot
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
going on um I think they are getting
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
better at what they are doing with these
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
checks and I'm hoping that you know this
 
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
will not only just speed up the
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
licensing process but um give a little
 
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
bit of time for Department of Safety to
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
complete those checks um and get this
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%

emergency last year just before the

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
this body on consent it went on the
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
speakers behind me to um also speak as
 
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%

me represent so can you tell us a little
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
bit about the changes that were made to

this bill from last years
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the the considerations that which
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
you participated in the study committee
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
I would imagine I I showed up for it and
 
00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
maybe spoke a little more excitedly than
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
I should have um um probably
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative leas would would be able
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
to address that yes please
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
representative L yeah so we worked with
 
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
a number of the stakeholders uh that
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
board and other people and came up with
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
an amendment which passed this Committee
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
in the house and the bill is written
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
here is exactly the bill that is as
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
amended that came out of the
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
house that answers the
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:26.919 align:start position:0%
questions yes it was thank you r
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:40.599 align:start position:0%
fredman Madam chair committee members uh
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
Aubrey Friedman I live in Bridgewater
 
00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:44.839 align:start position:0%
private citizen who doesn't have a pet
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
now but hopes to have one soon again I
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
speak in support of this bill um the
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
thing is I think the licensing is just
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
not necessary the bill already specifies
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
to have a uh a nationally recognized
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
professional Trade Organization and
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's the entity that's going to do the
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
real policing in this industry um and
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
they they have very high standards and
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
they have the real incentive to weed out
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
any bad members so you know reputation
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
that's the main thing you don't want if
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
you certify members who do a poor job or
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
hurt animals or unprofessional unethical
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be that reflects
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
negatively negatively on everybody in
 
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
the industry so they have a real
 
00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
incentive to weed out the bad apples so
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
they're doing the real policing now the
 
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats I have nothing against them
 
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
personally they are well-meaning but
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
they're paperwork people and you know
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a realtor so I have it from the Real
 
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
Estate Commission it's the same thing
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
turn in your paperwork do it
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
thoroughly uh get your cus get it done
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
on time they're very big on on time and
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
pay your fees that's the most important
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
thing they're paperwork people they just
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
um uh if and if they give a license and
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
it actually turns out to be somebody who
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
really does harm the public it's no skin
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
off their nose they wasn't part of their
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
job so you know they're just really not
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
needed and I think there's actually a
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
negative part to having the State
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
Licensing which is it gives a false
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
sense of security to the public that
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
well they the state gave them license so
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know they must be okay no you as a
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
consumer we all know as consumers we
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
have to do our own vetting your number
 
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
one source is word of mouth and
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
reputation when I moved here and got my
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
dog I uh you know I asked my neighbor
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
where do you go for vet services and
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's who I use until I wasn't happy
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
with them then I found somebody else so
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
Word of Mouth reputation your second
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
best source is certification from the uh
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
private you know the Professional
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
Organization ation um long as they're in
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
good standing and you have to do it
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
every 3 years anyway and the third
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
Source we have right now is the
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
licensing and I just don't think they
 
00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
add anything to the process so we should
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
eliminate them save everybody time and
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
money and that's it that's why I support
 
00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.030 align:start position:0%
money and that's it that's why I support
the

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you are there any questions
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
good is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
1233 all right seeing that I will close
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
the public hearing I I do want make a
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
comment though we don't we have no one
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
from oplc to um speak to their agreement
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
this BR laus yeah they were involved in
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee where we came up with
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment and they were okay with it
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
you if we I close the public hearing if
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
we wish to discuss it we should go into
 
00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:10.790 align:start position:0%
we wish to discuss it we should go into
executive

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
session I'm just curious um if this bill
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same as the bill that the
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
Senate killed uh what makes us think
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
it's going to go anywhere represent laus
 
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I spoke with uh
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly you know after the
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
fact unfortunately but yeah her I mean
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
her mother had a massive stroke and she
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
was spending all her time in the
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
hospital and so no one showed up to
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill to Senate Eda and
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
they ited at 5 to Zer by default and
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
then that passed by a Voice vote in the
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
full Senate and um I'm I'm expecting
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
that with somebody explaining the bill
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
to them they might do something
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
different at least I hope so okay
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative gold I was asking you if
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
we were in executive session are you you
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
willing to entertain a motion yes I move
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 128 1233 and
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
I'll second all right do you wish to
 
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you madam
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh I think I may have uh mentioned
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
this last year but I want to share that
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
several years ago I had a very sick
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
rabbit I was losing rabbits a lot of
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
rabbits they were dying and I went to a
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
very expensive exotic um pet vet and he
 
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure out he was pretty sure
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
it was poisoning of some sort he wanted
 
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:31.640 align:start position:0%
to do tests at several hundred dollar
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
per test and you had to test for one
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
chemical at a time my chiropractor who
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
was formerly the state examiner of all
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
chiropractors could not legally treat me
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
do any work for me but he could do me a
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
favor as a friend and so he's passed on
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not uh risking any problems for him
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
he agreed to see my rabbit after hours
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
for no pay and the vet knew it was
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
happening and was very interested in the
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
results and we determined that my
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
rabbits were being poisoned by my garden
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
hoses that were made in China with very
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
toxic chemicals inside that never would
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
have been tested by the vet so I highly
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
support this bill there's a place for
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
all services for our animals and we need
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
to take care of them thank
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
you represent blackis thank you um so
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
right right now as far as I know there
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
aren't veterinarians that are doing
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic for Animals there may be a
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
few I don't know but it is going on
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
there are people doing Chiropractic on
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
animals basically under the table it was
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
and still is maybe a little gray area as
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
to whether they have to be currently
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
they should be licensed as vets or not
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's unclear there I know there are
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
people doing it and they're not
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
advertising because their status is
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
unclear what this would do is um you
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
know at least require that they be uh
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
certified by a nationally recognized
 
00:40:58.109 --> 00:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
certification organization which exists
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
is I was interested to find out and and
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
so you know people will have some
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
assurance that they've had some training
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
and there's some uh review but you know
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
requiring they actually become
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
full-blown vets is excessive for this
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
and the problem is even if vets did this
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I guess trying to get an appointment
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
with a vet can take a very long time and
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's quite expensive so that's my
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
argument that's testimony we got anyway
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
represent man thank you madam chair so
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
this is nationally accredited so it can
 
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
be transferable from one state to
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
another kind of so this is a national
 
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.069 align:start position:0%
another kind of so this is a national
accreditation

00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
accreditation
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
correct laus that's my understanding
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
maybe there's someone here who is more
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
uh knows more about it but but that
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really affect this bill I mean
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
it is a National Organization and the uh
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow oplc under 541a
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
rulemaking to determine the the
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
organization or organizations that would
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
requirement okay any other
 
00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:08.990 align:start position:0%
requirement okay any other
representative

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
Schmid than you madam chair one of the
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
other things we heard last year was that
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
people were having to go to a vet to get
 
00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:20.559 align:start position:0%
a referral to a CH animal chiropractor
 
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
they would have to wait sometimes weeks
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
to get the appointment with the vet just
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
to get a
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
referral so it it's a complete catch22
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
situation that made no sense and the
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
committee recognized that representative
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
Kelly was bringing a simple concept to
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
solve the problem so it sailed through
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
the house and just unfortunate that
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
nobody there but if the Senate if you
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't have somebody to open the bill in
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
the Senate they don't like that I don't
 
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:55.150 align:start position:0%
the Senate they don't like that I don't
blame

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.670 align:start position:0%
 
them

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
represent geart thank you I'm just
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
curious so if the bill goes through and
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's massaging a squirrel without
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
the nationally accredited requirement
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
are they going to be locked up or what
 
00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
is the penalties
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
for that's a very good
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
question I don't believe that
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
this addresses the issue of unauthorized
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
animal Chiropractic it just says that if
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
you are Ally
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
certified um you don't need a Veterinary
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
license um but representative laus I I
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact penalty but I guess
 
00:43:40.549 --> 00:43:40.559 align:start position:0%
what's happened in the past there's when
 
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
it's come to light that people are doing
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
this we heard testimony that some people
 
00:43:44.599 --> 00:43:45.349 align:start position:0%
this we heard testimony that some people
had

00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
gotten what could be called threatening
 
00:43:49.549 --> 00:43:49.559 align:start position:0%
letters from the veterinary board saying
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be doing it and so you
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
know arguably if somebody was doing this
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
without the certification whatever the
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
penalty was for for practicing
 
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
Veterinary uh medicine without a license
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
okay I hope you're not running an
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
authorized animal chiropractic clinic in
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
your backyard represent of Gard that
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
would that would stretch the system
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh maybe I should
 
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
have asked this uh outside of exec
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
session so it it it says on line five uh
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
line four and five the executive
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
director in accordance with rules
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
adopted etc etc in consultation with
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
Board of veterinary medicine and
 
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic examiners which if HB 1676
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
passes uh Board of veterinary medicine
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
will be gone in what year I can't 2025
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
and so it's just a thought that
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line that will have
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
to be corrected or or if that were to
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
pass 1676 were to pass and we decided to
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
make a change to any of the boards
 
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned in it there would be a
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
sweeping revision of all sorts of
 
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.990 align:start position:0%
sweeping revision of all sorts of
statutes

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
reir and let's
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
advance anyone
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro County District 36 to begin
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
this is a simple straightforward Common
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
Sense Bill the purpose of this bill is
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
to streamline the reciprocity licensing
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
process in New Hampshire current statute
 
01:02:09.279 --> 01:02:11.670 align:start position:0%
process in New Hampshire current statute
RSA

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
3310-a license
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
reciprocity authorizes oplc to issue New
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licenses to outof State
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
applicants licensed in another state
 
01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
provided that that the other State's
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements are substantially
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
similar to those in New Hampshire the
 
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
issue that this bill seeks to address is
 
01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
this necessitating that another State's
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements be substantially
 
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
similar to those in New Hampshire
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly places additional
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burdens on both the outof
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
state licensed professional as well as
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
oplc this bill simply eliminates the
 
01:02:58.349 --> 01:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
quote substantially similar unquote
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
language in the current
 
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
statute and this is shown in lines 6
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
through n of the bill text this simple
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
change has a number of benefits first
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
this bill eliminates unnecessary
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
barriers that are needlessly perpetuated
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
by the quote substantially similar
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
unquote language and current statute to
 
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
be clear licensed professionals that
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
have already successfully completed
 
01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
their education obtained the required
 
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
training hours passed a professional
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
licensing exam and satisfied all of the
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
standards and requirements of a of a
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
State Licensing body any additional
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary red T tape makes no sense
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals do not lose their
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
job skills and work rated experience
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
once they cross state lines second this
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
bill Cuts this unnecessary red T tape
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
and it simplifies the process for
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
everyone involved any additional
 
01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
standards and or requirements imposed by
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
the substantially similar language in
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
the current statute undoubtedly creates
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
a burdensome administrative process for
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
both a oplc and the out ofate licensed
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
professionals this costs both time and
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
money by simplifying the current process
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
the verification procedure for oplc is
 
01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
greatly streamlined currently oplc must
 
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
maintain up-to-date information on the
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements of other
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions which can change
 
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
frequently compounding this challenge
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
OPC must also maintain a history of
 
01:04:58.109 --> 01:04:58.119 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements and other dist
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions for the many licensed
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
professions in order to compare the
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
actual requirements that were in place
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
when the outof state applicant earned
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
their occupational license importantly
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
by simplifying the current process
 
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals new to our state
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
can more easily and more quickly obtain
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire license and thus
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
beginning begin to be able to work
 
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
sooner than later in our state providing
 
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
Professional Services third this bill
 
01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
eliminates unnecessary barriers to
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
Interstate Mobility which in turn it
 
01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
benefits workers employers and
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
consumers and this mostly affects women
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
as well as people of color that are
 
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
coming from other states this bill also
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
supports Working Families and and it
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
helps to eliminate New Hampshire's
 
01:05:59.710 --> 01:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
severe labor shortage by expanding our
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
labor force I would say this is a

chair
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
uh here we go thank you for taking my
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
question so philosophically I agree with
 
01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process does this does
 
01:08:26.679 --> 01:08:30.510 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process does this does
this

01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
mean that New
 
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's licensing requirements
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
should be only equivalent to every other
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
states for any license and that we
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't consider making them more
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
restrictive for reasons that our
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
own uh citizens might
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
want thank you for the question
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative so to be clear the
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
purpose of licensing is to establish
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
minimum standards it's it's not to
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
establish unreasonably like high
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
standards which creates
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
barriers for entry for people you know
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
to enter the workforce in New Hampshire
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
and I would also reiterate you know
 
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
carefully consider and contemplate that
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
this bill applies to people licensed
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
professional who hold a
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
current license in good
 
01:09:29.759 --> 01:09:31.510 align:start position:0%
current license in good
standing

01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
standing
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
so that that would be and it makes no it
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
makes no sense to me we all travel out
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
of the state of New Hampshire to other
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
states and you know we engage in I guess
 
01:09:48.159 --> 01:09:48.990 align:start position:0%
states and you know we engage in I guess
you

01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
know I guess Commerce if you will and at
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
times interact with other licensed
 
01:09:57.149 --> 01:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
professionals we we we don't like if we
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
went on vacation to another state we're
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
we're not concerned about the licensing
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
requirements and education of say a
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist to style our
 
01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
hair okay thank
 
01:10:15.159 --> 01:10:19.550 align:start position:0%
hair okay thank
you

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
ba it's not just related to this but in
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
general when somebody
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
licensed in another state comes to work
 
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
here do they announce themselves in some
 
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
way or tell oplc oh by the way I'll be
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
working there thank you for the question
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
representative the the process is is
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
that when somebody from out of state
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's a licensed professional wishes to
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
you know practice provide services in
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire they they
 
01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
need to be licens by the state of New
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so there's an application
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
process which they you know apply apply
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire license and that
 
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
that goes through
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
oplc and with current statute that would
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
oplc Works closely with boards and
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
commissions in order to make that
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
determination under the current
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
law I knew it would be something like
 
01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
representa thank you um representative
 
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
power do you have a list by state as
 
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
compared to New Hampshire for the
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
licenses that are less as stringent than
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
ours and more an
 
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
equivalent um thank you for the question
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative I do not have that list
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
with me here right in on the witness
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
stand um that would be a a daunting task
 
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
there like I said there's number of we
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the jurisdictions
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
which are the 50 states the District of
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
Colombia and the five inhabited
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
territories of the United States so
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
those are the jurisdictions and
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
then you you're you're talking about
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
licensed professions that that would be
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
a huge resar research project I'm sure
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
oplc has that that that information but
 
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
I don't have it printed out right here
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry a followup follow up I hope
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
you don't feel like you're on a witness
 
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
stand because this is not a court okay
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
second of all I'm sure that data is
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
available and if you don't have it I'll
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
ask someone else thank you yes
 
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick uh thank you
 
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh in theory I'm in favor of
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
this concept has there been any thought
 
01:12:28.199 --> 01:12:29.870 align:start position:0%
this concept has there been any thought
to

01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
retrocity in that
 
01:12:36.629 --> 01:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh we will recognize in other states
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
licensing if they recognize
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
ours in other words uh our someone
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
someone from our state moving to moving
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
to another one I thank you for the
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
question representative it I believe and
 
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that there are
 
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
licensed compacts with with other
 
01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.470 align:start position:0%
licensed compacts with with other
states

01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
um I can't really speak in particular to
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
to that I'm sure there are some expert
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
Witnesses behind me that that can answer
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
that question more um
 
01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.470 align:start position:0%
that question more um
completely

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
follow U it's
 
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
just you understand what I was asking in
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
other words we will recognize your
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
State's license people from your state
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
moving into ours if you will recognize
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
people from our State moving in new y
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%

01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
oh I I thank you representative I I
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying but I to
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
me that that that's not a proper
 
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.470 align:start position:0%
me that that that's not a proper
criteria

01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
um well that's my opinion but thank you
 
01:13:43.199 --> 01:13:45.350 align:start position:0%
um well that's my opinion but thank you
yeah

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.669 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
brusa thank you um I was just thinking
 
01:13:54.629 --> 01:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
last year we at put this Statute in
 
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
substantially subst substantially
 
01:13:59.310 --> 01:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
similar because of the questions that we
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
had concerning barriers to entry so what
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
information do you have that leads you
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
now so thank you for the question
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative I appreciate that it's if
 
01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
you when you consider the the concept of
 
01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
of Occupational licensing to reiterate
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
the purposes to establish minimum
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
standards and furthermore we can all
 
01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
agree that we don't want to license um
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know license people that don't have
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
licenses this bill clearly pertains to
 
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
those that
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
hold a professional license from another
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and that goes to the the
 
01:14:50.189 --> 01:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
minimum standard
 
01:14:53.629 --> 01:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
so with regards to to the purpose of
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
Licensing and what I can say is
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
that there are 40% 40% of the states
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
have moved to some form of universal
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
licensing the you know the first state
 
01:15:15.149 --> 01:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
2024 there are 20 of the 50 states that
 
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
have moved to to Universal licensing
 
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't a good thing then we would
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
not see that that shift it streamlines
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
the process it streamline lines the
 
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
process for licensing and and it helps
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
the professionals did that answer the
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
question actually no but we'll try it
 
01:15:41.639 --> 01:15:42.950 align:start position:0%
question actually no but we'll try it
again

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
the the next speaker will be executive
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
director courn who will be describing
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
how we implemented the substantially
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
similar requirement because I think that
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
will answer some questions both from the
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee and from other people in the
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
audience okay representative Brown and
 
01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.950 align:start position:0%
audience okay representative Brown and
then

01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:05.960 align:start position:0%

Shu thank you madam chair um I'm a
 
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
little uncomfortable with the language
 
01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.750 align:start position:0%
little uncomfortable with the language
another

01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction you're saying that's other
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
US states and territories but that
 
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually limit U could be
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
be thank you for the question
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative I am H I was having a
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of trouble hearing you but if
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
I understood the
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
question your concern is with regards to
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
the to the term jurisdictions so I've
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
been in front of this committee um four
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
times previously with occupational
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
licensing reform bills and in fact one
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
of my
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
bills that it focused specifically on
 
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
cosmetology a Aesthetics and barbering
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
out ofate lure and it was exactly the
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
same as this bill in front of you but it
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
just focused on that one profession and
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
as in the hearing I did get feedback
 
01:17:11.679 --> 01:17:12.629 align:start position:0%
as in the hearing I did get feedback
from

01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
oplc um with regards to the the use of
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
that word jurisdiction so I I feel very
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable including that in this
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%

have a question he brought it up um if
 
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
you have a driver's license from Vermont
 
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
and you move to New Hampshire you have
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
to get a new driver's
 
01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
license it do will this bill cover
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
something like that no driver's licenses
 
01:17:55.229 --> 01:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
are not considered professional licenses
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
okay I also have another question if
 
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
that's okay uh I moved from Missouri to
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a few years ago I had a
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
real estate license in uh Missouri a
 
01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
broker's license I could not or I I
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
would have had to take classes again in
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
order to get a New Hampshire one same
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
thing with a teaching
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
certificate um I had to take classes
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
will this cover that Gap thank you for
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
the question representative as I stated
 
01:18:27.149 --> 01:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
in my bill introduction I do acknowledge
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
that there are some licensed professions
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
that we need perhaps to consider more
 
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
and real
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
estate was was one of them so I would be
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
um willing to work with whomever
 
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
oplc um Etc to to address that if if
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
needed and um work on an amendment yes
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you may not have
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
been aware but New Hampshire has some
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
really bizarre land ownership laws and
 
01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
the deeds and anyone coming in as a real
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
estate lensey would need to get training
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
and pass a test on New Hampshire
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
specific laws but other than that your
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
your your license is good for the
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
general knowledge but not the New
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge man py thank you madam chair
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for U taking my
 
01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:31.719 align:start position:0%
question do you have any idea how many
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
licensing Fields this is going to have
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
an effect licensed professionals that
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
will this bill would change thank you
 
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
representative that that's a very good
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
um to be clear this bill would only
 
01:19:52.239 --> 01:19:54.709 align:start position:0%
um to be clear this bill would only
affect

01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
affect
 
01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
professions that are Li that are
 
01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
licensed for so for example if there's a
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
profession that's a person that's coming
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
from another state and they don't have a
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
license but New Hampshire licenses that
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
profession this bill would not apply to
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
them and they would not be able to
 
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
obtain a New Hampshire license because
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
they didn't hold a current active valid
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
license from out of state and I
 
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned that rep that director
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
Courtney would be the best person to
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
answer the numbers questions because
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
she's got that data uh Madam chair yes
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate this going to
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and if so I was going to
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
say that the exceptions could maybe be
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
brought up and worked out there that it
 
01:20:41.709 --> 01:20:41.719 align:start position:0%
is in fact going to go to subcommittee
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
surprise it is your
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so uh yes and I think
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
specific exemptions would be best
 
01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
covered in in subcommittee all right
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any other questions
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative gold I have a follow-up
 
01:20:59.709 --> 01:20:59.719 align:start position:0%
question on uh International licensing
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
but is that best left for um I think so
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%

offer a few comments and I'm of course
 
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any of your questions uh
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
regarding what we're doing now or
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
regarding how we would implement this
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
bill as proposed
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
so I think um I think it's important to
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
understand that the whole concept
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
regarding portability or an endorsement
 
01:22:01.629 --> 01:22:01.639 align:start position:0%
is based on an understanding that uh
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
you're comparing Apples to
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
Apples um and when we start talking
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
about um removing requirement that we do
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
that comparison you could get into a
 
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
situation where you're comparing apples
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
to oranges in the sense that um the
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
license that is coming or the person
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
with the license coming from another
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
state doesn't actually
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
have uh the same license because they
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
didn't undertake the same education
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
training and experience and I think
 
01:22:31.709 --> 01:22:31.719 align:start position:0%
you've recognized or representative
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
power has recognized that there are
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
several notable exceptions to this
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
naturopath being one of them in our
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
state you need a doctorate level degree
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
you're authorized to prescribe
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
controlled drugs in other states you
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
need a two-e webinar and so under this
 
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
proposed language somebody with a two-e
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
webinar could come in in get licensed
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
and prescribe control drugs that's
 
01:22:53.629 --> 01:22:53.639 align:start position:0%
really not consistent with the concept
 
01:22:53.639 --> 01:22:54.510 align:start position:0%
really not consistent with the concept
of

01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
portability the other issue that I think
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
is less obvious um relates to the fact
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
that many states license the same
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
professions but call them different
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
things we see that in the context of the
 
01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
mental health field in particular um
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
they're very much in favor of the
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
acronyms and I struggle to keep up with
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
the different
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
acronyms um but essentially you know for
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
example in the field of alcohol and drug
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
use counseling um
 
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
many states refer to what our license
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
type is as a licensed alcohol and drug
 
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
use counselor as something completely
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
different and you're not going to know
 
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not that person coming in um
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
should be licensed under this language
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
unless you do the comparison you're
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
going to have to do the comparison in
 
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
certain in certain Fields so I we fully
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
support uh portability um absolutely and
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
I would say that the legislative
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives that um were spearheaded and
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
supported by Governor snoooo last
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
session um regarding HP 594 in
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
particular um we are we have made great
 
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
inroads in terms in terms of
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process uh for those
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
professions that we've implemented um
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
RSA 310 colon 17 for um we're down to 24
 
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
business you know 24 hours or less in
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
terms of issuing a license it's pretty
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
streamlined um but I would just say that
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
I think that the you know the committee
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
should probably consider the purpose of
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
portability it does it will always
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
require some sort of analysis um and
 
01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
some sort of comparison between other
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
states with that I'd be happy to answer
 
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
any questions okay representative leus
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
and then man py thank you um so I guess
 
01:24:49.109 --> 01:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
the the question is you said there
 
01:24:50.109 --> 01:24:50.119 align:start position:0%
there's going to have to be some
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
comparison so the the question is is um
 
01:24:57.109 --> 01:24:57.119 align:start position:0%
in or you know to do as much in the way
 
01:24:59.229 --> 01:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
of reciprocity as possible but to deal
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
with the situations you
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
raised um are there changes to stat
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
current statute that would would help
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
that along but still allow the
 
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
comparisons that you feel are
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
necessary I think the legislature really
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
struck the right balance last session
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
because if you recall that the um with a
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
substantially similar language because
 
01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
if you look in 332g which is the
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
predecessor to RSA
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
33017 it spoke of substantial
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
equivalency and the challenge with that
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
is it was frequently interpreted as
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
actual equivalency um to the point where
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
people who are coming from other states
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh that didn't require you know that you
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
know a photo to be submitted with the
 
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
application were getting denied I mean
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
that's just totally absurd um so by
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
changing the language to substantially
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
similar um I think that that really did
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
strike the right balance because it it
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
contemplates that the core
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
requirements um have to be satisfied and
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
if you look at the interim rules that
 
01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
the office has adopted as well as the
 
01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
rules that we just filed you will see
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
that it we are comparing Apples to
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
Apples but we are allowing folks to come
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
in from other jurisdictions that have
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
different requirements but that are
 
01:26:19.709 --> 01:26:19.719 align:start position:0%
similar that we feel are meeting um both
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
the education and experience that is
 
01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:23.109 align:start position:0%
the education and experience that is
necess

01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
necess
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
um in order to be minimally competent in
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
our state and the other thing to
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
understand too is that every state has
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know their own authority regarding
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
scope of practice so it could be that
 
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
you know as I brought up with
 
01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
naturopaths the webinar is perfectly
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
fine for whatever naturopaths do in that
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
particular State because they have a
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
different scope of practice and so when
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
we're looking at competency we're
 
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
looking at competency for our scope of
 
01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
practice and modifying scope of practice
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
in the future to address minimum
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
competency could have a different impact
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
on Workforce and and and access to care
 
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
so to answer your short question or your
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
question I think that really last year
 
01:27:06.189 --> 01:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
we struck the right
 
01:27:08.669 --> 01:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
balance um with a substantially similar
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
language all right thank you represent
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
man py thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question how many licensed
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
Fields would this
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
affect depending
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
on how sweeping it can be sure we have
 
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
over 200 license types um that's not
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
including temporary license types when
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
you factor those in I mean there's
 
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more um but over 200
 
01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:38.109 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more um but over 200
license

01:27:38.109 --> 01:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:27:43.149 --> 01:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
types followup thank you and this also
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
impacts the public safety service to our
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters correct all
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
licensing certainly because the purpose
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
of Licensing is to protect the public so
 
01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
you need to ensure as representative
 
01:27:57.870 --> 01:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
power mentioned that you're establishing
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
minimum qualifications it's not to
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
promote the professionals to protect the
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
public through minimum qualifications
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
Goldie thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.189 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
question

01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
so the language we worked out last year
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
in here is working currently the way
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
you're doing things if we went to
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
try and change the language like that is
 
01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:29.119 align:start position:0%
here we would have to start going
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
through individual licensing to see who
 
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
would fit better to compare the Apples
 
01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
to Apples and the versus apples to
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
oranges whereas if we leave a
 
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
standardized language for all licensing
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
would make it much easier on you making
 
01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:46.990 align:start position:0%
would make it much easier on you making
sure

01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
considerably the same when they're
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
coming from State to state for a licing
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
here in
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah so I'll give you an
 
01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:00.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah so I'll give you an
example

01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
um there are in barbering for example a
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
lot of States actually New Hampshire is
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
ahead of the game right because we've
 
01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
split up the lure requirements so we
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
have both a barber and a master Barber
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
requirement I think our
 
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
Barbers I don't want to misspeak but
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's somewhere in the 750 hours
 
01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
range is what it's required and then we
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
have a master Barber course so a lot of
 
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
states only have one one barber license
 
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
but they actually have the requirement
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
their Education and Training is at our
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
Master Barber level so under this as
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
proposed certainly I could issue them a
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
barber license but that's not what they
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
were trained to do but I'm not going to
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
know that until I open up that states uh
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
statutes and rules to understand that
 
01:29:50.189 --> 01:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
they were actually trained to be a
 
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
master Barber and we should be issuing
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
doing the master barber license so I
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
think either under this language or the
 
01:29:58.109 --> 01:29:58.119 align:start position:0%
other language in order to really do you
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
know do the lcy Justice you have to look
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
at what the requirements are I don't
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
know if that answers your question
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
followup it does and so I I'm just
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
trying to get to that the language we
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
use currently for all licensing with
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
is more beneficial for encompassing all
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
licensing versus trying to figure out
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
where we should remove it from
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
yes and the other thing that I would say
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
is the current statute requires us to
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
consult with the
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
boards and well I don't think that you
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
know always has to be a statutory
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
requirement for my own practice I'm
 
01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
obviously not always going to be here I
 
01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
think there's a benefit to having that
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
in statute and I'll bring up an example
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
um marriage and family therapists if you
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
just look at um so in our state they are
 
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
required to have 3,000 hours of
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
postgraduate experience experience in
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
their rules they have to have a th hours
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
of direct client contact so if you just
 
01:30:59.310 --> 01:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
look at our
 
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
statute um and we you do an analysis
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
you're like okay well the statute only
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
speaks to um experience the postgraduate
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
experience it doesn't speak to the type
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
of experience so um if you just look at
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
our statute you may say that you know
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
maybe like two 2500 is sufficiently um
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
comparable but the problem is a lot of
 
01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
states don't impose postgraduate
 
01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
experience they impose requirements only
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
for direct patient
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
contact and I found that working with
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
the board was really helpful to
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
understand you know how many hours of
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
direct patient contact are equal to um
 
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
total experience because if we didn't
 
01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
have if I didn't have that expertise I
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
would we would have excluded like 30
 
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
States um which is something we don't
 
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
want to do um and so I think having that
 
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
requirement in statute is also really
 
01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
helpful and it Fosters that
 
01:31:55.870 --> 01:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
collaborative working
 
01:31:58.109 --> 01:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
relationship thank you repr gold and
 
01:31:58.119 --> 01:31:58.830 align:start position:0%
relationship thank you repr gold and
then

01:31:58.830 --> 01:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
lus thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
question and I know this is going to
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and we can discuss things
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
in more detail then but my question is
 
01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
is there currently any path for you your
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
office and the boards to look at
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
International rep I'm not going to be
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
able to say that word rep Pro yeah yes
 
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that word Yes actually in the
 
01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
rules that we just filed um we have a
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on March 7th uh hopefully we'll
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
make it in time for the April jail card
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
date but in the rules we just filed we
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
contemplate a scenario for um
 
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
International or foreign trained um
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
lenses and what we've proposed is that
 
01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
they are required to go to a recognized
 
01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:52.119 align:start position:0%
third party to have their credential and
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
their education evaluated it's a process
 
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
that we already use in other license
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
types Physical Therapy Board of Medicine
 
01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:01.400 align:start position:0%
and essentially that third party says
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
yes this is what they got in Sweden this
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
is what is required in Sweden this you
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
know and this is how this compares to
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
our requirements and then we would be
 
01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
able to do the analysis of whether or
 
01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
not um you know that jurisic
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction has sufficiently similar
 
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
requirements um so we are proposing that
 
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
you know obviously that's in the initial
 
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
draft I don't know what what will happen
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
but follow so if that passes as I read
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
through this I didn't see anything that
 
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
that defined the other jurisdictions as
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
having to be cont the United States
 
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
would that also make this apply to
 
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
International rules as you develop them
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's open to interpretation as
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
to what the term jurisdiction
 
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
means um and we've taken the position in
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
our our filing our rules filing that
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction is anywhere it's not
 
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
limited to a US jurisdiction I don't
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
know that that was the intent um that's
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
what we've just the plain language
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction represent leus and then
 
01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
groer thank you um yeah I understand
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
your concern about just uh plane
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
removing the substantially similar
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
because you might need to do some
 
01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:22.590 align:start position:0%
because you might need to do some
analysis

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
um but my concern and the reason I I'm
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
interested in this is that and maybe you
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
can help me with this is that
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
substantially similar to me is a very
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
kind of vague not well- defined term and
 
01:34:37.709 --> 01:34:37.719 align:start position:0%
while I might think that your views on
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
it currently might be reasonable you
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
know as you said you're not going to be
 
01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
there in the future so is there anything
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
that puts boundaries or real meaning on
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
what substantially similar means and
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
would provide you know guidance or
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
boundaries to how someone else might
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
interpret it in the
 
01:34:56.430 --> 01:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
future on the actual phrase
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
substantially similar no um I would say
 
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
that our rules have addressed what we
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
think is substantially
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
similar what what um you know if you
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
look at some of the audit report from
 
01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
clear the Council of leg uh Council on
 
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
licensing enforcement and regulation you
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
know they've always suggested like the
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
70% Mark which is what I say to boards
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
um you know look at the 70% Mark the
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
other thing that um we're looking at and
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
some boards have um wanted to
 
01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
incorporate is okay so let's say the
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
state has an a requirement of a th000
 
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
hours we have 2,000 but this person has
 
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
been practicing for 30 years I mean is
 
01:35:43.149 --> 01:35:43.159 align:start position:0%
there a mechanism for us to say that
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
experience should count toward that
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
requirement we've interpreted the
 
01:35:51.149 --> 01:35:51.159 align:start position:0%
statute as allowing for that I'm not
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
sure sure that it's explicit so if
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
you're considering a statutory change
 
01:35:59.470 --> 01:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
that might be something um to take into
 
01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
consideration followup follow up um yeah
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
I mean that's a concern I've had with
 
01:36:07.229 --> 01:36:07.239 align:start position:0%
substantially simar all along and you
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
know if you have some language that
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
might replace substantially similar
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
rather than completely removing it but
 
01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
might you think allow you to do a better
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
job um not right now necessarily but
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
being interest in SE it thank you yes
 
01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.270 align:start position:0%
being interest in SE it thank you yes
representative

01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
gr so last year we dealt with this issue
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
because we felt that there was
 
01:36:33.199 --> 01:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
because we felt that there was
some

01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
unmeasurable uh conditions to lenser
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
such as essay exams essay we remove
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
those so we have tried to which should
 
01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
help with the definition of
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
substantially similar can you comment on
 
01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:49.750 align:start position:0%
substantially similar can you comment on
that

01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
please yes so most boards had an
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
endorsement process um but I would say
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
it was not true endorsement so I'll give
 
01:37:01.629 --> 01:37:01.639 align:start position:0%
you an example um one of our license
 
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
types um in order to you know to get a
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
license initially you have to do an exam
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
you have to have a supervisor you have
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
to have an internship you have to have
 
01:37:13.629 --> 01:37:13.639 align:start position:0%
somebody sign off so the endorsement
 
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
process was you have to do all of that
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
and show us proof that you are licensed
 
01:37:21.629 --> 01:37:21.639 align:start position:0%
in another state so that's not true
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
endorsement endorsement is show us you
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
have a license in another state and we
 
01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
issue a license so 594 really addressed
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
that issue it got rid of those types of
 
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
processes where somebody has to do
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
everything plus um show that you know
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
that they're licensed in another state
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
and I think it's been very successful um
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
for the license types that we've
 
01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
implemented on day one um of
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
implementation of our interim rules we
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
were able to issue 70 physician licenses
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
who had just been hanging out forever
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
because they were waiting on letters of
 
01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:01.719 align:start position:0%
reference um and you know that to me is
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
is silly um but in any event I it was
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
very I mean it's been very effective you
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
don't need letters of reference anymore
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
we just need to know that you're licens
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
and good standing in another
 
01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
state okay B
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
garard thank you madam
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
chair so this addresses an issue that
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
was raised brought to my attention by a
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
tattoo shop owner and I just want to
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
know if this would help fix the
 
01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.149 align:start position:0%
know if this would help fix the
situation

01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
where unlike other licenses where
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's a standard test um RSA 314 A3
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
the apprenticeship for tattooist last
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
sentence A person shall remain an
 
01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
apprentice for at least one year and
 
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
until the supervising ly attests that
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
The Apprentice is qualified to become
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
licensed yeah so it's my understanding
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
that there are certain tattooists that
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
are basically holding the apprentice's
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
license Ransom until until a certain sum
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
is paid would this help alleviate that
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
bill I don't know more than anything
 
01:39:01.589 --> 01:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
else that I'm aware of that issue there
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
is a problem with with the um statute
 
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
generally I think um and we have taken
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions when it has come to
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
our attention regarding that um I would
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
say that body art was included in the
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
interm rules specifically because we
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
require an apprentice ship of a c in New
 
01:39:24.669 --> 01:39:24.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even if you're licensed in
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
another state which is crazy um and so
 
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
we were able to address the overall
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
issue of portability through with body
 
01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
art through the
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
594 um many states do not license party
 
01:39:40.510 --> 01:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
artists at the personal level they only
 
01:39:43.589 --> 01:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
um license the establishments and it's
 
01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
actually done through local uh
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
Departments of Public Health and so
 
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
that's another issue comparing apples to
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
oranges you know you want to make sure
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
you're looking at those requirements um
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
but I would say that that that's a
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
separate Enforcement issue of somebody
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
basically um utilizing their position of
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
authority to um you know outside of what
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing thank you
 
01:40:09.679 --> 01:40:11.550 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing thank you
representative

01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you madam chair uh thanks
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so if if I
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
interpret this
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
correctly if a person comes from a state
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
that has a lesser requir reement for a
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
license and and this passes they can
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
come here those that here are here in
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
the state still have a greater
 
01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
requirement to get that same license yes
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
I would say the distinction is not
 
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily where they reside it's where
 
01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
they're initially licensed so if they
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't have a license and they're going
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
through the yes correct okay and
 
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
followup if I might
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
and based on what I heard last week in
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
testimony there would it be your opinion
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
that there will be push back from those
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
that already have licenses on this Phil
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative Brown the people here to
 
01:40:59.790 --> 01:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill are example of such
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
you yes uh I have a simpler question
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
sure I know you have interim rules on
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
defining what is substantially similar
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
how many Prof for how many professions
 
01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
have you issued those
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
rules I believe it's 13 I want to go
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
back and count but I believe it's 13 and
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
what we did is we prioritized the ones
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
that we thought would have the greatest
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
impact um that's why I picked body art
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know most people are like they don't
 
01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:32.679 align:start position:0%
have a a a portability issue they they
 
01:41:36.589 --> 01:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely do um and uh you know summon
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
healthare we also prioritized
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
electricians um and it pretty much lined
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
up with what their portability was
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
previously but we streamlined the
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
process okay thank you any other
 
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you thank you
 
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
time all
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
right the uh
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:18.189 --> 01:42:18.199 align:start position:0%

committee we do appreciate the sponsor
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
statement relative to real estate
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
licensing though we oppose um the bill
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
as written this is a consumer protection
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
issue we currently have a low barrier to
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
entry in the existing recognition
 
01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
process where we Rec recognize that a
 
01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
real estate professional in a different
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
state has gone through the basic
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
education and the national portion um to
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
prove that they um have that basic
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge what we're asking for in the
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
res recognition process is that they
 
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
share their knowledge of or get tested
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
on their knowledge of New Hampshire
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
specific laws so that looks like a 40
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
question exam where no education is
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
required they just have to know the
 
01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.430 align:start position:0%
required they just have to know the
information

01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
um a background check and a licensing
 
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
fee our neb neighboring states utilize
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
the same process because it just makes
 
01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
sense um once you cross borders
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
Everything Changes um in regards to
 
01:43:38.109 --> 01:43:38.119 align:start position:0%

01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%

01:43:49.229 --> 01:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
of submitting an offer and accepting an
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
offer can be very different across
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
borders I am licensed in both New
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Vermont and previously
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
licensed in Massachusetts and
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and I am thankful that I had
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
to go through this recognition process
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
and take that basic knowledge um exam to
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
share that I knew what I was doing when
 
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:17.719 align:start position:0%
borders um as a licensed real estate
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
educator I can attest to relative to the
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
barrier to entry for
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
recognition our process is incredibly
 
01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
fast in New Hampshire um the application
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
and the testing process is fast and it's
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
also it's often months faster than our
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
neighboring states um as As Told to me
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
by our students that are testing in
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
those areas okay so to summarize our
 
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill this bill
 
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
provides benefit to prospective outof
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
State agents only it does not benefit
 
01:44:54.189 --> 01:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
the consumer by requiring even the basic
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
knowledge of New Hampshire's rules and
 
01:44:59.550 --> 01:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
regulations resulting in great legal and
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
financial exposure to those consumers
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
our current recognition process is
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
working it's efficient and effective and
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
as director Courtney has stated in
 
01:45:11.229 --> 01:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
previous testimony on previous bills
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
that we have opposed um that New
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not substantially similar
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
to any of our neighboring states I'm
 
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
happy to take it any questions thank you
 
01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.149 align:start position:0%
happy to take it any questions thank you

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
heard it's going to a subcommittee will

Court

01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair my name is
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
Steven rord I'm a licensed electrician
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
here to testify on behalf of House Bill
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
127 too we're passing around a handout
 
01:46:24.239 --> 01:46:25.149 align:start position:0%
127 too we're passing around a handout
but

01:46:25.149 --> 01:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:46:28.030 --> 01:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
um we want to state that begin with we
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
we welcome reciprocity we actually have
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
reciprocity at over 21 states or
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere around that number right now
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
we've reached out long before this even
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
became an issue so we're all for trying
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
to get reciprocity but we think it
 
01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
should be fair and balanced in order to
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
do it we oppose the bill as written and
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
um I can start as they passing that
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
around just we spent a lot of time in
 
01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years with with OP
 
01:46:54.189 --> 01:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
oplc bills um coming in and trying to
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're changing the laws
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
and fixing the rules so that everything
 
01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
is objective and not
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
subjective and by taking this out you
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
kind of leave the entire bill as
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
subjective to the OPC and the executive
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
director at the time so objectivity is
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
something that we feel is important if
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
if we're going to continue to do that
 
01:47:17.709 --> 01:47:17.719 align:start position:0%
through everything else in the rules and
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
oplc and all the other requirements why
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
aren't doing it
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
here um as far as our concerns the
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
executive director concerns not
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
specifically with one that we have now
 
01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
but just in general that because this
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
position is an appointed position and
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
can be it will change over
 
01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
time that person may have different
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
views and decide what similar
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent is we don't
 
01:47:41.310 --> 01:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
really want to have that roller coaster
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think back and forth to that we
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
we we should really work on trying to
 
01:47:46.589 --> 01:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
just clarify substantially equivalent I
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
think the institutional knowledge as the
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
Director spoke is is with the boards is
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
huge some of these boards and people in
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
these boards have been around for years
 
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
and experienced a lot and that's
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
important for Public Safety as well in
 
01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
the state which is why these boards were
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
originally formed way back for Public
 
01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
Safety so we don't want to lose that and
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
that was the last SEC um comment as far
 
01:48:12.189 --> 01:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
as the concern not losing that for
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent um I think
 
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
that what would probably be best and I
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
apologize there taking a lot of notes as
 
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
testimony so they um is finding I think
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
what fix it all to be honest with you
 
01:48:27.790 --> 01:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
just finding a minimum stand up is
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent and it really
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
isn't that hard to
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
Define okay you pick a percentage
 
01:48:35.589 --> 01:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
whatever that percentage is of whatever
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
your particular laws are right now and
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
you say Okay substantially equivalent
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
let's just say is
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
90% or if you don't have all the
 
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
paperwork and all the information if you
 
01:48:47.709 --> 01:48:47.719 align:start position:0%
you know you can't produce your
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
schooling paperwork and and things like
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
that I've been doing this for 30 plus
 
01:48:55.229 --> 01:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
years and uh not to give away a old but
 
01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
I couldn't find my school paperwork
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
probably if somebody asked me to to
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
prove that so you pick a standard you
 
01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
pick a percentage and then you adjust
 
01:49:06.589 --> 01:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
that percentage based on OJT experience
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
how long they've been licensed now
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
defining those needs to be worked out
 
01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
whether you say you know after five
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
years you only need 70% or after 10
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
years you need 60% because again that
 
01:49:20.350 --> 01:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
work experience means something so you
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
could Define that fairly simply with
 
01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
something to that effect something like
 
01:49:26.910 --> 01:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
that um the other thing too is you could
 
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
solve this very easily by simply saying
 
01:49:31.149 --> 01:49:31.159 align:start position:0%
after a minimum amount of time license
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
you can take a test and if you pass you
 
01:49:36.189 --> 01:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
get it it eliminates all of this why do
 
01:49:38.189 --> 01:49:38.199 align:start position:0%
we all had to pass a test to to get
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
licens in the state so it's a simple way
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
to fix it we have to go to another state
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have to test if they're not
 
01:49:47.470 --> 01:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
reciprocating with us so you don't have
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
to worry about who determines
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
substantially equipment if they pass the
 
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
test right and say they've been licensed
 
01:49:55.709 --> 01:49:55.719 align:start position:0%
for 2 to 5 years something like that so
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
there's many um you know this represents
 
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
over 54 to 60 boards I know it's changed
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
over time over 177,000 licenses this is
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
a huge impact and and I think it's
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
important that we try to find the right
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
fix for it and I think that keeping an
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
objective and defining substantially
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
equivalent is really what is going to
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
have the biggest impact thank you are
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
there questions representative lais
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're getting at and
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
and you know it's having people take the
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
test if they're moving from one state to
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
the other may seem reasonable but if
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable for them if they've been
 
01:50:31.149 --> 01:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
pract you know if they've been
 
01:50:32.589 --> 01:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
practicing for 20 years and they have to
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
take the test to get the license here I
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
mean is it also reasonable to say that
 
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
people who are currently licensed need
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
to take the test again every 10 years or
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
whatever to maintain license I mean
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
would you support that as well well the
 
01:50:48.189 --> 01:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
difference is they went through the most
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
of them probably obviously depends how
 
01:50:50.669 --> 01:50:50.679 align:start position:0%
long they've been license went through
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
the requirements here in the state to
 
01:50:54.589 --> 01:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
get it whereas we don't really know out
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
of state you know take an instance I
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
think Colorado has half the amount of
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
hours schooling wise that we have so I
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
mean that's important I mean you you'd
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
want to know that so I'm just offering
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
the licensing part as an option not just
 
01:51:07.229 --> 01:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
the only one like that could be an
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
option all right thank you
 
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%

mechanical
 
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
licensing do you mind if Mr trumbley
 
01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:22.430 align:start position:0%
licensing do you mind if Mr trumbley
joins

01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
joins
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%

01:51:44.669 --> 01:51:44.679 align:start position:0%
luck since these boards are uh
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
professions are intertwined I they
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%

representing the gas uh Fitts
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
Association and we're opposed to this
 
01:52:17.310 --> 01:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
language and this uh in the bill um one
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
of the things that kind of want to bring
 
01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:20.470 align:start position:0%
of the things that kind of want to bring
out

01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
with the trades the education is
 
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
different from state to state and some
 
01:52:28.109 --> 01:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
of the other professional licenses maybe
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
in the uh the nursing and dental you
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
know they're going to college there's
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
some standards in there throughout the
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
national and plumbing um and gas fitting
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
um there is no real National Standard on
 
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
the training and on the education the
 
01:52:46.589 --> 01:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
states and sometimes the the the the
 
01:52:48.990 --> 01:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
cities get the pick to choose what
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to how they're going to
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
train their their
 
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
technicians um in New Hampshire our gas
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
license is kind of unique that is
 
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
something that a lot of uh States and
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
counties do not have a separate gas
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
license uh per se some they um sometimes
 
01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
their Plumbing license will cover their
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
gas license and in a lot of states there
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
is no such thing is licensing there is
 
01:53:17.069 --> 01:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
no Plumbing license there is no gas
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
license um New York there is no State pl
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
plumbing license there's City licenses
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that um so there's a lot
 
01:53:28.109 --> 01:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
of states that there is no license and I
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
understand that this bill says it has to
 
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
have the license I uh I wasn't as uh as
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
thorough as as Mr anot was I didn't have
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
copies for everybody but just kind of
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
give you an example I handed out uh
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
minutes from the main plumbing board um
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
that I applied for my main Plumbing
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
license now I've been licensed in the
 
01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:51.719 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire since
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
1985 as an apprentice I had my master
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
plumbing license by 1990 I've installed
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
thousands of uh uh Plumbing in houses
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
and gas furnaces I've been in the
 
01:54:08.109 --> 01:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
business for a ton of years okay and um
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
done been on many code boards and
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
everything else like that and I was
 
01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
denied my main Plumbing license because
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
their code is different from our code so
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
they have in their language similar
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
equivalent and they did not they did not
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
believe that New Hampshire laws and New
 
01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire training was similar
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
equivalent to their training in laws
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
over here in New Hampshire we go to
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
school as a plumber for four years Maine
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's two years Massachusetts it's five
 
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
years Vermont it's four years it's all
 
01:54:51.550 --> 01:54:51.560 align:start position:0%
over the place okay so um Maine uses a
 
01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
different code than New Hampshire
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uses a different code than
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire theart is on the same code
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
that we are they might be on a different
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
year but they're on the same code so
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
right now the way it's working is um if
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
you have a uh license or I should say
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
the way it was working if you have a
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
license they're testing so you come in
 
01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
you have a journeyman's license from
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they take a test that's in
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
with the codes of uh New Hampshire and
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
also it covers the laws of New Hampshire
 
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
also if I go to new to uh Massachusetts
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
I have to do the same thing I have to
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
take a test and obviously now you can
 
01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
see if I go to if I want my main license
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
I will have to take a main test in order
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
to pass their test even though I went to
 
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
a four-year Apprentice program and there
 
01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
is a 2-year Apprentice program okay so
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
what could happen especially on the
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
plumbing side um you you know people
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire will go to could go
 
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
to Maine get their license in 2 years
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
and then if you don't have that testing
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
equipment testing um um scenario they
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
can come to New Hampshire and get their
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
license in two years where maybe
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
somebody that lives on the west uh side
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
or north um New Hampshire is not going
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
to travel all the way over to Maine to
 
01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
get their license in two years so right
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
now the way it's working for the
 
01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
plumbing license and the gas license
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
where they show up they're showing that
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
they they have the equivalent education
 
01:56:26.589 --> 01:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
they get to take the tests and if they
 
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
pass the test they get the license so
 
01:56:31.709 --> 01:56:31.719 align:start position:0%
representative to answer your your your
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
question to Steve was what happens if in
 
01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
10 years you get your license should you
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
take a test well once you get your
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
license you have to go to continuing
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
education so we're going to continu
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
education every every year and if that
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
person gets their license in New
 
01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're going to have to go to
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
continuing education that New Hampshire
 
01:56:57.550 --> 01:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
uh approves anyways so the reciprocity
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
reciprocity you all know you know New
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's given something and the
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
other state is given something that's
 
01:57:07.149 --> 01:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
not the case in plumbing or gas they
 
01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
there I can't go to New Hampshire and
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
get the and get my license and I mean I
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
can't go to massachusett and get my
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
license just because I have a license in
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it will never happen if
 
01:57:19.119 --> 01:57:19.950 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it will never happen if
this

01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
passes I'm not quite sure why plumbers
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
are a little stubborn they think they
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
every state believes that their Plumbing
 
01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
does something special um but you know
 
01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
um they the reciprocity has been very
 
01:57:37.629 --> 01:57:37.639 align:start position:0%
very very tough to get with the new New
 
01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:41.560 align:start position:0%
England states so um with the gasfitters
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
association we believe that there should
 
01:57:46.589 --> 01:57:46.599 align:start position:0%
should be some type of testing mechanism
 
01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
that is involved in there so I think
 
01:57:52.589 --> 01:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time Mr
 
01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
Harrington good morning uh thank you to
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
the committee Madam chairman I'll keep
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
it brief I have a statement here on
 
01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of the mechanical licensing board
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
my name is Michael Harrison I'm a member
 
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
of that board I'm a master plumber in
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well as a certified gas
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
fitter uh I'm also a master plumber in
 
01:58:13.390 --> 01:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and um I'm the sponsor for
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
the apprenticeship program at Oliver
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
mechanical in Manchester New
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so I believe that I'm
 
01:58:22.109 --> 01:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
well placed um to answer any questions
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
that you may
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
have um allowing outof state licenses to
 
01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
reciprocate in New Hampshire without
 
01:58:30.430 --> 01:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
them having to be substantially similar
 
01:58:32.709 --> 01:58:32.719 align:start position:0%
to ours undermines Public
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
Safety as an example there are many
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
states across the country that do not
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
take the responsibility of providing
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
heating and plumbing services to their
 
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
citizens as seriously as
 
01:58:44.990 --> 01:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
ours one being our neighbors in Vermont
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
who do not require on the job training
 
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
prior to the issuance of licensure to
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
install gas fired
 
01:58:53.310 --> 01:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
appliances instead they rely on the
 
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
legal system to police this after the
 
01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
public has been
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
harmed the mechanical licensing and
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
safety board asks that New Hampshire not
 
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the citizens of New Hampshire
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
by allowing professional licensure to be
 
01:59:06.669 --> 01:59:06.679 align:start position:0%
eroded by the Legislative process thank
 
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
you for your time and
 
01:59:10.109 --> 01:59:10.119 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you very much are
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%

or both of you be willing to work with
 
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee because I think it's a
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
a real concern yes of course thank
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%

02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
submit written comment so I won't take
 
02:00:16.510 --> 02:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
up a lot of time you can read what we
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
submitted but I just wanted to point out
 
02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
that in the last decade so from 2013 to
 
02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
2023 21
 
02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:28.669 align:start position:0%
2023 21
states

02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
have switched to Universal licensed
 
02:00:34.750 --> 02:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
reciprocity laws they've adopted these
 
02:00:37.149 --> 02:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
laws uh so New Hampshire when it adopted
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
its law last year was not at the
 
02:00:42.030 --> 02:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
Vanguard of some movement we were way
 
02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
behind um this movement to recognize out
 
02:00:45.679 --> 02:00:46.830 align:start position:0%
behind um this movement to recognize out
ofate

02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
ofate
 
02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
licenses although were the first state
 
02:00:51.069 --> 02:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
in New England England to do
 
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
it but one thing that you'll notice in
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
these laws is that out of those 21 only
 
02:01:02.109 --> 02:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
nine have that requirement that we have
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
for substantially
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
similar license requirements among
 
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
states and in fact the experience has
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
been we've seen no States go backwards
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
and add that language in this last
 
02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
decade but we have seen states that
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
initially had it go back and take it
 
02:01:24.189 --> 02:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
out Missouri and uh New Mexico I think
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
were the two states who did that and the
 
02:01:28.830 --> 02:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
they did it because they were seeing
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
that it was causing problems
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
um we do not have evidence from research
 
02:01:35.639 --> 02:01:37.030 align:start position:0%
um we do not have evidence from research
that

02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
having really stringent occupational
 
02:01:42.750 --> 02:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
Licensing Laws um and you know when we
 
02:01:45.229 --> 02:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
have these variations in state laws that
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
that creates big variations in public
 
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
safety Public Health Health protections
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
that's just not the case based on
 
02:01:56.589 --> 02:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
studies we've been able to see of these
 
02:02:00.750 --> 02:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
laws but what we have seen is Big
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
variations in economic growth access and
 
02:02:10.069 --> 02:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
employment so you see
 
02:02:12.669 --> 02:02:12.679 align:start position:0%
substantial depressing effects on
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
employment from occupational Licensing
 
02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
Laws that are that are strict New
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a a pretty ser ious labor
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
shortage one of the reasons for passing
 
02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
the law last year was to help with that
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
labor shortage striking this language to
 
02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
do that I'd like to address some of the
 
02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:29.719 align:start position:0%
comments that have been said before
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
really quickly it is in fact not easy as
 
02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
it was suggested earlier to Simply
 
02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
defined substantially similar I'll give
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
you a couple of examples cosmetology New
 
02:02:44.910 --> 02:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is way out of line with the
 
02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
national Norm on cosmetology uh training
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
hours we require 1,500 hours of
 
02:02:51.199 --> 02:02:52.669 align:start position:0%
hours we require 1,500 hours of
cosmetology

02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
cosmetology
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
training uh the national the beauty
 
02:02:57.790 --> 02:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
Association nationally doesn't recommend
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
that many hours Massachusetts requires
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
only a thousand hours so if you were to
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
imagine that you can concoct some
 
02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
percentage 90% was suggested of hours of
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
training or hours of apprenticeships
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
well under that
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
standard no cosmetologist licensed in
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts could but could get a
 
02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire under
 
02:03:23.310 --> 02:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
reciprocity laws cuz their hours of
 
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
training are 33% lower than ours
 
02:03:29.069 --> 02:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
barbering is another example uh New
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire requires I think 800 hours of
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
training for
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
Barbers New York State requires 291
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
hours those are not substantially
 
02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
similar if you were to apply some you
 
02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
know uh percentage metric that might
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
sound good but no one here I I think
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
would suggest that uh Ryan CEST is
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
getting bad haircuts in New York City
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
because their Barbers only have fewer
 
02:03:58.910 --> 02:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
than 300 hours of training so it's not
 
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
as easy as it would seem to come up with
 
02:04:04.589 --> 02:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
a substantially similar test if you were
 
02:04:05.950 --> 02:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
to start to try to base it on
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
percentages and
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
numbers it is in fact quite um
 
02:04:12.990 --> 02:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
subjective the way we have it in law now
 
02:04:16.189 --> 02:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
we happen to have a really fabulous
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
director of
 
02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
oplc uh and I mean that seriously um who
 
02:04:22.990 --> 02:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
does great work trying to figure all
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
this stuff
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
out but you can't rely on that forever
 
02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
right and so it is pretty subjective the
 
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
problem with trying to make it more
 
02:04:38.589 --> 02:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
objective is then you get into these
 
02:04:40.830 --> 02:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
metrics that don't necessarily match up
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
so if we have a 33% difference in hours
 
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
of training in the classroom how do you
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
decide what is substantially similar to
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
that if you have different hours of
 
02:04:55.950 --> 02:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships or on the job training
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
it gets very complicated very quickly
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
which is why most of the states that
 
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
have gone to Universal Licensing Laws in
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
the last decade don't have this language
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
in the laws and a couple of them that
 
02:05:09.629 --> 02:05:09.639 align:start position:0%
did have pulled it back because it
 
02:05:09.639 --> 02:05:10.709 align:start position:0%
did have pulled it back because it
actually

02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:05:14.589 --> 02:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
is not they have found really doing a
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
great job to protect public health and
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
safety but it is fing employment and
 
02:05:23.629 --> 02:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
causing Mobility problems for their
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
states so I will leave it at that and
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
02:05:30.430 --> 02:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
representative lus and then groa thank
 
02:05:33.669 --> 02:05:33.679 align:start position:0%
you um so I mean a number of issues have
 
02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
been raised around uh removing
 
02:05:37.549 --> 02:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
substantially similar some of them are
 
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
around what are the licensing
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
differences in licensing requirements
 
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
but others that have been raised are
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
differences in the scope of practice
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
between you know what somebody with some
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
title can do a New Hampshire versus or
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
license can do New Hampshire versus
 
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
another state what I'm wondering is the
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
states have done this more you know they
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the language substantially
 
02:06:00.350 --> 02:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
similar what do they do and how do they
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
deal with that those sorts of issues
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I haven't gotten down into
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
the language of the laws in every one of
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
those 21 states so I don't know that I
 
02:06:11.950 --> 02:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
could speak um broadly on that but
 
02:06:14.270 --> 02:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
obviously you have to address the scope
 
02:06:16.270 --> 02:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
of practice right I mean that's just
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
something that um has to be addressed in
 
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
the law maybe there's a way to look at
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
it and look at what the other states
 
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
have done to
 
02:06:28.229 --> 02:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
to um to address that that issue I mean
 
02:06:29.709 --> 02:06:29.719 align:start position:0%
because that that is a legit issue and
 
02:06:32.189 --> 02:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
then obviously with the um the real
 
02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
estate is a great example if there are
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
specific laws that we have that um are
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
very different for New Hampshire so for
 
02:06:42.669 --> 02:06:42.679 align:start position:0%
just to give another example right
 
02:06:44.350 --> 02:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
barbering is barbering it doesn't matter
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
if you're cutting somebody's hair in
 
02:06:49.069 --> 02:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
California Florida or New York um that's
 
02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
different than real estate because the
 
02:06:53.069 --> 02:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
the actual laws about land use and
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
everything so you can see a couple of
 
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
things where you might want to carve out
 
02:06:59.310 --> 02:06:59.320 align:start position:0%
a profession um uh the law for example
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
right um that would be another one where
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
you might say okay that one will have
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
something but for most um occupations
 
02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:09.430 align:start position:0%
something but for most um occupations
you

02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
know the training what we found in
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the training requirements is
 
02:07:16.549 --> 02:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
you will occasionally find pretty big
 
02:07:21.149 --> 02:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
gaps like the hours gaps or um on the
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
job training gaps but what we've seen in
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
the last couple of decades is states are
 
02:07:31.629 --> 02:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
kind of coming together organically into
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
02:07:36.030 --> 02:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
more um a lot closer training
 
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
requirements we're not there yet so and
 
02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's part of the problem with the
 
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
substantially similar language it takes
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
time for these things to happen but for
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
basic professions that are um the same
 
02:07:47.950 --> 02:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
from state to state to state you're
 
02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
starting to see that they are kind of
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
gravitating towards you know sort of a a
 
02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
ballpark of Fairly widely accepted
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
standards follow up follow up okay so on
 
02:08:03.629 --> 02:08:03.639 align:start position:0%
the you know have these states just
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
playing you know remov substantially
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
similar what you said do they have it
 
02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
just if you have a license that's more
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
or less the covers the same area in
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
another state that you automatically get
 
02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
a license in their state so it's just
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
straight kind of re procy is the wrong
 
02:08:20.109 --> 02:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
word it's licensed by endorsement
 
02:08:23.149 --> 02:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
because well correct you know what do
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
they have any other caveats requirements
 
02:08:29.229 --> 02:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
or or whatever again I'd have to I
 
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to answer that question
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
without going through every single state
 
02:08:36.270 --> 02:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
law but um to the suggestion that the a
 
02:08:38.189 --> 02:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
good path would be reciprocity which
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
would really mean we only Grant a
 
02:08:42.430 --> 02:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
license from a state if that state
 
02:08:43.629 --> 02:08:43.639 align:start position:0%
grants a license in New Hampshire that
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
would actually be going backwards for
 
02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that would be um
 
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
economically very negative right so
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
right now we're saying if you have a
 
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
license in another state you can come
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
here Vis long substantially St we do not
 
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
want to go backwards and say um wait a
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
minute you have to recognize a New
 
02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license too that would
 
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
actually make it harder for us to
 
02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
recruit employees into New Hampshire so
 
02:09:07.390 --> 02:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want to go that way thank
 
02:09:10.830 --> 02:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you in your testimony to us
 
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
you said that there is um data that will
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that Licensing in New
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
they've removed this has expanded job
 
02:09:24.030 --> 02:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities where is where is that
 
02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
data I would be happy to send you reams
 
02:09:28.830 --> 02:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
of academic info showing that um please
 
02:09:30.430 --> 02:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
do yeah be happy to do that Josiah
 
02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
Bartlet Center for Public Policy jet.org
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
we have some of that stuff on our
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
website you have a gentleman here in the
 
02:09:40.109 --> 02:09:40.119 align:start position:0%
room whose organization has um done some
 
02:09:42.549 --> 02:09:42.559 align:start position:0%
of the best work uh in the country on
 
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
looking at those laws and and the
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
effects of them and they actually have
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
to answer a previous question you had
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
for a previous caller
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
um we do have PR previous caller
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
previous guest uh we do have lists of um
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
state requirements uh it's not for all
 
02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
200 occupations but for a lot of them
 
02:10:02.109 --> 02:10:02.119 align:start position:0%
you can actually see what each state
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
requires hours um tests that kind of
 
02:10:10.270 --> 02:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
thing so we love to see that yep okay
 
02:10:11.549 --> 02:10:11.559 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and then gold
 
02:10:16.589 --> 02:10:16.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mam Cher can you provide us a
 
02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
list of the 21 states you referenced
 
02:10:20.709 --> 02:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
earlier absolutely I'll send you a link
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
to that it was done by um a thing tank
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
in Washington called The archbridge
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
Institute they looked back at that I can
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
get you that study thank you represent
 
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
gold thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my question recently when I
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
was doing some research for another
 
02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
bill excuse
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
me there was a report done about a dozen
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
report sorry I get a tickle right it
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
always happens when you're starting to
 
02:10:55.229 --> 02:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
talk doesn't it Madam chair I'll have to
 
02:10:55.239 --> 02:10:56.750 align:start position:0%
talk doesn't it Madam chair I'll have to
pass

02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
okay represent goalie and then Brown
 
02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question you stated earlier
 
02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
just briefly a few minutes ago about
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and reciprocity is going
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
backwards yeah could
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
you then explain where a number of
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
licenses are starting to enter compact
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
is that going backwards as well uh based
 
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
on our current law I think that would go
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
backwards right so um if we already are
 
02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
accepting licenses from every other
 
02:11:29.950 --> 02:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
state why would
 
02:11:32.990 --> 02:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
we require that state to accept our
 
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
license if we're already getting the
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
benefits of having those people move
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
here I mean in general compacts are fine
 
02:11:40.830 --> 02:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
but uh we have a pretty good law that
 
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
already allows us to take people from
 
02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:45.350 align:start position:0%
already allows us to take people from
other

02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.709 --> 02:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
states represent Brown uh thank you
 
02:11:50.589 --> 02:11:50.599 align:start position:0%
madam chair following up on
 
02:11:52.830 --> 02:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative groa I I
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
believe it may be the same thing can you
 
02:11:59.430 --> 02:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
provide any links for studies I I think
 
02:12:02.669 --> 02:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
I believe you said that studies show
 
02:12:04.549 --> 02:12:04.559 align:start position:0%
there really isn't an impact on Public
 
02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
Safety in the in the varying differences
 
02:12:08.990 --> 02:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
between licenses yeah none that I've
 
02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:10.599 align:start position:0%
seen and I'll be happy to get you some
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
stuff uh that we have on that yeah thank
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
you representative gold if you if you've
 
02:12:19.390 --> 02:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
recovered yes I have thank you madam
 
02:12:23.069 --> 02:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
chair so um recently when I was doing
 
02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
some research for another bill I
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
discovered a report that was done about
 
02:12:28.669 --> 02:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
a dozen years
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
ago it was a federal report on licensing
 
02:12:35.069 --> 02:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
and it was written specifically to
 
02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
legislators in all the various States
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
comparing legislation across states are
 
02:12:40.629 --> 02:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
you familiar with that report does that
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
ring a bell uh Federal government's done
 
02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
quite a few things um during the Obama
 
02:12:45.790 --> 02:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
Administration the the Obama
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
Administration um I think we have that
 
02:12:50.189 --> 02:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
link on our website they they um
 
02:12:52.709 --> 02:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
underwent a very aggressive effort to
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
get states to roll back their licensing
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
requirements because the Obama
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
Administration found that it
 
02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
um these big differences in licensing
 
02:13:01.549 --> 02:13:01.559 align:start position:0%
requirements were causing a lot of
 
02:13:03.870 --> 02:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
income inequality and a lack of Mobility
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
right um the Federal Trade Commission in
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
2018 also um which I quoted in my
 
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
written testimony um has been
 
02:13:16.350 --> 02:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
aggressively pushing for uh lowering
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
barriers to cross state um license
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
transportation and so you um followup
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
Madam chair follow up and so my question
 
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
was in response to some of that work
 
02:13:28.549 --> 02:13:28.559 align:start position:0%
that research do you think that that's
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
been driving some of the changes you
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
were talking about where states are
 
02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
becoming more standard no thank you
 
02:13:37.310 --> 02:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um yeah in in so
 
02:13:39.870 --> 02:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
the Biden Administration uh the Obama
 
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
Administration and the Trump
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
Administration all I mean this is a very
 
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh thing they have all pushed
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
um lowering license requirements at the
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
state level and advancing reciprocity
 
02:13:53.549 --> 02:13:53.559 align:start position:0%
and they've done that mostly because uh
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
the FTC Zone work some uh federal
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
government work but a lot of academic
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
research done on this across the country
 
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
at various universities has found um
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
remarkably similar effects uh from
 
02:14:09.870 --> 02:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
Licensing Laws that reduce um Mobility
 
02:14:12.149 --> 02:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
reduce employment uh pretty negative
 
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
economic effects so the economic
 
02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
research on this is quite strong
 
02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
follow thank you madam chair and so what
 
02:14:24.430 --> 02:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
I recall from those reports is that New
 
02:14:26.669 --> 02:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ranked pretty low in terms of
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
overall demands for licensing on the
 
02:14:33.390 --> 02:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
citizenry percentage wise and back then
 
02:14:37.549 --> 02:14:37.559 align:start position:0%
at that time and um and so even though
 
02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
we have higher
 
02:14:41.229 --> 02:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
requirements uh for some of our
 
02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
professions I I hope we can keep our
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
overall numbers low uh I think there's a
 
02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
gentleman in the room that could put us
 
02:14:51.629 --> 02:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
um better pegged currently and where we
 
02:14:55.149 --> 02:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
stand national ranking wise okay other
 
02:14:58.030 --> 02:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
questions for this for the chair um so
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
the I he refering sending things to us I
 
02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
think on prior bills people may have
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that things that I haven't
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
seen in the email is there a mechanism
 
02:15:06.990 --> 02:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody submits online to the online
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
testimony for us to actually get it how
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
does that work that's an excellent
 
02:15:13.549 --> 02:15:13.559 align:start position:0%
question representative I will research
 
02:15:16.430 --> 02:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
it and get back to you I just to to I I
 
02:15:18.669 --> 02:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
submitted that shortly before here only
 
02:15:21.229 --> 02:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
because my printer stopped working so
 
02:15:22.990 --> 02:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's why it was submitted online um
 
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
but I can send you links and everything
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
else if I can do follow yeah you didn't
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
you did not send it to the committee as
 
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
email it it went through the online
 
02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
meeting online portal correct thank you
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
that I have to apologize for not having
 
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:42.760 align:start position:0%

02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
similar that would be fine Madam chair

to speak to you about HB uh
 
02:16:28.189 --> 02:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
1272 um that bill seeks to remove as you
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
know the requirement of substantial
 
02:16:32.509 --> 02:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
equivalency for reciprocal licensing of
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
CPAs in New Hampshire for accountants
 
02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
otherwise licensed in other
 
02:16:39.509 --> 02:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions as an initial matter I
 
02:16:42.190 --> 02:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
would Echo many of the comments of
 
02:16:45.469 --> 02:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
executive executive director Courtney
 
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
and one comment in particular and that
 
02:16:50.669 --> 02:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
is you got this right last year and
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
please don't fix what ain't
 
02:16:54.990 --> 02:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
broken um on behalf of the board of
 
02:16:57.790 --> 02:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
accountancy I have submitted a letter to
 
02:17:00.669 --> 02:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
you that expresses our concerns and
 
02:17:04.270 --> 02:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill as well as HB uh
 
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
1676 which you're going to hear about uh
 
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
here shortly this afternoon
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
um these bills especially 1676 have
 
02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately the uh the purpose of the
 
02:17:19.469 --> 02:17:19.479 align:start position:0%
abolition abolition of the board and the
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
protections to Commerce and the public
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
interest by the board and excuse me Mr
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
Powell please do not impune the motives
 
02:17:28.990 --> 02:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
you can speak to what the facts are but
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
please don't assume you know why
 
02:17:33.509 --> 02:17:33.519 align:start position:0%
somebody did something thank you yes
 
02:17:36.270 --> 02:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I didn't mean any uh insult
 
02:17:40.389 --> 02:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
by that um I think that uh the effect of
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
1676 is is plain that's all I was
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
referring to um perhaps reading a couple
 
02:17:49.309 --> 02:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
of quotes from opal C's website and from
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
the board's authorizing statute which is
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
RSA 309b will help illustrate why the
 
02:17:57.629 --> 02:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
board of accountancy opposes the
 
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
legislation opl C's website states that
 
02:18:03.150 --> 02:18:03.160 align:start position:0%
the board of accountancy's mission is to
 
02:18:05.389 --> 02:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
ensure the applicant that applicants are
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
qualified for lure the board sets
 
02:18:10.110 --> 02:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
standards for the profession by
 
02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
proposing statutes and adopting
 
02:18:14.589 --> 02:18:14.599 align:start position:0%
administrative rules investigating
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
complaints of unprofessional conduct and
 
02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
taking disciplinary action against
 
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
lenses when necessary to protect the
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
public and I emphasize to protect the
 
02:18:30.270 --> 02:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
public um end quote there similarly RSA
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
309 B2 provides as follows it is the
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
policy of the State of New Hampshire and
 
02:18:38.669 --> 02:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this chapter to promote
 
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
the reliability of information that is
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
used for guidance in financial
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
transactions or for accounting uh I'm

there the policies endorsed by these

references are as relevant today as
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
they've always been this is a serious
 
02:19:14.349 --> 02:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
and vital issue the board the
 
02:19:16.629 --> 02:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
requirements established by the board
 
02:19:19.509 --> 02:19:19.519 align:start position:0%
and oversight by the board exists to
 
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
ensure reliability of financial
 
02:19:24.990 --> 02:19:25.000 align:start position:0%

02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
stated by executive director Courtney
 
02:19:31.230 --> 02:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
earlier today it also is intended to
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
protect Commerce within the state
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're not burdensome they are
 
02:19:37.429 --> 02:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
necessary that's the position of the
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
board of accountancy hb1 1272 and other
 
02:19:45.309 --> 02:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
related leg legislation such as hb1 uh
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
1676 We Believe will dimin Minish these
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
protections by eliminating the
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
requirements established by the board
 
02:19:54.750 --> 02:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
and ultimately by completely eliminating
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
board oversight with regard to the
 
02:19:59.070 --> 02:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications and the conduct of
 
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
persons and firms subject to regulation
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire
 
02:20:06.670 --> 02:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
law um this bill in particular in bills
 
02:20:09.309 --> 02:20:09.319 align:start position:0%
under current consideration eliminate
 
02:20:11.710 --> 02:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
the assurances provided by the board of
 
02:20:13.389 --> 02:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
oversight by removing the board's
 
02:20:16.110 --> 02:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
determination as to whether a proposed
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
lense E From Another state is an
 
02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate leny in this state the board
 
02:20:23.070 --> 02:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
does not believe that the proposed
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
legislation will ensure that all
 
02:20:27.309 --> 02:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
potential licenses meet sufficient
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
benchmarks to protect the public it does
 
02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
not take into account the lack of
 
02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
consistency for example between
 
02:20:36.870 --> 02:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions nor does it take into
 
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
consideration the fact that the
 
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
substantial equivalency requirement has
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
not even been tested this is the
 
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
requirement that was established uh last
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
year has not not even been tested as it
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
is brand new only have having been
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
recently enacted we believe um that at a
 
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
minimum the substantial equivalency
 
02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
requirement should be tried and tested
 
02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
before further alterations amendments or
 
02:21:06.429 --> 02:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
modifications are contemplated We
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
Believe therefore that hp1 uh 1272 is
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
misguided and should be rejected thank
 
02:21:14.830 --> 02:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
you for hearing me I'll entertain any
 
02:21:16.630 --> 02:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee might have
 
02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:20.990 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee might have
your

02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you madam chair and
 
02:21:24.670 --> 02:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee me members for
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to speak um
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
this is my first time doing this so I
 
02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
may not be as formal as some of the
 
02:21:33.429 --> 02:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
others my name is Edward C David I'm a
 
02:21:36.910 --> 02:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
CPA which stands for certified public
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
accountant I live in
 
02:21:39.439 --> 02:21:41.510 align:start position:0%
accountant I live in
Seabrook

02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
Seabrook
 
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
and we request the board of I am
 
02:21:46.270 --> 02:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
currently the chair of the board of
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
accountancy as well so I guess I should
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
mention that we did have an emergency
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
meeting this morning to cover a couple
 
02:21:54.270 --> 02:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
of these house bills and at that meeting
 
02:21:57.950 --> 02:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
there was a vote taken that that we come
 
02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
to you and ask for you to reject this
 
02:22:04.429 --> 02:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
bill reciprocity and Mobility has been
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
the key to the accounting profession for
 
02:22:10.990 --> 02:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
many many years our exam it's a national
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
exam it's an exam that is coordinated
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
between the American Institute of CPA
 
02:22:20.469 --> 02:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
and the National Association of State
 
02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
Board of accountancy this is not a
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
different exam by
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:31.469 --> 02:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
different I'm going to give you a little
 
02:22:33.630 --> 02:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
family story so I hope I do not bore you
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
details again my name is Ed David 1986 I
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
graduated from
 
02:22:43.070 --> 02:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
college by within three years I had
 
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
passed the CPA
 
02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
exam I had three years of experience
 
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
what did experience mean it meant that I
 
02:22:52.190 --> 02:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
Was preparing
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
audits reviewed level financial
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
statements compilations corporate tax
 
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
returns partnership tax returns
 
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
individual tax returns and Trust tax
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
returns I had to specify to the state of
 
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the number of hours I had
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
in each one of these
 
02:23:11.590 --> 02:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
categories so my CPA certificate from
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is dated June
 
02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.070 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is dated June
of

02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:17.750 align:start position:0%
of
1989

02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
1989
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
so that's the David story since then for
 
02:23:23.590 --> 02:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
almost 38 years which will be this may I
 
02:23:25.150 --> 02:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
have been working in public accounting
 
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
doing those same
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
skills my sister-in-law
 
02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
Jean I love her 1980 she graduated from
 
02:23:37.269 --> 02:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
college then she went down to Texas A&amp;M
 
02:23:39.710 --> 02:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
to get to work on her Masters while she
 
02:23:42.990 --> 02:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
was down there she passed the CPA exam
 
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
again the exact same exam I took Tech
 
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
Tas had no experience requirements she
 
02:23:55.230 --> 02:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
became a CPA the day she passed her
 
02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
test her CPE that she
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
takes she gets credit for the classes
 
02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
she teaches as a professor my
 
02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
sister-in-law again I love
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
her she has spent her entire career in
 
02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
Academia and not once prepared an
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
audited financial statement a tax return
 
02:24:18.429 --> 02:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
a review level financial statement she
 
02:24:21.070 --> 02:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't done Consulting with contractors
 
02:24:22.830 --> 02:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
and all the things that I have done over
 
02:24:26.429 --> 02:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
the past 38 years so I would ask this
 
02:24:30.950 --> 02:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
board are our two experiences the
 
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
same I have worked for 38 years ensuring
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
our public interests ensuring that the
 
02:24:40.349 --> 02:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
financial statements for our clients
 
02:24:42.750 --> 02:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
meet the qualifications and meet the
 
02:24:45.790 --> 02:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
banking standards I have issued going
 
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
concern reports which tells the
 
02:24:52.030 --> 02:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
bank this client is not doing so well
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
you probably should not be lending the
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
money because our ethics required it and
 
02:25:00.910 --> 02:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
I did it and I question again with us
 
02:25:02.750 --> 02:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been in Academia her
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
whole profession whether she'd be able
 
02:25:09.389 --> 02:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
to so last year my brother and his wife
 
02:25:12.429 --> 02:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
moved Virginia refused to Grant her a
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
CPA license due to the fact that her
 
02:25:20.030 --> 02:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:23.950 --> 02:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
Academia so I humbly request that this
 
02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
committee rejects this proposed house
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
bill as in my opinion it's going to
 
02:25:33.230 --> 02:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
diminish the protection of our public
 
02:25:35.230 --> 02:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
that we've been working with for so many
 
02:25:37.469 --> 02:25:37.479 align:start position:0%

02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
assuming that as members of the board uh
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
you folks use that language
 
02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
substantially similar to apply your
 
02:26:37.870 --> 02:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
practices to anything anybody applying
 
02:26:40.550 --> 02:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh in your collaboration with oplc would
 
02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
that be a true
 
02:26:44.429 --> 02:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
statement it's a true statement but we
 
02:26:46.349 --> 02:26:46.359 align:start position:0%
also have the assistance of the national
 
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
accounting state board um they they uh
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
Interlink between oplc and the different
 
02:26:56.910 --> 02:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
states so they provide us with the
 
02:27:01.230 --> 02:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
information as to the state rules so for
 
02:27:03.550 --> 02:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
the most part we're covered on that my
 
02:27:05.070 --> 02:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
my system Law's issue I don't think
 
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
anybody would ever know it thank you for
 
02:27:10.269 --> 02:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
that Insight if I may add something to
 
02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
that Madam chair please um the
 
02:27:15.790 --> 02:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
substantial equivalency uh language is
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
so new that we really have had little to
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
no opportunity to really work with it at
 
02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
this point so
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I I anticipate that it would be a
 
02:27:26.590 --> 02:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
Cooperative relationship and
 
02:27:29.550 --> 02:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
determinations made but again it is
 
02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
extremely new thank you madam chair Yes
 
02:27:35.550 --> 02:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
except that I'm sure you have had
 
02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
applications from accountants from other
 
02:27:42.349 --> 02:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
states ever since the board was founded
 
02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
and you made judgments one at a time if
 
02:27:48.190 --> 02:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
their experience was similar more yes
 
02:27:49.870 --> 02:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
what has what has happened in that issue
 
02:27:55.950 --> 02:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
is the O OPC reviews the uh request and
 
02:27:57.630 --> 02:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
when there are issues they have brought
 
02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
them to our board to oversee to see if
 
02:28:03.389 --> 02:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
we can work out the issues but um oplc
 
02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
has been dealing with that most of last
 
02:28:08.309 --> 02:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
few years yes the board of accountancy
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'm has been around for I don't know
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's 50 years or 100 years but that
 
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
you've been around a long time and I'm
 
02:28:17.389 --> 02:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
sure You'
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
had uh people moving to the state who
 
02:28:23.269 --> 02:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
want to be accountants yes what happens
 
02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
they provide us with the information
 
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
that is requested in the application
 
02:28:30.309 --> 02:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
which is their um CPA license from the
 
02:28:32.910 --> 02:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
init their initial State the continue in
 
02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
professional education since they you
 
02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
know the last three years um and they do
 
02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
provide letters from I believe it's one
 
02:28:45.389 --> 02:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
client one non-family member and I
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
forget who the may be two clients but
 
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
there's a couple series of letters that
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
they provide us thank
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%

the committee good afternoon my name is
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
Lee McGrath I'm a senior legislative
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
councel for the institute for justice uh
 
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:28.920 align:start position:0%

enthusiastically uh voice my support my
 
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
colleague support for hb1
 
02:29:37.950 --> 02:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
1272 I have just a couple of reasons for
 
02:29:41.309 --> 02:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
why uh you should uh you should support
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and given it your
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation that it ought to p uh
 
02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:47.110 align:start position:0%
recommendation that it ought to p uh
pass

02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
but more importantly I I want to respond
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
to some of the questions that have been
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
been asked here important important uh
 
02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:55.950 align:start position:0%
been asked here important important uh
uh

02:29:55.950 --> 02:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:58.510 --> 02:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
questions uh there are two main reasons
 
02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
before getting to the questions there
 
02:30:04.110 --> 02:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
are two main reasons for you to grab
 
02:30:08.110 --> 02:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
this uh I issue uh occupational
 
02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
licensing is the biggest labor market
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
issue in the state of New Hampshire you
 
02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
own it it should not be delegated to the
 
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
executive branch you should set the
 
02:30:23.630 --> 02:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
policy because in New Hampshire
 
02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
approximately 17% of all workers need a
 
02:30:31.950 --> 02:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
license to work that is larger than the
 
02:30:36.030 --> 02:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
10% of union members and larger than the
 
02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
2% of New Hampshire workers who earn the
 
02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
minimum wage this is the most important
 
02:30:47.269 --> 02:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
is issue in labor markets today
 
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
and I agree with my my friend Drew
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
kleene uh that Miss Courtney is very
 
02:30:58.269 --> 02:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
talented and one of the the the best uh
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
executive directors in the country I put
 
02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
her up up there with Vermont and Utah
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
and Colorado but you the voice of the
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
people you have the legitim the
 
02:31:14.429 --> 02:31:14.439 align:start position:0%
Democratic legitim legitimacy and you
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
should not delegate your authority to
 
02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu's admin Administration
 
02:31:23.710 --> 02:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
for many reasons including that Miss
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
Courtney may go on to other
 
02:31:30.670 --> 02:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
things secondly you want to reduce
 
02:31:34.110 --> 02:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
burdens you do not you like you should
 
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
like this bill because it sets a
 
02:31:40.269 --> 02:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
rule and you may add to it in the
 
02:31:43.790 --> 02:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee some exceptions but don't
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
let the exceptions Drive the the rule
 
02:31:51.630 --> 02:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
the need to a question about need it was
 
02:31:53.389 --> 02:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
discussed identified earlier that there
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
are approximately 200 licenses in New
 
02:31:57.389 --> 02:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and only
 
02:32:02.510 --> 02:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
13 have some level of recognition or or
 
02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
reciprocity so let this bill be the rule
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
and then subsequently identify the
 
02:32:12.429 --> 02:32:12.439 align:start position:0%
exceptions for some of the idiosyncratic
 
02:32:15.070 --> 02:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
dynamics that exist in New Hampshire
 
02:32:18.670 --> 02:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
like land surveying or or archaic real
 
02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:22.830 align:start position:0%
like land surveying or or archaic real
estate

02:32:22.830 --> 02:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:25.150 --> 02:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
laws the second reason is well
 
02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
identified Mobility you have a labor
 
02:32:31.590 --> 02:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
shortage that is well identified uh in
 
02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
the in this but let me jump to the
 
02:32:37.950 --> 02:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gro you wisely
 
02:32:40.990 --> 02:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
asked the question about
 
02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
burdens and how New Hampshire compares
 
02:32:46.230 --> 02:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
to other states my colleagues at the in
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
Institute for justice have have looked
 
02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:50.150 align:start position:0%
Institute for justice have have looked
at

02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:54.269 --> 02:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
102 low to medium skilled licenses and
 
02:32:59.070 --> 02:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the 12th least
 
02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
burdensome licenses that we we looked
 
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
looked at so you should not one should
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
not engage in this the mythology that
 
02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
people from a low regulation state that
 
02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
always it's always pointed out
 
02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:16.870 align:start position:0%
always it's always pointed out
Mississippi

02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
Mississippi
 
02:33:20.750 --> 02:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
are unskilled should they move to New
 
02:33:23.469 --> 02:33:23.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the reality is that the states
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
that are less burdensome than New
 
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are Indiana Kentucky Missouri
 
02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
Texas Kansas Colorado
 
02:33:37.389 --> 02:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
Minnesota where I live Montana South
 
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
Dakota Vermont and W Wyoming so you
 
02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
already are recognizing a lot of
 
02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
licenses this Bill codifies the reality
 
02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has a light touch
 
02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the burdens that it
 
02:33:59.790 --> 02:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
puts on low and medium skilled
 
02:34:04.190 --> 02:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
workers representative maputi you raised
 
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
a very
 
02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
important question about consumer
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
protection and and the evidence is clear
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
in Border studies where the N Center for
 
02:34:21.309 --> 02:34:21.319 align:start position:0%
regulation occupational regulations out
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
of West Virginia has looked at
 
02:34:29.469 --> 02:34:29.479 align:start position:0%
licenses in border states and there is
 
02:34:34.110 --> 02:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
no evidence of the if uh that lower
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
burdens cause more consumer complaints
 
02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
than higher higher burdens the presence
 
02:34:44.349 --> 02:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
of a license is
 
02:34:48.030 --> 02:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
important it has important signaling
 
02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
benefits to Consumers it is a vehicle
 
02:34:54.349 --> 02:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
for enforcement and someone losing their
 
02:34:58.230 --> 02:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
license but the inherent difference is
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
not all that great as it relates to
 
02:35:10.910 --> 02:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.190 --> 02:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
protection representative O'Brien you
 
02:35:16.110 --> 02:35:16.120 align:start position:0%
asked a question I think about
 
02:35:17.910 --> 02:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien is not here his
 
02:35:23.190 --> 02:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
proxy asked a
 
02:35:27.469 --> 02:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
question oh sorry sorry representative
 
02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
well if McGrath can't get differentiate
 
02:35:32.469 --> 02:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
O'Brien and Fitzpatrick we are we are
 
02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
lost we are Lo lost here so I think you
 
02:35:38.670 --> 02:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
were the one representative Fitzpatrick
 
02:35:42.429 --> 02:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
who who asked about compact about
 
02:35:46.510 --> 02:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
wanting other states to represent to
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
allow Granite Staters to come in their
 
02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
state as a prerequisite for your doing
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
doing that there is a compact movement
 
02:35:59.309 --> 02:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
but it's a slow movement the only real
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
successful compact has been the nursing
 
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
Compact and New Hampshire is one of 38
 
02:36:06.910 --> 02:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
states that is a member of the nursing
 
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
compact it is working the Department of
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
Defense recently funded 10 Mill uh $10
 
02:36:16.269 --> 02:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
million to look at 10 other compacts
 
02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
slow slow
 
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.030 align:start position:0%
slow slow
slow

02:36:22.030 --> 02:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
and this should not be the Principal way
 
02:36:29.309 --> 02:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
in which New Hampshire or any other
 
02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
state for that that
 
02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
matter attempts to attract new employ
 
02:36:38.429 --> 02:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
new employees new
 
02:36:42.030 --> 02:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
workers more competition more consumer
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
consumer uh Cho
 
02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:51.429 align:start position:0%
consumer uh Cho
choices

02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.870 --> 02:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:00.510 --> 02:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
chair you have a model of
 
02:37:04.030 --> 02:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
success in that this is not new it's not
 
02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
new to New Hampshire and as Drew Klein
 
02:37:09.230 --> 02:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
suggested that the majority of the 20
 
02:37:12.910 --> 02:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
states that have introduced this do it
 
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
as representative power is suggesting
 
02:37:17.269 --> 02:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
with out
 
02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
substantially substantially equivalent
 
02:37:20.319 --> 02:37:22.950 align:start position:0%
substantially substantially equivalent
that

02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:25.870 --> 02:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
requirement Arizona was the first now
 
02:37:28.269 --> 02:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons to move to AR
 
02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
Arizona but 9,000 people have moved to
 
02:37:37.030 --> 02:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
Arizona and gotten their licenses
 
02:37:40.349 --> 02:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
immediately recognized when they move
 
02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
there and most interesting I think for
 
02:37:46.110 --> 02:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
granite Staters is that 38% of those
 
02:37:48.670 --> 02:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
were building contractors so to the
 
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
extent that you have a housing shortage
 
02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
you should be particularly sensitive to
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
reducing whatever barrier you can for
 
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
those who build new new H new houses
 
02:38:03.870 --> 02:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
with that Madam chair I'm happy to
 
02:38:06.190 --> 02:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about the work of
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
the institute for for justice uh what I
 
02:38:12.110 --> 02:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
any questions about what's happening in
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
other other states or questions about CP
 
02:38:19.389 --> 02:38:19.399 align:start position:0%
a or anything like that thank you there
 
02:38:22.389 --> 02:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
was one question earlier that you might
 
02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
have the answer to and that is specific
 
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
language from other states that have
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
adopted this and in particular some of
 
02:38:36.550 --> 02:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
our thorny issues yes don't let uh Madam
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
chair members don't let the Tail Wag the
 
02:38:44.269 --> 02:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
Dog if you have certain
 
02:38:49.269 --> 02:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
idiosyncratic uh rules about uh real
 
02:38:54.870 --> 02:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
estate or land land make the the person
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
coming to Vermont uh coming to New
 
02:39:00.469 --> 02:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pass that jurisprudential
 
02:39:02.349 --> 02:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
legal te
 
02:39:04.950 --> 02:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
test you can put that in you can make
 
02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
that a a require requirement and that I
 
02:39:11.389 --> 02:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
think is the subject matter of what the
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee like might look at whereas
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
where do you want to had the additional
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
requirement for a handful of licenses
 
02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire is particularly
 
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
idiosyncratic as it relates to
 
02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
law thank you representative leus thank
 
02:39:31.550 --> 02:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
you um kind of on that subject the other
 
02:39:34.590 --> 02:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
issue that was raised was um differences
 
02:39:36.910 --> 02:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
in scope of practice between licenses in
 
02:39:38.670 --> 02:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire versus other states I'm
 
02:39:41.269 --> 02:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
curious on the 20 states that have done
 
02:39:44.750 --> 02:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
this um did they do anything to deal
 
02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
with that and if so
 
02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
how uh Madame chair Representative leas
 
02:39:53.269 --> 02:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
no to the to the what has been happening
 
02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
in the 20 States has mostly been on the
 
02:39:57.870 --> 02:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
credentialing side the qualification
 
02:40:01.950 --> 02:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
side it has been left up to the
 
02:40:05.309 --> 02:40:05.319 align:start position:0%
counterparts of Miss uh Courtney to and
 
02:40:09.389 --> 02:40:09.399 align:start position:0%
staffs like that to determine if it's if
 
02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's apples and apples so her comments
 
02:40:14.030 --> 02:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
earlier about apples and apples
 
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
comparison are very very relevant as it
 
02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
relates to scope of of practice that
 
02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
comes in every once in a while in the
 
02:40:25.630 --> 02:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
medical Prof professions particularly
 
02:40:30.030 --> 02:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
with LPNs and and and others but that is
 
02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:31.790 align:start position:0%
with LPNs and and and others but that is
is

02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh there is such except for a few there
 
02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
is such standardization in scope of
 
02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
practice that uh it is been there's been
 
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
difference to uh agencies like yours
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
just a quick followup followup so to
 
02:40:50.670 --> 02:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand so in those cases
 
02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
where there is a non-trivial difference
 
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
in scope of practice they just don't
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
consider an equivalent and they don't
 
02:40:59.710 --> 02:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
have reciprocity in those cases is that
 
02:41:02.790 --> 02:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
correct yes thank you
 
02:41:05.710 --> 02:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative G thank you madam
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
question regarding some of the
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
statistics you gave us you said that
 
02:41:13.309 --> 02:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
177% of New Hampshire residents are
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
licensed was that correct yes and so my
 
02:41:19.630 --> 02:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
question is comparing that Nationwide
 
02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
you then said TW we're the 12th least
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
bism state but that's a different that's
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
a different issue uhuh and so c um can
 
02:41:31.349 --> 02:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
you tell us of with a number like 177%
 
02:41:33.230 --> 02:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire how that compares
 
02:41:35.630 --> 02:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
Nationwide it is uh Madam chair
 
02:41:37.550 --> 02:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative ghoul it is
 
02:41:40.750 --> 02:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
lower on a national basis approximately
 
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
20% of all Americans need a license to
 
02:41:48.990 --> 02:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
work at 17 % New Hampshire is below
 
02:41:54.429 --> 02:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
below uh uh that that number in our re
 
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
research just looking at 102 lad to
 
02:42:03.950 --> 02:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
medium medium uh licenses uh New
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we consider the 41st best
 
02:42:12.150 --> 02:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
state in in the nation because New
 
02:42:16.110 --> 02:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only licenses of these
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
238 and the burden is light a light
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
touch as I expressed but don't pat
 
02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
yourself too hard on your on the on the
 
02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
back because Vermont is better ver
 
02:42:32.910 --> 02:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
Vermont has the uh is the very be tied
 
02:42:36.190 --> 02:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
with Wyoming as the very best state and
 
02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
so there's a culture in Vermont to be
 
02:42:44.429 --> 02:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
very skeptical about licenses and and uh
 
02:42:46.670 --> 02:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
to use them very very infrequently
 
02:42:48.510 --> 02:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
because they want people to be able to
 
02:42:49.910 --> 02:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
pursue their
 
02:42:53.429 --> 02:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
calling thank you other
 
02:42:56.990 --> 02:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to speak
 
02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:05.710 --> 02:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
1272 all right seeing none I will close
 
02:43:08.590 --> 02:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing representative laus will be
 
02:43:10.510 --> 02:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
scheduling the subcommittee meeting at
 
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
his earliest
 
02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
convenience and we will resume at 130
 
02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.279 --> 03:21:40.830 align:start position:0%
 
bit

03:21:40.830 --> 03:21:40.840 align:start position:0%

Lord

03:32:23.469 --> 03:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:26.429 --> 03:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
good good afternoon uh I guess I bang
 
03:32:30.269 --> 03:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:33.429 --> 03:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
start and
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:39.840 --> 03:32:43.309 align:start position:0%
 
up

03:32:43.309 --> 03:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:48.309 --> 03:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:52.429 --> 03:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
you I was just going to see what we were
 
03:32:55.030 --> 03:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
doing it would appear to be
 
03:32:55.040 --> 03:33:08.070 align:start position:0%
doing it would appear to be
representative

03:33:08.070 --> 03:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
leus hello thank you um uh
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative Tony luus for the record
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
representing uh the towns of Hudson and
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
Lichfield so I'm uh
 
03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill
 
03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
1676 to establish a sunset commission to
 
03:33:30.269 --> 03:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
evaluate the need for uh existence and
 
03:33:33.429 --> 03:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
changes for occupational licensing and
 
03:33:36.590 --> 03:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
the basic idea and first of
 
03:33:38.630 --> 03:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
all uh not just from what we heard
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
earlier today but from email I've gotten
 
03:33:43.070 --> 03:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
and people who button hold me you know
 
03:33:45.110 --> 03:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
there seems to be the impression that
 
03:33:47.309 --> 03:33:47.319 align:start position:0%
the effect and maybe the intent of this
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
bill is to get rid of Licensing and get
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
rid of all or particular licensing
 
03:33:54.349 --> 03:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
boards and that is very far from the
 
03:33:57.070 --> 03:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
truth that is not what is intended and
 
03:33:59.590 --> 03:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
even if this already become law I would
 
03:34:03.750 --> 03:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
be very surprised if uh any boards are
 
03:34:06.150 --> 03:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
completely eliminated or any licenses I
 
03:34:08.790 --> 03:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
mean it might happen but that's not the
 
03:34:13.469 --> 03:34:13.479 align:start position:0%
intent um it establishes a uh Sunset
 
03:34:17.550 --> 03:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
commission which is charged to review uh
 
03:34:20.189 --> 03:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
evaluate the need for performance of and
 
03:34:22.389 --> 03:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
possible improvements to the boards on
 
03:34:24.790 --> 03:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
commissions under review and the proper
 
03:34:27.670 --> 03:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
type of laws and rules regulating
 
03:34:30.189 --> 03:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
occupations I would say this is similar
 
03:34:32.830 --> 03:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
to the current situation where rules
 
03:34:34.389 --> 03:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
expire every 10
 
03:34:38.349 --> 03:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
years because that forces um a look
 
03:34:40.750 --> 03:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
again by the uh you know whatever
 
03:34:42.389 --> 03:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
department has issued those rules they
 
03:34:46.990 --> 03:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:49.830 --> 03:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
rejuso the joint legislative committee
 
03:34:49.840 --> 03:34:50.469 align:start position:0%
rejuso the joint legislative committee
on

03:34:50.469 --> 03:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:34:52.990 --> 03:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
rules and this is basically the same
 
03:34:59.189 --> 03:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
thing um you know the question is um
 
03:35:00.910 --> 03:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
well the purpose of Occupational
 
03:35:02.590 --> 03:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
licensing there's one and only one
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
legitimate purpose and that is to
 
03:35:07.950 --> 03:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
protect public health and safety so the
 
03:35:10.830 --> 03:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
question I mean it's not to validate the
 
03:35:12.269 --> 03:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
value of a
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
profession um or anything like that it's
 
03:35:16.110 --> 03:35:16.120 align:start position:0%
to protect the people of the State of
 
03:35:19.189 --> 03:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so the question is is
 
03:35:20.670 --> 03:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
the current
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
structure of uh of the licensing regime
 
03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
for a particular
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
profession is it still the best way to
 
03:35:33.469 --> 03:35:33.479 align:start position:0%
do that um you know it could be that
 
03:35:35.070 --> 03:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
there are situations where it could be
 
03:35:37.910 --> 03:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
better uh do a better job of protecting
 
03:35:40.150 --> 03:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
health and safety the public or there
 
03:35:41.910 --> 03:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
could be uh circumstances where there
 
03:35:44.750 --> 03:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
changes should be made to reduce the
 
03:35:48.389 --> 03:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
burden on the people being licensed and
 
03:35:50.189 --> 03:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
to allow it make it easier for people to
 
03:35:53.309 --> 03:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
enter the profession but still do a good
 
03:35:55.269 --> 03:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
job of protecting public health and
 
03:35:58.710 --> 03:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
safety and and the reason for the
 
03:36:01.830 --> 03:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
repeals is that it forces the commission
 
03:36:04.229 --> 03:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
to do that job well at least hopefully
 
03:36:06.630 --> 03:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
does it puts pressure on them to make
 
03:36:10.510 --> 03:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
sure they review uh each one of these um
 
03:36:12.110 --> 03:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know boards and the licenses that
 
03:36:14.269 --> 03:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
they're under if you look at the statute
 
03:36:16.950 --> 03:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
it requires the commission to start
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
looking and reviewing um each one of
 
03:36:22.030 --> 03:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
those at least one year before they
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
expire and the reason they're done in
 
03:36:26.550 --> 03:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
chunks not all at the same time is you
 
03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
know if all of them expired at once that
 
03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
would just be too much of our G gantu
 
03:36:33.150 --> 03:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
and job for the commission to really do
 
03:36:34.830 --> 03:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
an effective
 
03:36:34.840 --> 03:36:37.150 align:start position:0%
an effective
job

03:36:37.150 --> 03:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
job
 
03:36:39.710 --> 03:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
um and so the commission will be
 
03:36:41.389 --> 03:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for investigating the need
 
03:36:43.189 --> 03:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
for performance of an improvements to
 
03:36:45.269 --> 03:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
licensing statutes administrative rules
 
03:36:48.189 --> 03:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
and boards that are scheduled to
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
Sunset and they're uh excuse me can you
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
tell us where you're at
 
03:36:56.030 --> 03:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
Tony sorry I'll do that I'm on uh the
 
03:37:01.110 --> 03:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
first page starting at line 22
 
03:37:01.120 --> 03:37:03.510 align:start position:0%
first page starting at line 22
sorry

03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:37:06.429 --> 03:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
um and and it gets then further there's
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
some um it's part of the charge to the
 
03:37:10.550 --> 03:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
commission you know what what should
 
03:37:12.030 --> 03:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
they be doing and what things should
 
03:37:14.830 --> 03:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
they consider but it does not
 
03:37:17.229 --> 03:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
require that they you know anything
 
03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
about the final action they're going to
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
recommend um I mean they could decide
 
03:37:24.110 --> 03:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
that everything's fine as it is and you
 
03:37:26.550 --> 03:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
know there'd be um legislation which
 
03:37:28.910 --> 03:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
would basically just get rid of the
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
repeal I mean you know we can't bind a
 
03:37:33.309 --> 03:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
future legislature so if they decide
 
03:37:35.950 --> 03:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
everything's fine with this board then
 
03:37:37.710 --> 03:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
they would just uh submit legislation
 
03:37:40.030 --> 03:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
that would would uh repeal the repeal
 
03:37:44.670 --> 03:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
and everything would stay the same okay
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
um and um if we go down to line 26 you
 
03:37:50.429 --> 03:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
know the commission's analysis may
 
03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
include the laws effects and
 
03:37:54.030 --> 03:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities for workers consumer
 
03:37:56.469 --> 03:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
Choice cost benefits you know General
 
03:37:58.870 --> 03:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment all sorts of other
 
03:38:02.110 --> 03:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
things um and there there's uh that also
 
03:38:04.710 --> 03:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
May doesn't require that they
 
03:38:07.150 --> 03:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
compare um you know other how other
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
states regulate the occupation also
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
looking at you know scope and practice
 
03:38:14.309 --> 03:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
not just what are the requirements um to
 
03:38:15.150 --> 03:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
get a
 
03:38:17.429 --> 03:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
license um you know penalties that are
 
03:38:19.030 --> 03:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
they're imposed for violating it they
 
03:38:21.910 --> 03:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
could look at you know what is the U
 
03:38:24.950 --> 03:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
process for dealing with complaints uh
 
03:38:26.830 --> 03:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
maybe the investigation hearing process
 
03:38:28.150 --> 03:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
I mean they have a wide charge of
 
03:38:32.710 --> 03:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
looking at how um you know the board and
 
03:38:35.070 --> 03:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
and oplc are dealing with regulating
 
03:38:37.870 --> 03:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
that profession um is it being done
 
03:38:39.750 --> 03:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
efficiently is it effectively protecting
 
03:38:41.870 --> 03:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
public health and and safety could it be
 
03:38:46.189 --> 03:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
done better um you know and
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
so it gets into
 
03:38:53.830 --> 03:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
here um on on the page two um line four
 
03:38:55.469 --> 03:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
it starts you know the right of an
 
03:38:57.429 --> 03:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
individual to pursue a lawful occupation
 
03:38:59.710 --> 03:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
a fundamental right where the commission
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
finds it necessary to restrict that
 
03:39:02.710 --> 03:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
right it shall recommend the least
 
03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
restrictive regulation to protect
 
03:39:07.309 --> 03:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
consumers from present significant and
 
03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
substantial harms by providers of the
 
03:39:12.990 --> 03:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
services and it gets into um you know
 
03:39:14.590 --> 03:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
some of the options they can recommend
 
03:39:16.750 --> 03:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
but it it doesn't bind them to just one
 
03:39:19.990 --> 03:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
of these uh but um you know these are
 
03:39:22.830 --> 03:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's just sort of guidance on what they
 
03:39:25.150 --> 03:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
you know should be looking at or
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
considering um and some things that down
 
03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
at line 26 the report shall include its
 
03:39:33.550 --> 03:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
findings and recommendations to the
 
03:39:36.429 --> 03:39:36.439 align:start position:0%
legislature to act leg legislation could
 
03:39:38.550 --> 03:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
repeal the occupational license I would
 
03:39:41.110 --> 03:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
be surprised if that actually you know
 
03:39:42.910 --> 03:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
completely to completely get rid of it
 
03:39:45.309 --> 03:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
and just let the repeal go through could
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
happen but I I'd be very surprised if
 
03:39:49.590 --> 03:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
any of them actually go away you know
 
03:39:50.790 --> 03:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
convert it into one of the less
 
03:39:52.590 --> 03:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
restrictive types of
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
Regulation um and and there's various
 
03:39:56.229 --> 03:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
other options and the last one is just
 
03:39:58.990 --> 03:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
make no change to the law so you know
 
03:40:02.229 --> 03:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
they they're perfectly capable of uh of
 
03:40:05.790 --> 03:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
doing that so the repeals in the repeal
 
03:40:09.070 --> 03:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
section are there to basically Force the
 
03:40:10.550 --> 03:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
commission to do something there's been
 
03:40:12.510 --> 03:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
all too many commissions I've seen and
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we've all seen that are given a
 
03:40:17.910 --> 03:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
charge and they effectively do nothing
 
03:40:19.950 --> 03:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
um some have never met but even ones
 
03:40:21.469 --> 03:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
that meet maybe they generate some kind
 
03:40:26.309 --> 03:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
of report but they don't do anything um
 
03:40:28.269 --> 03:40:28.279 align:start position:0%
you know they don't do what was intended
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
and it's possible that could happen
 
03:40:31.189 --> 03:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
happen here I mean the commission could
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
just recommend everything should stay
 
03:40:35.469 --> 03:40:35.479 align:start position:0%
the same and legislation should be put
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
into repeal the repeal on all of these I
 
03:40:40.269 --> 03:40:40.279 align:start position:0%
hope that's not the case and this is to
 
03:40:43.070 --> 03:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
give a little push to actually take a
 
03:40:46.189 --> 03:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
serious look at at you know how we're
 
03:40:47.870 --> 03:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with all these professions and
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
how we're protecting the public and that
 
03:40:51.550 --> 03:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
is the intent of
 
03:40:54.389 --> 03:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
this um and this by the way is another
 
03:40:58.830 --> 03:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
bill that um you know uh came out of um
 
03:41:00.070 --> 03:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know the governor's office
 
03:41:03.269 --> 03:41:03.279 align:start position:0%
working with oplc and others and I was
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
asked to take it on but this is one
 
03:41:07.150 --> 03:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
where you know I really believe this is
 
03:41:10.469 --> 03:41:10.479 align:start position:0%
a good idea and uh and this you know I I
 
03:41:12.870 --> 03:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
had some had some in a redraft some
 
03:41:15.670 --> 03:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
significant changes mainly to add more
 
03:41:17.469 --> 03:41:17.479 align:start position:0%
guidance to the commission on at least
 
03:41:19.429 --> 03:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
the things they should look at but not
 
03:41:21.790 --> 03:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
demanding they do you know other than
 
03:41:23.870 --> 03:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
they look at it demand that they take
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
any particular action that will be up to
 
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
the commission and um and and on page
 
03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
three at the top it gets into um
 
03:41:35.429 --> 03:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
commission also make comment on each
 
03:41:38.189 --> 03:41:38.199 align:start position:0%
board's licensing board's composition
 
03:41:39.630 --> 03:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
and the authority of the law delegates
 
03:41:41.309 --> 03:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
to prom administrative rules
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
particularly rules relating to
 
03:41:44.750 --> 03:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
establishing you know there's scope of
 
03:41:47.149 --> 03:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
practice and other things so you know
 
03:41:49.550 --> 03:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
they can also look at is the current
 
03:41:52.429 --> 03:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
makeup of the board appropriate is it
 
03:41:54.309 --> 03:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
still the best way of doing things
 
03:41:56.189 --> 03:41:56.199 align:start position:0%
should there be some changes there we've
 
03:41:57.750 --> 03:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
some seen some bills to make those
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
changes but the commission then would be
 
03:42:02.469 --> 03:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
asked to look at it and review that and
 
03:42:05.349 --> 03:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
say okay you know is the membership
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
still the best for overseeing the uh the
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
professions and and protecting the
 
03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:12.630 align:start position:0%
professions and and protecting the
public

03:42:12.630 --> 03:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:42:15.269 --> 03:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
um and then the next part of it starting
 
03:42:18.429 --> 03:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
at line nine on page three are the um
 
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
repeals and so it's done in
 
03:42:24.510 --> 03:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
groups um and that's you know it's just
 
03:42:27.149 --> 03:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
repealing the rsa's related to it but
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
again you know unless the commission
 
03:42:31.630 --> 03:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
does absolutely nothing and nobody puts
 
03:42:35.189 --> 03:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
any legislature legislation to change it
 
03:42:36.950 --> 03:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't see these repeals actually
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
happening but it does put in a process
 
03:42:42.349 --> 03:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to require the commission
 
03:42:45.149 --> 03:42:45.159 align:start position:0%
do something and hopefully hopefully to
 
03:42:47.229 --> 03:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
take a good thorough and effective
 
03:42:49.630 --> 03:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
review of how we're handling you know
 
03:42:51.389 --> 03:42:51.399 align:start position:0%
the regulation of these professions and
 
03:42:52.710 --> 03:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
are we doing it in the best way and
 
03:42:56.790 --> 03:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
should there be any changes made um and
 
03:42:59.110 --> 03:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to go to page uh
 
03:43:01.950 --> 03:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
four uh line 28 starting the effective
 
03:43:06.030 --> 03:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
dates and so that just goes through and
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
it does them um you know it sets the
 
03:43:09.469 --> 03:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
effective dates so they're going to you
 
03:43:11.389 --> 03:43:11.399 align:start position:0%
know when they're going to take effect
 
03:43:13.990 --> 03:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
and it spreads it out from you know 2025
 
03:43:17.070 --> 03:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
is the first uh set and
 
03:43:19.710 --> 03:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
2031 is the LA last and then the
 
03:43:21.309 --> 03:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
remainder of this act takes effect upon
 
03:43:23.149 --> 03:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
passage and that's the establishment of
 
03:43:25.349 --> 03:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
the commission I mean they can start
 
03:43:27.990 --> 03:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
their work as soon as that takes effect
 
03:43:30.830 --> 03:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have to wait um any
 
03:43:33.229 --> 03:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
particular time for any of them but it
 
03:43:33.239 --> 03:43:35.110 align:start position:0%
particular time for any of them but it
does

03:43:35.110 --> 03:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:43:38.030 --> 03:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
um put that into place I mean there is a
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I would like to defer any
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
questions on that to um executive
 
03:43:44.830 --> 03:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
director Courtney who would have the
 
03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
details on that I
 
03:43:50.030 --> 03:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
don't um and that's basically it the key
 
03:43:53.550 --> 03:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
thing I want to I mean I understand why
 
03:43:55.149 --> 03:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
there was some confusion and there are
 
03:43:58.110 --> 03:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
people who felt that the intent here you
 
03:43:59.590 --> 03:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
know the whole goal of the bill is to
 
03:44:01.710 --> 03:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
get rid of Occupational licensing and
 
03:44:03.670 --> 03:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely not the case but I
 
03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
understand why people felt that way uh
 
03:44:07.590 --> 03:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
but it starts out with the establishment
 
03:44:09.550 --> 03:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
of the commission and says they have to
 
03:44:12.189 --> 03:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
start start this work um at least a year
 
03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
prior to any repeal and U and that's all
 
03:44:20.990 --> 03:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:24.670 --> 03:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative BR thank you um
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
there'll also be some follow-up question
 
03:44:30.030 --> 03:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
so in the composition of the
 
03:44:32.389 --> 03:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
commission typically it
 
03:44:35.030 --> 03:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
says um for example when the members of
 
03:44:37.389 --> 03:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
the house when the speaker appoints
 
03:44:40.269 --> 03:44:40.279 align:start position:0%
members it typically mentions either
 
03:44:42.229 --> 03:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
some members from the majority party or
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
some members from the minority party and
 
03:44:46.910 --> 03:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's not here is there a reason for
 
03:44:49.870 --> 03:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
that um the reason is it was drafted
 
03:44:51.870 --> 03:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
that way and then I didn't catch it and
 
03:44:53.550 --> 03:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
I would certainly be glad and I think
 
03:44:56.510 --> 03:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate uh to amend it in that
 
03:44:58.309 --> 03:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
way and and I apologize for the
 
03:45:01.309 --> 03:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
oversight that was not my intent okay
 
03:45:02.830 --> 03:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
follow up follow
 
03:45:07.309 --> 03:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
yeah um it also doesn't um mention
 
03:45:10.349 --> 03:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
members of this committee which are
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
members who for many years have been
 
03:45:14.790 --> 03:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
involved with licensing so I would
 
03:45:17.229 --> 03:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
encourage you to include that as well
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
and again I agree entirely with you and
 
03:45:21.670 --> 03:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
um you know I looked at when I was
 
03:45:23.750 --> 03:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing this um I didn't draft the
 
03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
initial thing when I looked at it for
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
changes again I I didn't um you know I
 
03:45:31.309 --> 03:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
didn't end up taking a close enough look
 
03:45:33.309 --> 03:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
at that section or I probably would have
 
03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
added those changes and thank you for
 
03:45:38.510 --> 03:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
the uh for that that recommendation last
 
03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you than you so in the
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
analysis the bill says the the bill
 
03:45:46.189 --> 03:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
further repeals various occupational
 
03:45:48.830 --> 03:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions each year through
 
03:45:52.830 --> 03:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
2031 where does it say that this is
 
03:45:54.910 --> 03:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
dependent on the commission's finding in
 
03:45:58.070 --> 03:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
this document it um I didn't write the
 
03:46:03.790 --> 03:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
analysis but um it in a sense it's not
 
03:46:05.710 --> 03:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
it is true that if the commission
 
03:46:08.149 --> 03:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
decided never to meet and never to do
 
03:46:11.710 --> 03:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
anything and no but no legislator
 
03:46:14.110 --> 03:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
legislator um seen that introduced a
 
03:46:16.429 --> 03:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
bill to repeal one or more of the
 
03:46:19.870 --> 03:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
repeals I suppose then yes they would
 
03:46:21.870 --> 03:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
get repealed but I cannot imagine that
 
03:46:23.990 --> 03:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
happening I can imagine I suppose the
 
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
commission not doing their job but I
 
03:46:29.389 --> 03:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that if that were the case
 
03:46:31.149 --> 03:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
that nobody would be putting in a bill
 
03:46:32.790 --> 03:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the repeals because you
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
know there would be a human cry over it
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
and um I wouldn't support if the
 
03:46:40.149 --> 03:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
commission was that derel I wouldn't uh
 
03:46:41.870 --> 03:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
support necessarily leaving in all the
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
repeals okay I have another question now
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
one more so if you don't if you don't if
 
03:46:49.710 --> 03:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
you don't support the repeal of these
 
03:46:51.269 --> 03:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
commissions based on the lack of
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
activity from the commission would you
 
03:46:58.269 --> 03:46:58.279 align:start position:0%
not put that in here um no I it's not
 
03:47:00.990 --> 03:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
that I don't support or not support the
 
03:47:03.070 --> 03:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
repeals I mean that would be up to the
 
03:47:04.910 --> 03:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
commission my concern would be if the
 
03:47:06.750 --> 03:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
commission chose never to
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
meet and and make a recommendation you
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
know then I that'd be irresponsible on
 
03:47:13.229 --> 03:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
the people there I hope members would
 
03:47:16.030 --> 03:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
get replaced um but the reason for
 
03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
leaving the repeals in here is to you
 
03:47:21.030 --> 03:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
know provide some impetus to the
 
03:47:21.040 --> 03:47:22.389 align:start position:0%
know provide some impetus to the
commission

03:47:22.389 --> 03:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:47:25.189 --> 03:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
actually um you know doing something and
 
03:47:27.389 --> 03:47:27.399 align:start position:0%
actually taking a look at these and I'm
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
sure there would be plenty of people
 
03:47:31.269 --> 03:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
that would come into the commission to
 
03:47:33.389 --> 03:47:33.399 align:start position:0%
you know make their arguments as both as
 
03:47:36.189 --> 03:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
you know as to why um you know the
 
03:47:38.309 --> 03:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
licensing you know maybe should stay the
 
03:47:41.870 --> 03:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
same but um but also maybe why it should
 
03:47:44.710 --> 03:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
change I um there was going to be
 
03:47:49.349 --> 03:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
someone here um um you know from the uh
 
03:47:50.950 --> 03:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
I can't speak from the pharmac chair
 
03:47:52.389 --> 03:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
actually the chair of the pharmacy board
 
03:47:54.670 --> 03:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
was going to come in and speak yeah a
 
03:47:56.510 --> 03:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
family emergency he said he's going to
 
03:47:58.630 --> 03:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
send in written testimony all I can say
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
is he told me he was actually in support
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
of this but for the details you'll have
 
03:48:07.590 --> 03:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:10.429 --> 03:48:10.439 align:start position:0%
him go again
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry to be so persistent no no
 
03:48:14.469 --> 03:48:14.479 align:start position:0%
you're welcome because you know you are
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
a dear friend from Hudson over there I I
 
03:48:20.429 --> 03:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
do not take these as an attack it's fine
 
03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead but you're sort of talking from
 
03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
both sides of your mouth you're saying
 
03:48:25.550 --> 03:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
the commissions don't do anything and
 
03:48:27.750 --> 03:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we need to do this and then
 
03:48:29.070 --> 03:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying well if the commission
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet then there's nothing to
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
prevent these boards from being repealed
 
03:48:34.670 --> 03:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
so in essence you sort of made your own
 
03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
case have you not I disagree and I I uh
 
03:48:40.269 --> 03:48:40.279 align:start position:0%
take somewhat umbrage at saying I'm
 
03:48:41.590 --> 03:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
talking from both side of my mouth that
 
03:48:44.469 --> 03:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
isn't terribly friendly um it's meant to
 
03:48:46.630 --> 03:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
be friendly okay I tried really hard to
 
03:48:48.590 --> 03:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
find the friendliest words I can find um
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
I strongly disagree with that
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
characterization of what I'm saying um
 
03:48:54.110 --> 03:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:48:58.349 --> 03:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
intended to um light a fire under the
 
03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
commission to take action and um again
 
03:49:03.070 --> 03:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
partly my experience have seen all too
 
03:49:05.229 --> 03:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
many commissions that haven't you know
 
03:49:07.590 --> 03:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
you you if I just created a I had a bill
 
03:49:10.389 --> 03:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
to create a commission to review
 
03:49:13.149 --> 03:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
um all of the um licensing
 
03:49:17.149 --> 03:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
boards um my my expectation is not very
 
03:49:19.510 --> 03:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
high as to what would come out of that
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately and that's based on
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
experience um I mean some commissions
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
have done a great job others less so and
 
03:49:30.590 --> 03:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
um while there's a number of output
 
03:49:31.950 --> 03:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
outcomes that could come out of this as
 
03:49:35.110 --> 03:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
I said um you know I don't expect the
 
03:49:36.910 --> 03:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
end result is going to be repealing all
 
03:49:38.110 --> 03:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
these licensing
 
03:49:42.030 --> 03:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
boards um but you know the reason the
 
03:49:44.110 --> 03:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
language and the repeal is in there and
 
03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
I think is in there even though I don't
 
03:49:48.910 --> 03:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
expect them all to get repealed is
 
03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
because it causes it will cause I hope
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
the commission to take a serious look at
 
03:49:57.550 --> 03:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
these so I again I really don't believe
 
03:49:58.750 --> 03:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
I'm talking out of both sides of my
 
03:50:00.550 --> 03:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
mouth and I strongly object to that
 
03:50:02.710 --> 03:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
characterization and you have my sincere
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:08.239 --> 03:50:10.670 align:start position:0%
 
accepted

03:50:10.670 --> 03:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
03:50:13.149 --> 03:50:13.159 align:start position:0%
representative ghoul thank you Mr chair
 
03:50:14.830 --> 03:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my
 
03:50:17.630 --> 03:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
question I've been watching uh
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan's committee on
 
03:50:23.710 --> 03:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions with interest
 
03:50:27.550 --> 03:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering does this bill have
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
any correlation with the work that
 
03:50:31.750 --> 03:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan's committee is
 
03:50:34.349 --> 03:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
doing on committe not that I'm aware of
 
03:50:38.189 --> 03:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
I have not I mean I'm aware of that uh
 
03:50:40.149 --> 03:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
what he's doing I haven't followed it in
 
03:50:43.710 --> 03:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
detail but I don't I don't see that I
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
mean it does create another
 
03:50:47.870 --> 03:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
commission uh but they have a charge you
 
03:50:49.830 --> 03:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
know over some number of years to do
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
something and and
 
03:50:56.429 --> 03:50:56.439 align:start position:0%
follow thank you for that answer I I as
 
03:50:58.870 --> 03:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
I said I've been following it and
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
clearly there's been some um quite a bit
 
03:51:03.429 --> 03:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
of testimony that's come out that there
 
03:51:05.309 --> 03:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
are a number of committees and
 
03:51:07.389 --> 03:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
commissions that nobody even knows if
 
03:51:09.870 --> 03:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
they meet there's never been any reports
 
03:51:11.070 --> 03:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
coming out of them there's no
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
documentation anything's
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
happening so I'm wondering if that in
 
03:51:17.550 --> 03:51:17.560 align:start position:0%
your work in preparing the bill
 
03:51:19.469 --> 03:51:19.479 align:start position:0%
representative leus did you find that
 
03:51:22.429 --> 03:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
there are any similarities to that
 
03:51:25.189 --> 03:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
scenario among I see that this is
 
03:51:27.070 --> 03:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
limited only to the boards and
 
03:51:29.550 --> 03:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
commissions under um the office of
 
03:51:32.269 --> 03:51:32.279 align:start position:0%
Licensing is that correct or theol
 
03:51:34.710 --> 03:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
licensing um it's the specific ones that
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
are listed in the repeal sect yeah and
 
03:51:38.830 --> 03:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
that's all to do with licensing right so
 
03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it was found that there
 
03:51:43.950 --> 03:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
are instances like that within the
 
03:51:46.830 --> 03:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
listed Boards of there's a question are
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
they even
 
03:51:51.070 --> 03:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
meeting a lack of um knowledge about
 
03:51:53.389 --> 03:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
what they're doing that this bill could
 
03:51:55.149 --> 03:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
be a solution to it would get people's
 
03:51:57.389 --> 03:51:57.399 align:start position:0%
attention to what are they doing I
 
03:51:59.910 --> 03:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
suppose I mean you know it the duty of
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
the commission is to look over you know
 
03:52:06.149 --> 03:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
the both the statute the actual act
 
03:52:07.950 --> 03:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
membership and activity of the board and
 
03:52:11.070 --> 03:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
Associated administrative rules that are
 
03:52:14.149 --> 03:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
um you know that exist for regulation I
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
suppose if they found that the thing
 
03:52:19.229 --> 03:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
ineffective they could decide anything
 
03:52:21.149 --> 03:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
from changing abolish it changing the
 
03:52:23.830 --> 03:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
membership or whatever they recommend I
 
03:52:25.950 --> 03:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
mean it it might be effective to the
 
03:52:27.189 --> 03:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
extent it would it'd have somebody
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
taking a look at it and then reporting
 
03:52:30.830 --> 03:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
on what they're doing I don't know if
 
03:52:32.309 --> 03:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
there actually are existing licensing
 
03:52:36.070 --> 03:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
boards that are in that state but one
 
03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
more thank you Mr chair and um
 
03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so in followup I will say I've
 
03:52:45.670 --> 03:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot as I've talked to my
 
03:52:47.950 --> 03:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
constituents and friends and colleagues
 
03:52:50.429 --> 03:52:50.439 align:start position:0%
about following the committee on
 
03:52:53.389 --> 03:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees um I get a
 
03:52:56.469 --> 03:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
lot of Chuckles about all right yeah and
 
03:52:59.550 --> 03:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
so to here that we're gonna have another
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee on commissions and is we don't
 
03:53:04.670 --> 03:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
even know if that's dob tailing with the
 
03:53:07.710 --> 03:53:07.720 align:start position:0%
existing one makes me
 
03:53:10.950 --> 03:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
wonder if yeah I what I would say is
 
03:53:13.229 --> 03:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
this really is not a
 
03:53:15.710 --> 03:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
general um committee dealing with
 
03:53:18.269 --> 03:53:18.279 align:start position:0%
commissions that it's main it's dealing
 
03:53:20.670 --> 03:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
with um you know the
 
03:53:23.189 --> 03:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
licensing um and also I expect this
 
03:53:26.229 --> 03:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
would become a very high-profile one I'm
 
03:53:27.309 --> 03:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
sure there's going to be a lot of
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
interest in it and I think that makes it
 
03:53:31.550 --> 03:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
less likely that it's going to not meet
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
and not do anything and and also uh kind
 
03:53:36.910 --> 03:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
of a follow up on the question about the
 
03:53:40.149 --> 03:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
repeals um you know
 
03:53:41.870 --> 03:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know worst case the commission
 
03:53:42.990 --> 03:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't do
 
03:53:46.189 --> 03:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
anything um I cannot as I the reason I'm
 
03:53:47.910 --> 03:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
saying I don't see even in that case I
 
03:53:49.590 --> 03:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't see the repeals actually Tak to
 
03:53:51.670 --> 03:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
effect is you know given all the people
 
03:53:53.550 --> 03:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
that are licensed or have an interest in
 
03:53:56.070 --> 03:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
licensing I cannot imagine that you're
 
03:53:58.830 --> 03:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
not going to have somebody get some
 
03:54:00.429 --> 03:54:00.439 align:start position:0%
representative or Senator to put in a
 
03:54:03.030 --> 03:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill to make the repeals not happen if
 
03:54:05.349 --> 03:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
the commissioner were derel in in their
 
03:54:08.389 --> 03:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
Duty I mean that you know there there're
 
03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
probably more things unlikely than that
 
03:54:14.910 --> 03:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:18.149 --> 03:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
view representative man
 
03:54:22.750 --> 03:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
boy thank you um Mr chair thank you for
 
03:54:26.990 --> 03:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question I have couple of qu I
 
03:54:29.790 --> 03:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
have couple of questions one is to start
 
03:54:33.149 --> 03:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
with by setting up a committee
 
03:54:35.429 --> 03:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
commission to study the commission
 
03:54:35.439 --> 03:54:37.870 align:start position:0%
commission to study the commission
statuary

03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
statuary
 
03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:39.389 align:start position:0%
statuary
commissions

03:54:39.389 --> 03:54:39.399 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
03:54:43.910 --> 03:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
within the time frame this body turns
 
03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
over every two years so how do you
 
03:54:49.990 --> 03:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
maintain a a
 
03:54:53.710 --> 03:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
continuity on who's on the committee I
 
03:54:57.910 --> 03:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
mean who's on the commission and what is
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
are you expecting the commission to do
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
their due diligence
 
03:55:05.830 --> 03:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
within the given period the this
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
particular uh session this two years or
 
03:55:12.189 --> 03:55:12.199 align:start position:0%
is it a continuity because the
 
03:55:14.189 --> 03:55:14.199 align:start position:0%
appointment to these commissions can
 
03:55:16.349 --> 03:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
change every two
 
03:55:19.710 --> 03:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
years that that's correct um there I
 
03:55:21.750 --> 03:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
mean the way this is set up their work
 
03:55:26.189 --> 03:55:26.199 align:start position:0%
would continue over um a period of years
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
because it's just impractical it's too
 
03:55:30.030 --> 03:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
much work if they're going to do any
 
03:55:32.429 --> 03:55:32.439 align:start position:0%
kind of reasonable job to do all of them
 
03:55:35.110 --> 03:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
in one twoyear period and that's why you
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
know it's it's staggered when uh the
 
03:55:39.670 --> 03:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
particular um board boards are going to
 
03:55:41.710 --> 03:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
be or have the repeal in
 
03:55:44.510 --> 03:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
place um you know like I mean you can
 
03:55:46.229 --> 03:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
ask the same question about the entire
 
03:55:49.389 --> 03:55:49.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature you have um
 
03:55:52.189 --> 03:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
you know you have a mix of turnover and
 
03:55:53.830 --> 03:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
continuity you have Representatives that
 
03:55:55.469 --> 03:55:55.479 align:start position:0%
are in for quite some time and you have
 
03:55:57.309 --> 03:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
people that are in for one two three
 
03:55:59.510 --> 03:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
terms and I would expect something
 
03:56:01.469 --> 03:56:01.479 align:start position:0%
similar with this
 
03:56:05.630 --> 03:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
um and uh so you know probably you'd
 
03:56:07.149 --> 03:56:07.159 align:start position:0%
have some new people and some people but
 
03:56:09.149 --> 03:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to be dealing probably I
 
03:56:11.189 --> 03:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
mean they could decide to start working
 
03:56:13.790 --> 03:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
early you know some years in advance on
 
03:56:14.910 --> 03:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
one of the ones that's going to get
 
03:56:17.510 --> 03:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
repealed but the way it's set up you
 
03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
know they're going to be working on
 
03:56:22.750 --> 03:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
different professions different
 
03:56:25.550 --> 03:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
boards um you know probably on a yearly
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
basis so they can do things in parallel
 
03:56:28.990 --> 03:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
they can start things
 
03:56:32.830 --> 03:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
early but um it's not like there's they
 
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
don't I mean they're going to have work
 
03:56:36.590 --> 03:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
product regularly because they have to
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
put out a report on the particular
 
03:56:43.070 --> 03:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
boards and professions and you know you
 
03:56:44.670 --> 03:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
whether they're all you know it's always
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
the same people or not I mean you know
 
03:56:47.950 --> 03:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
you can argue whether that's a good
 
03:56:50.389 --> 03:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
thing or a bad thing having some you
 
03:56:52.229 --> 03:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
know people may get burnt out or tired
 
03:56:53.309 --> 03:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
having new people in there is not
 
03:56:55.309 --> 03:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily A Bad Thing keeping some
 
03:56:56.550 --> 03:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
people in there who have experienced
 
03:56:59.229 --> 03:56:59.239 align:start position:0%
doing it it's not a bad thing either uh
 
03:57:00.750 --> 03:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
but same thing with the whole house I
 
03:57:04.349 --> 03:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
mean we have that going on here
 
03:57:09.910 --> 03:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
followup uh a followup yes yeah having
 
03:57:12.110 --> 03:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
serving on the sixth consecutive term
 
03:57:14.389 --> 03:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
and having been on different commissions
 
03:57:18.030 --> 03:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
it changes every two years which
 
03:57:20.950 --> 03:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
commission you get on or not based on
 
03:57:20.960 --> 03:57:23.269 align:start position:0%
commission you get on or not based on
the

03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:57:26.590 --> 03:57:26.600 align:start position:0%
majority the goals that you set today
 
03:57:30.550 --> 03:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
you're trying is this bill trying to set
 
03:57:33.229 --> 03:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
a goal for the future legislation
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
telling this is what you need to do this
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
is 2026 2028 this is what is going to
 
03:57:41.910 --> 03:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
isn't that something that goes totally
 
03:57:45.590 --> 03:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
against what our legislation says we
 
03:57:48.630 --> 03:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
cannot hold the future legislation
 
03:57:50.590 --> 03:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
binding to some of the changes that we
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
are expecting to happen no um it is true
 
03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
that uh one legislature cannot bind a
 
03:57:59.229 --> 03:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
future legislature but if you look at it
 
03:58:00.790 --> 03:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
there there are certainly plenty of
 
03:58:03.229 --> 03:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
bills that are passed that have ongoing
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
effects and if um you know a future
 
03:58:07.950 --> 03:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
legislature decides this whole thing's a
 
03:58:10.269 --> 03:58:10.279 align:start position:0%
bad idea there's nothing that prevents
 
03:58:11.790 --> 03:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
them from repealing the statute
 
03:58:13.429 --> 03:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
including the repe the future repeals
 
03:58:15.229 --> 03:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
that are in it so I'm not you know we're
 
03:58:18.429 --> 03:58:18.439 align:start position:0%
not binding a future legislature we we
 
03:58:20.630 --> 03:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know if we pass this we would be
 
03:58:24.429 --> 03:58:24.439 align:start position:0%
setting a process in in in in effect
 
03:58:26.149 --> 03:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
that at least I would hope would
 
03:58:28.309 --> 03:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
continue forward until completion which
 
03:58:29.870 --> 03:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be across multiple
 
03:58:32.550 --> 03:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
legislatures but you know I'm not we
 
03:58:34.349 --> 03:58:34.359 align:start position:0%
can't bind them we're we're just trying
 
03:58:35.950 --> 03:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
to get something going and provide some
 
03:58:38.149 --> 03:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
direction to the commission and if a
 
03:58:40.030 --> 03:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
future legislature doesn't agree with
 
03:58:49.070 --> 03:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:51.429 --> 03:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
03:58:54.990 --> 03:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:58:55.000 --> 03:58:56.469 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair thank you for
taking

03:58:56.469 --> 03:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
taking
 
03:58:59.389 --> 03:58:59.399 align:start position:0%
questions I'm looking at first I want to
 
03:59:01.710 --> 03:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
go back to what representative gr up GR
 
03:59:03.550 --> 03:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
up uh the makeup of
 
03:59:03.560 --> 03:59:06.750 align:start position:0%
up uh the makeup of
the

03:59:06.750 --> 03:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:10.670 --> 03:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
commission why on line 16 the governor
 
03:59:13.830 --> 03:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
has two positions and then on line 21 he
 
03:59:15.550 --> 03:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
has three more
 
03:59:19.309 --> 03:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
positions he or she as going
 
03:59:23.149 --> 03:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
forward okay um and first of all I mean
 
03:59:24.550 --> 03:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
I've been assured this is going to sub
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
committee and I will gladly accept
 
03:59:28.510 --> 03:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
suggestions for amendments in particular
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:35.630 --> 03:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah I can see the issue there maybe
 
03:59:37.349 --> 03:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
it should be changed I mean the idea was
 
03:59:40.510 --> 03:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
to have a couple of members that kind of
 
03:59:43.030 --> 03:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
represent the governor's View and then
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
have public members but the way things
 
03:59:46.950 --> 03:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
are set up if you look in in other for
 
03:59:49.710 --> 03:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
other boards the public members are are
 
03:59:51.429 --> 03:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh I think they're appointed by the
 
03:59:53.469 --> 03:59:53.479 align:start position:0%
governor if I'm wrong I'd be glad to
 
03:59:56.590 --> 03:59:56.600 align:start position:0%
change this um but I can see the concern
 
03:59:58.910 --> 03:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
that in effect he's appointing um too
 
04:00:01.950 --> 04:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
many people and uh I you know we I can
 
04:00:04.309 --> 04:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
ask director Courtney or look at other
 
04:00:05.670 --> 04:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
statute on
 
04:00:08.710 --> 04:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
how um how the public I mean there
 
04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
they're going to be any of the members I
 
04:00:12.149 --> 04:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
think are generally and this may to be
 
04:00:14.590 --> 04:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
changed if it's not clear in here uh you
 
04:00:17.070 --> 04:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
04:00:19.630 --> 04:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
um they're proposed by somebody but then
 
04:00:21.469 --> 04:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
they're they're basically appointed by
 
04:00:23.550 --> 04:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
the governor and confirmed by counsel
 
04:00:25.389 --> 04:00:25.399 align:start position:0%
and that's true I think for all the
 
04:00:28.550 --> 04:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
boards um but it may be there needs to
 
04:00:31.149 --> 04:00:31.159 align:start position:0%
be um you know the recommendations on
 
04:00:32.950 --> 04:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
them may need to come from somebody else
 
04:00:35.710 --> 04:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's oplc for the public members
 
04:00:37.950 --> 04:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh to come for oplc or whatever I know
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's a problem finding public members
 
04:00:40.630 --> 04:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
actually if you look hopefully in the
 
04:00:43.030 --> 04:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
next calendar representative Gro and I
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
have a memb notice in there asking all
 
04:00:48.630 --> 04:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
representatives to uh who presumably
 
04:00:49.870 --> 04:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
know people in their Community to
 
04:00:51.790 --> 04:00:51.800 align:start position:0%
recruit people uh for being public
 
04:00:54.950 --> 04:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
members for all the boards um but yeah I
 
04:00:56.790 --> 04:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
can see the concern about that and i'
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
certainly probably you know may very
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
well need to be changed thank you
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
followup and going along with the
 
04:01:07.149 --> 04:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
membership of the commission I I just
 
04:01:10.389 --> 04:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:13.469 --> 04:01:13.479 align:start position:0%
left real broad as to who can be
 
04:01:15.070 --> 04:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
appointed there's no specification
 
04:01:16.910 --> 04:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
whether it should be someone who's even
 
04:01:18.870 --> 04:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
licensed by the state of New Hampshire
 
04:01:21.030 --> 04:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
which I think is important to have on a
 
04:01:23.550 --> 04:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
commission like this um to
 
04:01:26.750 --> 04:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
represent I you know the the concern
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
about having um you know representation
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
majority and minority P party I think is
 
04:01:34.149 --> 04:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
important uh maybe specifying that that
 
04:01:35.309 --> 04:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
some of the people have to come for
 
04:01:38.710 --> 04:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
particular committees Edna for example
 
04:01:41.389 --> 04:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
um is important but
 
04:01:44.670 --> 04:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
there I I don't think requiring that
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
they be licensed there's going to I mean
 
04:01:50.830 --> 04:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
licensing the purpose of Licensing in my
 
04:01:53.790 --> 04:01:53.800 align:start position:0%
view is not for the lenses at all the
 
04:01:55.630 --> 04:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of Licensing is to protect
 
04:01:57.870 --> 04:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
public health and safety now certainly
 
04:01:59.189 --> 04:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
the commission's going to have people
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
who have an interest who are licensed
 
04:02:03.309 --> 04:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
before them uh you know providing
 
04:02:06.550 --> 04:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and their reasons for why I
 
04:02:08.349 --> 04:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of it may be that it just say
 
04:02:09.670 --> 04:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
the same but you may I know there's
 
04:02:11.630 --> 04:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to be some coming forward who
 
04:02:13.830 --> 04:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
think there should be changes and you
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
know that's something for the commission
 
04:02:18.189 --> 04:02:18.199 align:start position:0%
to take a look at but I you know I
 
04:02:20.229 --> 04:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't prohibit anybody's license from
 
04:02:23.389 --> 04:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
being on the board at all but I don't I
 
04:02:24.429 --> 04:02:24.439 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be made a
 
04:02:26.429 --> 04:02:26.439 align:start position:0%
requirement either
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
follow would you not agree that many
 
04:02:30.670 --> 04:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
commissions out there have all the
 
04:02:30.680 --> 04:02:32.269 align:start position:0%
commissions out there have all the
stakeholders

04:02:32.269 --> 04:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
04:02:34.149 --> 04:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
involved when you're looking at a
 
04:02:36.269 --> 04:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
particular issue
 
04:02:40.229 --> 04:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
um yes they do and and again
 
04:02:43.750 --> 04:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
um you know while parts of this bill I
 
04:02:44.910 --> 04:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
changed and
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
redraft I I didn't take a careful look
 
04:02:49.750 --> 04:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
at this part this is as it came from the
 
04:02:52.269 --> 04:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
governor's office and and I'm you know
 
04:02:54.670 --> 04:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
seriously open to any kind of
 
04:02:57.790 --> 04:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
suggestions on um you know how the
 
04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
membership should be structured and you
 
04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
know if if you can make the subcommittee
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
mean that be great or not if you could
 
04:03:07.229 --> 04:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
you know send something in and uh you
 
04:03:11.189 --> 04:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
know that I think is a probably the the
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
part of this that that in my view would
 
04:03:16.389 --> 04:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
need the most work and I agree with that
 
04:03:21.389 --> 04:03:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:21.399 --> 04:03:23.309 align:start position:0%
 
follow

04:03:23.309 --> 04:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:03:27.070 --> 04:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
I just have never seen and my question
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
goes to you may be have explained it
 
04:03:34.590 --> 04:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
already but why the repeals are in here
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
all on the surise that we're holding the
 
04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
feet to the fire on a commission to do
 
04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
their work I've never seen a commission
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
formed with something in there to say
 
04:03:47.830 --> 04:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
here do this or else and even if they do
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
something there's nothing to prohibit a
 
04:03:54.309 --> 04:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
repeal and the the the
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh a comparison I would make that it's
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
not a a a commission but it's the whole
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh administrative rules process I mean
 
04:04:06.309 --> 04:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
they expire every 10 years and if the
 
04:04:09.469 --> 04:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
department um does doesn't do anything
 
04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
then they're going to go away right now
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
do go rules go away in Job Lots um I
 
04:04:18.110 --> 04:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't I haven't seen it and it's
 
04:04:19.870 --> 04:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
basically the same sort of thing I mean
 
04:04:22.229 --> 04:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
and again what that the you know the the
 
04:04:23.790 --> 04:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
expiration on the rules is the same
 
04:04:27.830 --> 04:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
thing it requires it it forces a review
 
04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the rules first by the department and
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
then by the legislature at least you
 
04:04:35.189 --> 04:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
know Jael car every at least every 10
 
04:04:37.149 --> 04:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
years and it it's basically the same
 
04:04:37.159 --> 04:04:41.429 align:start position:0%
years and it it's basically the same
idea

04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:49.630 --> 04:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
fa I guess my question is to have the
 
04:04:52.309 --> 04:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
repeals in here now and you're saying
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's the force commission to do
 
04:04:58.590 --> 04:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
something and those in these licensing
 
04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
positions to hold the commission to
 
04:05:03.750 --> 04:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
their feet to the fire to keep these
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
from being
 
04:05:07.229 --> 04:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
repealed goes against why all these
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
folks are here today the hearing is
 
04:05:11.110 --> 04:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
about the repeals in this legislation
 
04:05:13.229 --> 04:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
they're here today not at the commission
 
04:05:15.030 --> 04:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
level they're here today for this
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
correct right I understand that and I
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
understand why people had that view
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
however um let's say you know all the
 
04:05:23.910 --> 04:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
rules oplc rules or rules for a
 
04:05:25.510 --> 04:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
licensing board went away it would in
 
04:05:27.870 --> 04:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
effect almost have the same effect right
 
04:05:30.389 --> 04:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
because most of the licensing details on
 
04:05:32.950 --> 04:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
licensing and how they're granted are
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
are done through you know 541a
 
04:05:36.790 --> 04:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority that's granted it
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
was originally to the boards and now to
 
04:05:40.389 --> 04:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
the you know boards and
 
04:05:44.110 --> 04:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
oplc and I under this is new and I
 
04:05:45.149 --> 04:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
understand why people are concerned
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
about it but they're just as much under
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
threat of their license going away if
 
04:05:51.469 --> 04:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
the rules expired and nobody does
 
04:05:54.710 --> 04:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
anything about it so I I understand the
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
concern and and that's part of why I'm
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
trying to you know up front explain what
 
04:06:01.870 --> 04:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
this is trying to do and what I you know
 
04:06:03.750 --> 04:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
expect the effect is but I think there's
 
04:06:06.349 --> 04:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
just as much a chance of of all the
 
04:06:09.030 --> 04:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
administrative rules on oplc evaporating
 
04:06:11.110 --> 04:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
as there are of of you know the boards
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
evaporating and for similar
 
04:06:17.110 --> 04:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
reasons representative Brown uh thank
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
you chair uh and thank you for taking my
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
question representative leus and since
 
04:06:24.309 --> 04:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
I'm on your subcommittee we'll talk
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
about this some more um but to follow up
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
to fog a dead horse representative groda
 
04:06:30.870 --> 04:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
04:06:34.710 --> 04:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
goalie when I first read this at a dead
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
reading it says these repeals will take
 
04:06:42.070 --> 04:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
place it doesn't say
 
04:06:44.830 --> 04:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
what what you want it to say how's that
 
04:06:47.189 --> 04:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
so I I'm hoping that in the subcommittee
 
04:06:49.630 --> 04:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
that you can you can commit to having a
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
conversation about make making that more
 
04:06:55.149 --> 04:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
clear certainly um I mean in the
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose um in the last
 
04:07:00.830 --> 04:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
sentence it says the purpose of this act
 
04:07:02.830 --> 04:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
is to require the legislature to
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
reexamine the licensing Boards of the
 
04:07:06.870 --> 04:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
state to determine if it is in the best
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
interest of the consumer health and
 
04:07:09.630 --> 04:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
safety of the state to renew their
 
04:07:12.429 --> 04:07:12.439 align:start position:0%
Authority and really you know it's kind
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
of expanded later that could be expanded
 
04:07:17.189 --> 04:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
to renew their Authority um or or make
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
you know changes to it or something like
 
04:07:22.950 --> 04:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
that any any um any changes they they
 
04:07:26.189 --> 04:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
view as necessary and uh you know I'd be
 
04:07:28.349 --> 04:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
glad to add something else in there
 
04:07:32.750 --> 04:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
about you know the purpose is is to um
 
04:07:36.149 --> 04:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
to require this review you know not to
 
04:07:38.590 --> 04:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
just get rid of the board WS or some
 
04:07:40.109 --> 04:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
language like that I mean I'd be
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy to add that if it's
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
going to make people more comfortable
 
04:07:43.080 --> 04:07:47.670 align:start position:0%
going to make people more comfortable
with

04:07:47.670 --> 04:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:51.389 --> 04:07:51.399 align:start position:0%
this go ahead representative groda I I
 
04:07:53.309 --> 04:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
do want to address this comparison to
 
04:07:56.670 --> 04:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
rules and I have members of the members
 
04:07:58.990 --> 04:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
of this committee who have been on Jael
 
04:08:02.189 --> 04:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
car as I am now but I can tell you that
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
rules do expire however during that
 
04:08:06.389 --> 04:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
process they can be conditionally
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
approved they can be we adopted there is
 
04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for them to continue so I
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
04:08:16.750 --> 04:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
that um it's and that mechanism doesn't
 
04:08:18.309 --> 04:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
exist here you can't just like get rid
 
04:08:19.950 --> 04:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
of Licensing and then six months later
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
decide oh well we want it back do you
 
04:08:24.149 --> 04:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
understand does that analogy makes sense
 
04:08:27.229 --> 04:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
you I understand um you know there is
 
04:08:28.830 --> 04:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
nothing to
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
prevent uh either the commission to
 
04:08:32.910 --> 04:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation or any legislator
 
04:08:37.590 --> 04:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know a rep or a senator to um to put
 
04:08:40.389 --> 04:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
put in a bill to to repeal the repeal or
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
any particular one if they think I mean
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
if the commission thinks they need more
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
time and they want to change when the
 
04:08:46.910 --> 04:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
repeal is going to occur or get rid of
 
04:08:49.229 --> 04:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
it you the legislature is perfectly
 
04:08:53.590 --> 04:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
capable of doing that um or um you know
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
again as I said if they're not doing
 
04:08:57.030 --> 04:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
their job the say any legislature can
 
04:08:59.229 --> 04:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
put in a bill and and you know if it's
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
going to be something crazy like you
 
04:09:03.269 --> 04:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
know you get you're going to repeal the
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine or something I don't
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
think there's going to be a problem
 
04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
either having somebody put bill in or
 
04:09:11.349 --> 04:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
getting it passed right I mean it's uh
 
04:09:12.910 --> 04:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
that I see consent calendar in its
 
04:09:17.070 --> 04:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
future if um either the board isn't
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
doing its job or maybe the board decides
 
04:09:21.109 --> 04:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
they need more time there's no no reason
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
why they can't delay it or remove that
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
repeal um I agree it's not automatic but
 
04:09:27.750 --> 04:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
in effect it's going to be kind of
 
04:09:29.550 --> 04:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
automatic because this then this is
 
04:09:30.910 --> 04:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
going to be more visible than a
 
04:09:33.070 --> 04:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
particular rule expiring probably in
 
04:09:34.950 --> 04:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
most cases
 
04:09:40.590 --> 04:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.990 --> 04:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
oh never mind no more questions and oh
 
04:09:45.000 --> 04:09:46.269 align:start position:0%
oh never mind no more questions and oh
was

04:09:46.269 --> 04:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:09:48.950 --> 04:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
thatou thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative leus once
 
04:09:53.910 --> 04:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
again as the conversation has gone on
 
04:09:54.990 --> 04:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
kind of building off some of the
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
previous questions I recall I don't
 
04:10:00.309 --> 04:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
recall us as a committee forming a
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
commission or having a bill to form a
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
commission before us last year but 10
 
04:10:07.550 --> 04:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
years ago when the commission on Native
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
Affairs was formed I was heavily
 
04:10:11.309 --> 04:10:11.319 align:start position:0%
involved in that and it was part of the
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
language of that commission that it
 
04:10:15.910 --> 04:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
would sunset at the end of five years so
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
when the Sunset date came it was
 
04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon us to put a bill in to
 
04:10:25.269 --> 04:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
continue it and it did successfully be
 
04:10:27.189 --> 04:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
continued it was a good opportunity to
 
04:10:29.469 --> 04:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
make some changes we removed the
 
04:10:31.469 --> 04:10:31.479 align:start position:0%
genealogist position I was the
 
04:10:33.950 --> 04:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
genealogist and I wanted to be removed
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
and I supported the position being
 
04:10:38.149 --> 04:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
removed so it my point being it gave a
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
good opportunity for a review and some
 
04:10:44.349 --> 04:10:44.359 align:start position:0%
revisions and then by removing the
 
04:10:47.469 --> 04:10:47.479 align:start position:0%
sunset Clause it was like it took away a
 
04:10:47.479 --> 04:10:48.870 align:start position:0%
sunset Clause it was like it took away a
known

04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
known
 
04:10:51.870 --> 04:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
review and um and things changed the
 
04:10:53.550 --> 04:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of the board did change and not
 
04:10:56.349 --> 04:10:56.359 align:start position:0%
for the better Quorum got harder things
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
just got tougher for the commission so
 
04:11:02.149 --> 04:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
my question is is this isn't this the
 
04:11:04.590 --> 04:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
same language that we saw standard in
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
the commission on Native Affairs and
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
most commissions that were form Med and
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
has that changed I I'm not familiar with
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
the exact language on that uh but to
 
04:11:13.560 --> 04:11:14.790 align:start position:0%
the exact language on that uh but to
your

04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:11:16.990 --> 04:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
concern I mean there there is a valid
 
04:11:19.109 --> 04:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
concern there I wasn't worried about it
 
04:11:22.750 --> 04:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
which maybe was a u oversight on my part
 
04:11:25.710 --> 04:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
um because the repeals sort of Drive the
 
04:11:27.309 --> 04:11:27.319 align:start position:0%
work of the commission and they happen
 
04:11:30.309 --> 04:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
at certain dates and so the last one
 
04:11:34.189 --> 04:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
being on July 1st of 2031 and in effect
 
04:11:36.189 --> 04:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
at least the way I was thinking about it
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
is the work of the commission
 
04:11:40.469 --> 04:11:40.479 align:start position:0%
would be done at that point but you're
 
04:11:42.910 --> 04:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
correct there isn't an explicit sunset
 
04:11:45.030 --> 04:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
on the commission and I'd be glad to add
 
04:11:47.109 --> 04:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
that that's actually you know a good
 
04:11:49.630 --> 04:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
idea um it would Sunset the sunset
 
04:11:52.149 --> 04:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
commission exactly so which I'm fine on
 
04:11:54.309 --> 04:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
or the legislature could decide they
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
want it to continue and maybe you know
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
at some interval in the future uh you
 
04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
know go basically through it again or
 
04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
whatever would be up to the leg I don't
 
04:12:03.870 --> 04:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
expect to be in the legislature at that
 
04:12:07.109 --> 04:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
time it' be up to them and uh and and
 
04:12:10.469 --> 04:12:10.479 align:start position:0%
but but you know there wouldn't be this
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
push for the commission to do anything
 
04:12:15.269 --> 04:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
after that date uh because nothing else
 
04:12:17.149 --> 04:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
is going to be sunsetting you know
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
nothing else going to be repealed and if
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
they you know I suppose if we don't put
 
04:12:22.070 --> 04:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
a repeal in they could keep meeting if
 
04:12:24.149 --> 04:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
they want and talk about what they think
 
04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the boards and suggest legislation
 
04:12:28.630 --> 04:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
but at least the core of their purpose
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
would be done and adding a sunset on
 
04:12:32.910 --> 04:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
that date or you know would probably be
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.239 --> 04:12:39.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:12:39.790 --> 04:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:39.800 --> 04:12:41.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:12:41.670 --> 04:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:12:46.349 --> 04:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you Mr chair um I am looking
 
04:12:49.550 --> 04:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
oh dear I just lost it again hang on I'm
 
04:12:52.670 --> 04:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
looking at um chapter
 
04:12:56.830 --> 04:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
219 of 2022 that was established by
 
04:12:59.590 --> 04:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 330 bill that came to this
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
committee what what was that again
 
04:13:04.710 --> 04:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me Senate Bill 330 and this
 
04:13:08.189 --> 04:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
chapter chapter 219 thank you that's the
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
chapter law that established a committee
 
04:13:13.349 --> 04:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
to study and make
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations relative to the office
 
04:13:18.070 --> 04:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
of professional lure and
 
04:13:20.349 --> 04:13:20.359 align:start position:0%
certification and The Lure of
 
04:13:24.630 --> 04:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
professions under boards councils and
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
commissions uh what's wrong with having
 
04:13:30.469 --> 04:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
that committee do the work that you're
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
talking about so
 
04:13:35.670 --> 04:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
um I apologize when when was that formed
 
04:13:39.229 --> 04:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
and 2022 okay and did they H you know in
 
04:13:40.830 --> 04:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
that bill were they supposed to come up
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
with a report at some point and if they
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
were did they um well I'm not sure but
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
it could I have not read further down
 
04:13:49.109 --> 04:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure there is some sort of
 
04:13:51.550 --> 04:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
report that they're supposed to put out
 
04:13:55.469 --> 04:13:55.479 align:start position:0%
but regardless that committee exists and
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like it could do the work that
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
you want why not just amend that chapter
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
and well if you we could we could do I
 
04:14:07.590 --> 04:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
mean what they don't have
 
04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
is um two things one at least I don't
 
04:14:11.790 --> 04:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
believe I haven't read it I mean I'm I'm
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
pretty sure they don't have the repeals
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
to push them to actually do something by
 
04:14:16.479 --> 04:14:17.429 align:start position:0%
to push them to actually do something by
certain

04:14:17.429 --> 04:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
certain
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
dates and um and there's some details in
 
04:14:22.950 --> 04:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
here on the duties and kind of Direction
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
which I suspect is not in that one so I
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
I agree there there it sounds like
 
04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's some duplication it' be
 
04:14:31.469 --> 04:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
interesting to look at what if anything
 
04:14:33.149 --> 04:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
that commission has
 
04:14:36.670 --> 04:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
done and I mean to avoid duplication
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
either suppose that one could be
 
04:14:41.149 --> 04:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
repealed or that one could be amended to
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
do what this is or you know I'd be open
 
04:14:46.710 --> 04:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
to any of that but but I think you know
 
04:14:51.030 --> 04:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
having some um Direction on how to do
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
the review not some again that may may
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
some of that may be in there I don't
 
04:14:56.710 --> 04:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
know but not some general charge to kind
 
04:14:59.109 --> 04:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
of look at it which I don't think tends
 
04:15:02.189 --> 04:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
to be all that effective and then uh
 
04:15:03.630 --> 04:15:03.640 align:start position:0%
then I think the repeals are a key part
 
04:15:05.149 --> 04:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
of this to actually make sure we or make
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
it much more likely we'll get a a result
 
04:15:08.910 --> 04:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
out of
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
you I believe that was everybody uh
 
04:15:19.710 --> 04:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:24.149 --> 04:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:27.070 --> 04:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
Courtney oh representative leus if you
 
04:15:28.670 --> 04:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
could fill out a pink card the clerk
 
04:15:30.269 --> 04:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
would love
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:36.000 --> 04:15:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:15:40.349 --> 04:15:40.359 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Lindsay Courtney
 
04:15:41.550 --> 04:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
executive director office of
 
04:15:43.109 --> 04:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
professional lice Insurance
 
04:15:45.109 --> 04:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
certification uh the office is not
 
04:15:46.510 --> 04:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill but I
 
04:15:48.670 --> 04:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to um make myself available to
 
04:15:50.429 --> 04:15:50.439 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
04:15:53.109 --> 04:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
regarding how we would implement this um
 
04:15:55.630 --> 04:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
and also to offer a few
 
04:15:58.590 --> 04:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
observations um as to what's going on in
 
04:16:01.870 --> 04:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
the field of Occupational regulation
 
04:16:04.590 --> 04:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
Nationwide um but before I get into that
 
04:16:06.510 --> 04:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative Shu I wanted to answer
 
04:16:08.149 --> 04:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
your pre question regarding the
 
04:16:10.590 --> 04:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
committee established by Senate Bill 330
 
04:16:14.510 --> 04:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
they are um no longer active um they did
 
04:16:16.070 --> 04:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
have a very
 
04:16:19.790 --> 04:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
productive um fall that year um they had
 
04:16:22.389 --> 04:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
a series of meetings many stakeholders
 
04:16:24.510 --> 04:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
attended they issued a report and the
 
04:16:27.750 --> 04:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
report essentially became the Genesis
 
04:16:29.870 --> 04:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
for several pieces of legislation last
 
04:16:31.229 --> 04:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
year which was
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
655 uh which turned into 409 as well as
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
337 and some other pieces of legislation
 
04:16:36.600 --> 04:16:37.510 align:start position:0%
337 and some other pieces of legislation
so

04:16:37.510 --> 04:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:40.510 --> 04:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to to to answer that
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
question um but I guess what I would
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
offer on the idea of sunsetting it's we
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
are seeing that this is an
 
04:16:47.279 --> 04:16:48.990 align:start position:0%
are seeing that this is an
increasingly

04:16:48.990 --> 04:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
increasingly
 
04:16:53.790 --> 04:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
um uh popular if you will um approach to
 
04:16:56.149 --> 04:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
um ensuring that the legislature is
 
04:16:57.790 --> 04:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
consistently reviewing statutes
 
04:17:01.030 --> 04:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
regarding occupational uh regulation I
 
04:17:03.510 --> 04:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
think in many states um it takes the
 
04:17:05.389 --> 04:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
same approach that is proposed by this
 
04:17:08.590 --> 04:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
bill which is essentially to have um a
 
04:17:11.149 --> 04:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
self-imposed accountability system
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
whereby you know the statutes are
 
04:17:15.550 --> 04:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
prospectively repealed and it forces the
 
04:17:18.910 --> 04:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
legislature to file a bill at some point
 
04:17:21.269 --> 04:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
like something has to be filed in for in
 
04:17:25.149 --> 04:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
order for um for the practice acts to
 
04:17:27.070 --> 04:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
continue another approach that we've
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
seen Nationwide is what um others have
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
suggested on this committee which is
 
04:17:35.550 --> 04:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
just a a commission um you know from a
 
04:17:37.109 --> 04:17:37.119 align:start position:0%
policy standpoint that's certainly
 
04:17:39.429 --> 04:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
another way to approach it um the
 
04:17:42.309 --> 04:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
difference being that um legislation
 
04:17:44.349 --> 04:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
does not have to be filed so I think the
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
question for this committee is to really
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
consider you know do you want um you
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
know do you want that that sort of
 
04:17:54.349 --> 04:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
accountability structure um regarding
 
04:17:57.550 --> 04:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note I would say that um
 
04:17:59.149 --> 04:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
essentially what we did to calculate
 
04:18:01.990 --> 04:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
that is we took whatever the revenue is
 
04:18:04.710 --> 04:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
that uh these boards uh generally
 
04:18:08.950 --> 04:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
generate um and we just uh we just
 
04:18:12.149 --> 04:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
projected that as a loss if if the um
 
04:18:15.109 --> 04:18:15.119 align:start position:0%
boards were to be repealed um on the
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
expenditure side uh same thing um we
 
04:18:22.429 --> 04:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
just projected that um as a a cost
 
04:18:24.229 --> 04:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
savings measure so I'm happy to answer
 
04:18:26.550 --> 04:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
any questions but that's generally um
 
04:18:30.389 --> 04:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:33.070 --> 04:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
that which in order of which I saw them
 
04:18:36.070 --> 04:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative goalie goes thank you Mr
 
04:18:36.080 --> 04:18:37.429 align:start position:0%
representative goalie goes thank you Mr
chair

04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:18:38.830 --> 04:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank you director for taking my
 
04:18:38.840 --> 04:18:41.070 align:start position:0%
thank you director for taking my
question

04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:18:43.710 --> 04:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
certainly when you talk
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
about the sunset provisions and seeing
 
04:18:48.070 --> 04:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
them that's not going on here in New
 
04:18:49.469 --> 04:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently correct is that
 
04:18:50.990 --> 04:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
other states you're talking no correct
 
04:18:53.710 --> 04:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
that's n that's a nationwide approach
 
04:18:57.750 --> 04:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know we see that popping up um as
 
04:19:00.229 --> 04:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
there is a um increasing scrutiny as it
 
04:19:02.469 --> 04:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
relates to occupational licensing and
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
how it impacts Workforce and so many
 
04:19:07.229 --> 04:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
states have responded by in that they're
 
04:19:13.469 --> 04:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:17.590 --> 04:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
statutes so
 
04:19:21.189 --> 04:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
well I don't take lightly the fact that
 
04:19:22.710 --> 04:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
we don't follow up looking at our
 
04:19:25.109 --> 04:19:25.119 align:start position:0%
statutes because being here on adna for
 
04:19:29.790 --> 04:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
a number of years I think this committee
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
sees a lot of Licensing bills and are
 
04:19:35.790 --> 04:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
pretty well in tune to what's going on
 
04:19:37.990 --> 04:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
over in your office and with
 
04:19:38.000 --> 04:19:40.189 align:start position:0%
over in your office and with
licensing

04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
04:19:42.990 --> 04:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
um so while you say to hold the feet to
 
04:19:46.670 --> 04:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
legislature would you not agree that I
 
04:19:51.550 --> 04:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
think this committee is pretty well in
 
04:19:53.670 --> 04:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
tuned as to what's going on in your
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
office and throughout the state
 
04:19:56.000 --> 04:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
office and throughout the state
in

04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
licensing yes I don't agree I I don't
 
04:20:01.830 --> 04:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
disagree with that at all I would I
 
04:20:04.149 --> 04:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
would say I feel like I live here six
 
04:20:07.109 --> 04:20:07.119 align:start position:0%
months in the year as well but um but
 
04:20:09.229 --> 04:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm not taking a position as to what
 
04:20:12.189 --> 04:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
approach is the better approach I'm just
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
explaining that these are different
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
approaches that other states have taken
 
04:20:18.109 --> 04:20:18.119 align:start position:0%
depending on you know the policy
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
decision of what you would like to see
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I I would say Mr chair that we
 
04:20:25.389 --> 04:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
don't need legislation to hold our feet
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
to the fire I think we do our job here
 
04:20:28.469 --> 04:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:20:32.269 --> 04:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
committee thank representative manui oh
 
04:20:34.950 --> 04:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
oh you next okay sorry that's okay how
 
04:20:38.590 --> 04:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
do you see the um one of the results of
 
04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
that Senate bill was not only this
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
commission but the oplc oversight
 
04:20:46.950 --> 04:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
committee so how do you see that working
 
04:20:48.910 --> 04:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me isn't that also a source of
 
04:20:50.590 --> 04:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
future legislation as
 
04:20:53.790 --> 04:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
well yes absolutely that is something
 
04:20:56.309 --> 04:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
that I think you know we've only had two
 
04:20:59.710 --> 04:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
meeting one two uh meetings um so far
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
but certainly that could provide a
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
source of of future
 
04:21:05.439 --> 04:21:09.870 align:start position:0%
source of of future
legislation

04:21:09.870 --> 04:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
representative manuti thank you Mr chair
 
04:21:15.389 --> 04:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I have
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
two part question one
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
is you know New Hampshire has the
 
04:21:24.149 --> 04:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
largest body of volunteer legislation
 
04:21:26.750 --> 04:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
holding a volunteer legislation feet to
 
04:21:28.590 --> 04:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
the fire I don't know where you're going
 
04:21:29.389 --> 04:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
to get
 
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
it can't hear you over
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
here thank
 
04:21:36.630 --> 04:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
you I said New Hampshire has one one of
 
04:21:40.070 --> 04:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
the large volunteer legislation holding
 
04:21:43.269 --> 04:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
volunteer legislation feet to the fire I
 
04:21:45.870 --> 04:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how far we can get at the
 
04:21:51.550 --> 04:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
same time isn't this kind of holding the
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
future legislation accountable you got
 
04:21:59.229 --> 04:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
to do something by setting other
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
states none of the other states have the
 
04:22:05.630 --> 04:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
legisl legislation like we have the
 
04:22:08.109 --> 04:22:08.119 align:start position:0%
large body of
 
04:22:08.119 --> 04:22:10.070 align:start position:0%
large body of
legislators

04:22:10.070 --> 04:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
04:22:12.389 --> 04:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
correct I I don't know that I would
 
04:22:13.710 --> 04:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
agree with that I think it's pretty
 
04:22:16.030 --> 04:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
common to see legally right to see
 
04:22:19.149 --> 04:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
perspective repeals um and at any given
 
04:22:21.309 --> 04:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
time the legislature has the authority
 
04:22:23.149 --> 04:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
to make a decision to eliminate that
 
04:22:25.710 --> 04:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
perspective repeal so I don't
 
04:22:28.229 --> 04:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh agree with that I would
 
04:22:31.149 --> 04:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
also say again not taking a position
 
04:22:33.309 --> 04:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
that the flip side of of that statement
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
is that because there's about 400 of you
 
04:22:37.750 --> 04:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
all it takes is somebody in a grocery
 
04:22:39.070 --> 04:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
store to run into a representative to
 
04:22:40.469 --> 04:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
say hey this is a problem and a Bill
 
04:22:42.550 --> 04:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
gets filed so one could make the
 
04:22:45.070 --> 04:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
argument that um it's actually easier
 
04:22:49.790 --> 04:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
and there's easier access to um to uh to
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
our Civic um you know system here um
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
than other states and I would agree with
 
04:22:54.640 --> 04:22:55.429 align:start position:0%
than other states and I would agree with
that

04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:22:58.469 --> 04:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
so so I guess those would be my comments
 
04:23:00.870 --> 04:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
I I mean I Echo represented LA's
 
04:23:03.030 --> 04:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
comments I mean I don't see any of these
 
04:23:06.030 --> 04:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
boards being repealed practically um
 
04:23:07.790 --> 04:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
which is probably why I didn't have the
 
04:23:09.990 --> 04:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
same reaction that some of our our other
 
04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
constituents had um you know and then
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
there's multiple ways to approach the
 
04:23:20.750 --> 04:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:24.269 --> 04:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
noted representative G thank you Mr
 
04:23:25.590 --> 04:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you director for taking
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
my question uh as I asked representative
 
04:23:31.149 --> 04:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
leus are you aware whether
 
04:23:34.109 --> 04:23:34.119 align:start position:0%
representative Tom Dolan's committee on
 
04:23:36.630 --> 04:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
studying committees and commissions is
 
04:23:40.109 --> 04:23:40.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the same um committee boards
 
04:23:43.469 --> 04:23:43.479 align:start position:0%
and commissions that are on this list my
 
04:23:45.109 --> 04:23:45.119 align:start position:0%
understanding of that is that that is
 
04:23:47.830 --> 04:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
for legislative commissions I could be
 
04:23:50.109 --> 04:23:50.119 align:start position:0%
wrong um but these are these are
 
04:23:51.429 --> 04:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
different types of commissions because
 
04:23:52.790 --> 04:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
they they fall within the executive
 
04:23:59.229 --> 04:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:00.950 --> 04:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you very time thank you
 
04:24:00.960 --> 04:24:02.510 align:start position:0%
you thank you very time thank you
director

04:24:02.510 --> 04:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
director
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:30.429 --> 04:24:30.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
04:24:33.149 --> 04:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Carol Maguire representing
 
04:24:36.149 --> 04:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
marac District 27 the towns of
 
04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
Allenstown Dunbarton Epsom and hookit
 
04:24:42.429 --> 04:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to present
 
04:24:46.229 --> 04:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
a more of a broader view of this
 
04:24:50.229 --> 04:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:54.229 --> 04:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
create so many structures and then we go
 
04:24:56.910 --> 04:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
on and we wrote and there's a lot of
 
04:24:59.670 --> 04:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
turnover we end up with a lot of
 
04:25:03.910 --> 04:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
artifacts in our statutes and our
 
04:25:07.630 --> 04:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
organizations for example we have I
 
04:25:10.950 --> 04:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
don't know how many dedicated funds and
 
04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
there is a standing committee that meets
 
04:25:18.510 --> 04:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
and reviews a quarter of them every year
 
04:25:21.189 --> 04:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
to say do we still need this is it still
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
active can we fix it is there a problem
 
04:25:27.309 --> 04:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
and they and they look at
 
04:25:30.990 --> 04:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
every dedicated fund every four
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
years sometimes in more intensity than
 
04:25:39.030 --> 04:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
others we can combine these or whatever
 
04:25:43.550 --> 04:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
so and the we have oversight committees
 
04:25:46.830 --> 04:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
we have legislative standing
 
04:25:49.710 --> 04:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
committees but we end up with a lot of
 
04:25:54.229 --> 04:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
stuff that gets put into law that is not
 
04:25:58.030 --> 04:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
looked at for a long time U and with all
 
04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
due respect to representative goal yes
 
04:26:03.349 --> 04:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
we do look at it when somebody brings it
 
04:26:06.189 --> 04:26:06.199 align:start position:0%
to our attention if somebody brings in a
 
04:26:09.710 --> 04:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
bill on a type of license we look at it
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
we examine it we fix it but there are
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
other professions that don't have issues
 
04:26:17.550 --> 04:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
and they don't come to us or we don't
 
04:26:17.560 --> 04:26:18.590 align:start position:0%
and they don't come to us or we don't
have

04:26:18.590 --> 04:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:26:21.309 --> 04:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
bills and we don't know anything we
 
04:26:23.309 --> 04:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
don't look into whether we need it
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
whether it's appropriate we we're very
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
reactive this commission is set up to
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
look at it whether it's working or not
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
and say yes the board of account
 
04:26:38.349 --> 04:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
understands what their rules are we need
 
04:26:41.030 --> 04:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
to have this they're
 
04:26:43.710 --> 04:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
good and and look at the next one in the
 
04:26:46.109 --> 04:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
list and say yes we have we have a
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
question about how we license our body
 
04:26:52.590 --> 04:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
artists for example and
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
so we this commission would would on a
 
04:27:00.109 --> 04:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
structured basis look at all of the
 
04:27:02.189 --> 04:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
professions that have been licensed for
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
one reason or another for more than the
 
04:27:09.030 --> 04:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
past years and say yes we did it right
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
or well maybe we can make it a little
 
04:27:11.199 --> 04:27:12.189 align:start position:0%
or well maybe we can make it a little
bit

04:27:12.189 --> 04:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
bit
 
04:27:15.990 --> 04:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
better and based on the experience of
 
04:27:18.189 --> 04:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
having been on a committee on
 
04:27:22.269 --> 04:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
committees um 10 year sorry 15 years ago
 
04:27:24.910 --> 04:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
you know you look at them and there are
 
04:27:27.550 --> 04:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
some that were started with great
 
04:27:30.070 --> 04:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm and went on for a year or two
 
04:27:33.790 --> 04:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
or three and then they faded out nobody
 
04:27:36.910 --> 04:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
nobody paid any attention to them and so
 
04:27:38.950 --> 04:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
every 10 years or so we have a committee
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
on committees to go through and look for
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
them the dedicated funds gets looked
 
04:27:47.870 --> 04:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
at like every four years because there's
 
04:27:50.990 --> 04:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
so many of them and we need to do that
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
because we keep accumulating all this
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
house all this stuff and we need to keep
 
04:27:59.950 --> 04:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
track of it and clean house um
 
04:28:03.790 --> 04:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
so whether or not you think that all of
 
04:28:06.670 --> 04:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
our licensing statutes are
 
04:28:08.950 --> 04:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
perfectly correct as they are today
 
04:28:12.269 --> 04:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
which may be your position or whether
 
04:28:16.030 --> 04:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
you think they're all wrong it still
 
04:28:18.550 --> 04:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter whether you think they
 
04:28:21.910 --> 04:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
should be looked at and verified on a
 
04:28:24.630 --> 04:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
regular basis by somebody that is doing
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:32.309 --> 04:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
fashion representative Shu I'm sorry
 
04:28:35.630 --> 04:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
yeah no I'm representative hi I'm sorry
 
04:28:40.990 --> 04:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
I'm represent gr right that's okay so um
 
04:28:43.469 --> 04:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire it's not that we
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
is not that I can speak for myself I
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
agree with you I understand but it is
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
the resistance I'm I'm a pretty good
 
04:28:54.070 --> 04:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
reader and I can comprehend pretty well
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
and many of us have comprehended this
 
04:28:59.309 --> 04:28:59.319 align:start position:0%
bill in the same way as the analysis
 
04:29:02.269 --> 04:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
which we're not really talking about
 
04:29:04.469 --> 04:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
reviewing we're talking about we're
 
04:29:07.070 --> 04:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
concerned with the repeat healing part
 
04:29:09.990 --> 04:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
so if if it were just merely and I've
 
04:29:12.309 --> 04:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned this and well I've I've
 
04:29:14.189 --> 04:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
received a lot of resistance to changing
 
04:29:16.830 --> 04:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
any of that so if there's some some sort
 
04:29:18.750 --> 04:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
of compromise that we can make where
 
04:29:20.670 --> 04:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the reviewing of
 
04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
these things there is no doubt in my
 
04:29:23.950 --> 04:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
mind that there could be improvements
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
made if we review but if a gun is put to
 
04:29:28.790 --> 04:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
my head and I have to I've got so many
 
04:29:30.590 --> 04:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
times so much time to look at it or it's
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
going to repeal that's a completely
 
04:29:37.590 --> 04:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
different message would you agree um
 
04:29:39.710 --> 04:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
I don't actually see it that way myself
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
but I can see where you might
 
04:29:44.670 --> 04:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
and um that's one of the reasons it's
 
04:29:46.990 --> 04:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee to see how to
 
04:29:50.349 --> 04:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
implement the goal of this bill without
 
04:29:53.590 --> 04:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh causing so these concerns thank you
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
so much I appreciate
 
04:29:58.670 --> 04:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
04:30:02.550 --> 04:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:05.870 --> 04:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
sorry represent Maguire you've been
 
04:30:08.590 --> 04:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
around here as long as I have and looked
 
04:30:11.429 --> 04:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
at the makeup of this committee
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
and how often it has changed with new
 
04:30:19.229 --> 04:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:25.870 --> 04:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:28.670 --> 04:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
house and when I look
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
at the makeup of this commission and the
 
04:30:34.189 --> 04:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
together I can
 
04:30:40.429 --> 04:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
see where this commission starts going
 
04:30:40.439 --> 04:30:41.910 align:start position:0%
see where this commission starts going
One

04:30:41.910 --> 04:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
One
 
04:30:44.349 --> 04:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
Direction there's a change in a corner
 
04:30:46.030 --> 04:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
office or a change in the senate or a
 
04:30:48.389 --> 04:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
change in the house the members change
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
and all the work that was just done is
 
04:30:54.269 --> 04:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:54.279 --> 04:30:55.870 align:start position:0%
 
way

04:30:55.870 --> 04:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:31:00.670 --> 04:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
and in all fairness to say the repeal of
 
04:31:03.149 --> 04:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
Licensing is tied to a commission
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
getting its work done when we here at
 
04:31:08.429 --> 04:31:08.439 align:start position:0%
the legislature really have no control
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
of the members of that commission four
 
04:31:12.750 --> 04:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
years from
 
04:31:16.590 --> 04:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
now that's the issue I have do you not
 
04:31:18.070 --> 04:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
agree that that could
 
04:31:20.590 --> 04:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
happen I agree that the membership of
 
04:31:23.070 --> 04:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
the commission could change with a
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
change in the governor or a change in
 
04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
the structure of the house I mean that
 
04:31:29.630 --> 04:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
that it's happened half a dozen times
 
04:31:32.510 --> 04:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
since I've been here but
 
04:31:35.870 --> 04:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
the the analysis that the commission
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
does even if it's slanted to some degree
 
04:31:42.750 --> 04:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
would still be useful and it would still
 
04:31:47.389 --> 04:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
re and it would um and as far as the
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
repeal goes that's something that I
 
04:31:51.950 --> 04:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
think we need that the subcommittee
 
04:31:56.750 --> 04:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:00.389 --> 04:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
at representative man maputi thank you
 
04:32:02.910 --> 04:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative for
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
04:32:04.479 --> 04:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
taking my
question

04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:32:08.229 --> 04:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
I look at this as
 
04:32:13.229 --> 04:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
a holding the body the commission pun
 
04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
very punitive angle is that because if
 
04:32:19.469 --> 04:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
you don't do this this is what's going
 
04:32:23.910 --> 04:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
to happen so is it fair to say that we
 
04:32:26.590 --> 04:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
can have that kind of influence in terms
 
04:32:30.750 --> 04:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
of for the current existing commission
 
04:32:34.229 --> 04:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
that's going to be formed or the future
 
04:32:36.510 --> 04:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
commissions what
 
04:32:39.790 --> 04:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'm sorry I don't understand
 
04:32:41.830 --> 04:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
which commissions you're talking about
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
the commission to study the commission
 
04:32:47.950 --> 04:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
and the repeal the this bill that's oh
 
04:32:49.830 --> 04:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
this commission created by this bill is
 
04:32:52.269 --> 04:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
the one corre talking correct yeah it's
 
04:32:52.279 --> 04:32:55.189 align:start position:0%
the one corre talking correct yeah it's
it's

04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:32:58.910 --> 04:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
not I always hesitate to judge
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
somebody's motives because people do
 
04:33:04.590 --> 04:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
things for the weirdest reasons and very
 
04:33:06.349 --> 04:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
rarely for the reasons that I think
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
would make sense so I don't I assume I
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
don't know why you're doing it all I can
 
04:33:14.709 --> 04:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
do is say this is what you want to do
 
04:33:17.551 --> 04:33:17.561 align:start position:0%
and I signed off on this bill because I
 
04:33:20.269 --> 04:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
said we need to look at these things
 
04:33:23.629 --> 04:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
this creates a structured manner to do
 
04:33:28.070 --> 04:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
so and I think it's necessary we
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
keep um anybody who has
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
seen two
 
04:33:36.910 --> 04:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
separate uh versions of a committee on
 
04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
committees 10 years apart knows that you
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
know we accumulate clutter in our laws
 
04:33:44.310 --> 04:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
and so this is house this is a
 
04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measure God forbid that I
 
04:33:47.470 --> 04:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
should say
 
04:33:52.189 --> 04:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
so but it is it cleans up our statute
 
04:33:55.230 --> 04:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
and as is the case when you do your your
 
04:33:58.590 --> 04:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
housekeeping you make discover wow this
 
04:34:00.429 --> 04:34:00.439 align:start position:0%
is really nice I found some good stuff I
 
04:34:01.789 --> 04:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
didn't know I
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
had and I'm not expecting this to go
 
04:34:09.230 --> 04:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
around repealing all these licenses I
 
04:34:11.269 --> 04:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
think that what will happen is that we
 
04:34:13.150 --> 04:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
will look at the composition of the
 
04:34:17.789 --> 04:34:17.799 align:start position:0%
board and and say this is good for the
 
04:34:19.949 --> 04:34:19.959 align:start position:0%
most part there but there are obviously
 
04:34:26.830 --> 04:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:32.551 --> 04:34:32.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:36.510 --> 04:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
Maguire representative infantine
 
04:34:38.789 --> 04:34:38.799 align:start position:0%
assuming I'm pronouncing that correctly
 
04:34:45.789 --> 04:34:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
worse good afternoon folks my name is uh
 
04:34:50.830 --> 04:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
will infantine I represent Manchester
 
04:34:53.189 --> 04:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
I'm the chairman of the labor committee
 
04:34:55.349 --> 04:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh I'm also I serve as a vice chairman
 
04:34:58.349 --> 04:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire electricians board
 
04:35:01.150 --> 04:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
and uh speaking of myself not the board
 
04:35:03.310 --> 04:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to the parts of the bill
 
04:35:06.189 --> 04:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
about the um Sun setting of The the
 
04:35:08.189 --> 04:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
boards commissioner
 
04:35:10.390 --> 04:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
Courtney stepped into a job I don't
 
04:35:11.949 --> 04:35:11.959 align:start position:0%
think she knew how messed up things
 
04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
probably were uh she's done a fantastic
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
job of trying to organize things you
 
04:35:18.109 --> 04:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
different letterheads different
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
organizations some groups have 11 board
 
04:35:23.109 --> 04:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
members and they can never meet a quorum
 
04:35:26.269 --> 04:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh the electricians board you get your
 
04:35:29.349 --> 04:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh on the job hours and you get the
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
class and then you can apply to get your
 
04:35:33.869 --> 04:35:33.879 align:start position:0%
license uh have to come in front of the
 
04:35:35.390 --> 04:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
board if maybe you have a felony or
 
04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
something like that some of these other
 
04:35:38.269 --> 04:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
boards are very subjective you have to
 
04:35:40.830 --> 04:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
complete an essay no rules about what
 
04:35:44.070 --> 04:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
the essay should say who's um grading it
 
04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
to decide whether or not you get your
 
04:35:49.869 --> 04:35:49.879 align:start position:0%
license um one of them uh what I'm led
 
04:35:51.629 --> 04:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
to believe if they don't like that
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
person because they don't want more
 
04:35:53.869 --> 04:35:53.879 align:start position:0%
competition they don't give them a
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
license so obviously there's there's
 
04:35:58.590 --> 04:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
some things that that um Chris Courtney
 
04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
has had to do to kind of reain things in
 
04:36:03.269 --> 04:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
now this bill from my understanding
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
comes down from the governor's office I
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
spoke to the governor at length about
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
oplc he wants to bring more people into
 
04:36:12.310 --> 04:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
the state that can work he wants to
 
04:36:14.949 --> 04:36:14.959 align:start position:0%
bring more people in for jobs and he
 
04:36:17.750 --> 04:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't want uh licensing to be a
 
04:36:22.230 --> 04:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
hindrance um and I can respect that but
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
every board has its certain purpose now
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
some of them don't work some of them
 
04:36:29.830 --> 04:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
should be Consolidated I've seen the
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
bills that are coming in front of you
 
04:36:32.830 --> 04:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
there's a couple bills I think two
 
04:36:34.750 --> 04:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
individual bills for consolidation of
 
04:36:37.029 --> 04:36:37.039 align:start position:0%
certain boards those are all good and
 
04:36:37.039 --> 04:36:38.470 align:start position:0%
certain boards those are all good and
positive

04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
positive
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
things um my concern with the sun
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
setting is when you get rid of a board
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
you get rid of the institutional
 
04:36:46.709 --> 04:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
knowledge that has to do with that
 
04:36:49.070 --> 04:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
industry I am not an electrician I am
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
the one public member that is not an
 
04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
electrician but the others are so when
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
someone comes in front of the board
 
04:36:59.629 --> 04:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
because they violated a rule um and or
 
04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
and they need to come in front of us to
 
04:37:04.070 --> 04:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
get a bad boy slap uh we can find them
 
04:37:06.990 --> 04:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
we can uh suspend their licenses and and
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
do all kinds of other things to try to
 
04:37:11.709 --> 04:37:11.719 align:start position:0%
enforce uh the rules that we have in
 
04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
place if these boards Go away You're
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
left with
 
04:37:19.830 --> 04:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
oplc to manage the administrative work
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
to manage the investigations to manage
 
04:37:25.150 --> 04:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
the discipline and I'm not sure that all
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
being in one place is right another
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
position I have being the chairman of
 
04:37:31.949 --> 04:37:31.959 align:start position:0%
the labor committee is to be um a member
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire
 
04:37:35.709 --> 04:37:35.719 align:start position:0%
unemployment Securities advisor Advisory
 
04:37:38.189 --> 04:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
board so once a quarter we meet with the
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board to find out what's going
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
on with unemployment if there are
 
04:37:42.390 --> 04:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
complaints against unemployment how
 
04:37:43.629 --> 04:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
they're working and it was very
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
important during the
 
04:37:48.670 --> 04:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic and New Hampshire you know New
 
04:37:50.189 --> 04:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's different you know we all
 
04:37:51.470 --> 04:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
like to say that we're better than
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
everybody and we do things in the New
 
04:37:55.869 --> 04:37:55.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way but in that capacity on
 
04:37:58.109 --> 04:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
the on the Advisory Board to Employment
 
04:38:00.910 --> 04:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
Securities we get to question what's
 
04:38:03.230 --> 04:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
going on what's not working what needs
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
to be done and I like having
 
04:38:10.949 --> 04:38:10.959 align:start position:0%
individuals in the state to be able to
 
04:38:15.150 --> 04:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
question politely what the uh
 
04:38:16.910 --> 04:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
Departments of our state are
 
04:38:19.709 --> 04:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
doing and I'm much more comfortable with
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
electricians dealing with electricians
 
04:38:24.551 --> 04:38:24.561 align:start position:0%
and and uh Landscape Architects dealing
 
04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
with landscape architect issues and and
 
04:38:29.310 --> 04:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
all the other different commissions that
 
04:38:33.029 --> 04:38:33.039 align:start position:0%
we have versus members of the oplc that
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
may be lawyers or maybe lay people that
 
04:38:37.390 --> 04:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
don't know anything about some of these
 
04:38:40.510 --> 04:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
so it concerns me greatly that you would
 
04:38:44.949 --> 04:38:44.959 align:start position:0%
Sunset some of these boards on the other
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
hand change is difficult people push
 
04:38:49.349 --> 04:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
back on change there's been a lot of
 
04:38:50.590 --> 04:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
change the
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
oplc I I give commissioner Courtney
 
04:38:55.390 --> 04:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
credit for for her efforts and I think
 
04:38:57.470 --> 04:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
more of her efforts have been positive
 
04:38:57.480 --> 04:38:58.390 align:start position:0%
more of her efforts have been positive
than

04:38:58.390 --> 04:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:39:02.990 --> 04:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
negative um but let's not dismantle this
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
whole thing all right they serve a
 
04:39:07.949 --> 04:39:07.959 align:start position:0%
purpose some don't get rid of the ones
 
04:39:10.230 --> 04:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
that don't meet get rid of the ones that
 
04:39:11.830 --> 04:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
don't care about their industry enough
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
to have a board consolidate the ones
 
04:39:16.029 --> 04:39:16.039 align:start position:0%
that want to be Consolidated with
 
04:39:20.189 --> 04:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
similar type boards but um I I'm greatly
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to this sunsetting and I I hope
 
04:39:27.470 --> 04:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I hope you will uh study all you want
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
but don't even think about the
 
04:39:30.269 --> 04:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
sunsetting of some of these important
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.430 --> 04:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:39:38.628 --> 04:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
Gould thank you Mr
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
question my question is are you
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
concerned that your board if it were um
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
reviewed by a commission would be at
 
04:39:52.350 --> 04:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
risk of being um supported by the
 
04:39:56.430 --> 04:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
repealed well I don't we I'm not
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
concerned with the the board I'm on at
 
04:40:05.110 --> 04:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
all quite frankly we didn't miss a beat
 
04:40:07.628 --> 04:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
we didn't miss a a meeting during covid
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
we met we continue to meet we always
 
04:40:14.270 --> 04:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
have a quorum uh sometimes we're a pain
 
04:40:17.230 --> 04:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
right uh sometimes we we we push back
 
04:40:20.470 --> 04:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
and and ask a lot of questions uh but no
 
04:40:21.868 --> 04:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
I I
 
04:40:25.708 --> 04:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
I um I think we do it well I think we do
 
04:40:28.350 --> 04:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
it the way it was intended thank you
 
04:40:31.948 --> 04:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
then I think that speaks to what I see
 
04:40:33.868 --> 04:40:33.878 align:start position:0%
is happening with these repeals that
 
04:40:35.230 --> 04:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
it's just an opportunity opportunity to
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
review an opportunity to motivate and an
 
04:40:39.628 --> 04:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity as the chairman said to
 
04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
clean house which without cleaning house
 
04:40:45.030 --> 04:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
and you even alluded to some of the
 
04:40:46.590 --> 04:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
other boards it's always those other
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
boards that are the problem right and
 
04:40:51.070 --> 04:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
commissions but if there are boards that
 
04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
are doing nothing they really do need to
 
04:40:54.990 --> 04:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
be identified and this provides a
 
04:40:58.110 --> 04:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
structure I but I congratulate you for
 
04:41:00.350 --> 04:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
running a good board thank
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:41:05.390 --> 04:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:41:08.110 --> 04:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my questions
 
04:41:10.510 --> 04:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
as a former chair of Labor where you sit
 
04:41:10.520 --> 04:41:12.470 align:start position:0%
as a former chair of Labor where you sit
now

04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
um you've been around here long
 
04:41:17.708 --> 04:41:17.718 align:start position:0%
enough I'm sorry to say you and I have
 
04:41:20.550 --> 04:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
been around here probably way too long I
 
04:41:20.560 --> 04:41:23.230 align:start position:0%
been around here probably way too long I
know

04:41:23.230 --> 04:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:41:25.990 --> 04:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
um looking
 
04:41:31.628 --> 04:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
at sunsetting some very important
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
boards uh for putting the feet to the
 
04:41:39.270 --> 04:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
fire of a commission to do their work
 
04:41:39.280 --> 04:41:40.590 align:start position:0%
fire of a commission to do their work
work

04:41:40.590 --> 04:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:41:43.310 --> 04:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
that we all know if we've been around
 
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
here long enough that any commission
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
that does work and files their report of
 
04:41:49.200 --> 04:41:50.910 align:start position:0%
that does work and files their report of
recommended

04:41:50.910 --> 04:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
04:41:55.150 --> 04:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
changes does not necessarily mean those
 
04:41:58.110 --> 04:41:58.120 align:start position:0%
changes will be implemented by a future
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:06.670 --> 04:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
correct well of course I mean if if this
 
04:42:08.990 --> 04:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
legislature has a study in in in
 
04:42:13.350 --> 04:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
November decides to have the report done
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
um next year there's a new
 
04:42:18.670 --> 04:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
legislature um could be different
 
04:42:21.070 --> 04:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
chairman could be different uh uh
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
parties in in power and a lot of
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
different things as you and I know
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
things ebb and flow from year to year
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess of course it doesn't
 
04:42:33.030 --> 04:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean each legislature will
 
04:42:35.628 --> 04:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
follow it and then they could override
 
04:42:37.350 --> 04:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
two years later what the previous
 
04:42:40.030 --> 04:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
legislature put in place so do you think
 
04:42:43.150 --> 04:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
it's fair that the electrician board's
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
feet are held to the fire of losing
 
04:42:49.670 --> 04:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
their ability because of a commission
 
04:42:52.110 --> 04:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
that their report is not bound by the
 
04:42:52.120 --> 04:42:53.868 align:start position:0%
that their report is not bound by the
future

04:42:53.868 --> 04:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
future
 
04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
legislature I don't think any board is
 
04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
above reproach any board is above being
 
04:43:02.110 --> 04:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
looked at um some uh we had a situation
 
04:43:04.550 --> 04:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
you all read and saw on TV about a
 
04:43:06.628 --> 04:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
massage therapist that was doing some
 
04:43:08.110 --> 04:43:08.120 align:start position:0%
inappropriate things up in the north
 
04:43:10.030 --> 04:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
country and and the board was able to
 
04:43:12.670 --> 04:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
take their license away and act quickly
 
04:43:14.670 --> 04:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
um some boards you know you don't do
 
04:43:16.110 --> 04:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
things right on the electricians board
 
04:43:18.948 --> 04:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
you can get electrocuted or kill people
 
04:43:20.270 --> 04:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
um that's a little different maybe from
 
04:43:22.350 --> 04:43:22.360 align:start position:0%
the landscape AR Architects or what have
 
04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
you uh but each has its own purpose but
 
04:43:28.590 --> 04:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
again each one is open to review at any
 
04:43:30.990 --> 04:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
given time there was one board I don't
 
04:43:32.628 --> 04:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
recall the name where the governor got
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
mad and made a public display and said
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
if if you don't meet we're going to
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
disband you or get new people and
 
04:43:39.910 --> 04:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
replace you um and some boards do not
 
04:43:43.750 --> 04:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
take it as seriously in others
 
04:43:47.190 --> 04:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
um so everyone is is is worth like I
 
04:43:48.788 --> 04:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
said everyone's above reproach no one's
 
04:43:49.750 --> 04:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
above approach and they can all be
 
04:43:53.708 --> 04:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
looked at at any given time um I think
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
sunsetting some of these important
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
boards went way above and beyond uh what
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
I think is necessary at this
 
04:44:03.400 --> 04:44:06.708 align:start position:0%
I think is necessary at this
point

04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:08.230 --> 04:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm gonna thank you
 
04:44:30.948 --> 04:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.350 --> 04:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman for the
 
04:44:37.310 --> 04:44:37.320 align:start position:0%

which is do Ward 1 uh which I've had the
 
04:44:46.708 --> 04:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
privilege of representing for the past
 
04:44:46.718 --> 04:44:47.910 align:start position:0%
privilege of representing for the past
21

04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
21
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
years um and and I've been on this
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
committee for 17 or 18 of those years um
 
04:44:58.990 --> 04:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
and I've seen this bill
 
04:45:03.868 --> 04:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
before um and um at least substantial
 
04:45:07.948 --> 04:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
portion of it um and
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
the the the uh committee from roughly
 
04:45:17.230 --> 04:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
eight years ago uh had
 
04:45:23.230 --> 04:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
um had this bill itl this bill um and uh
 
04:45:26.270 --> 04:45:26.280 align:start position:0%

floor but um it got killed in in the
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
Senate um but this
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
is I
 
04:45:38.310 --> 04:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
I'm very much aware of the fact that
 
04:45:41.510 --> 04:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
that this hearing is being
 
04:45:43.868 --> 04:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
recorded and and
 
04:45:48.390 --> 04:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
I I call upon the people of State of New
 
04:45:50.830 --> 04:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to pay attention of what's
 
04:45:52.390 --> 04:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
going on with this
 
04:45:56.070 --> 04:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
bill because this bill is a frontal
 
04:46:00.390 --> 04:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
assault on a structure that's been being
 
04:46:02.270 --> 04:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
developed in this state for over a
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
hundred years we've had had a Board of
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
Medicine and a board of nursing and uh
 
04:46:11.390 --> 04:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
and various other crucial boards and the
 
04:46:16.110 --> 04:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
people who per who those boards govern
 
04:46:20.110 --> 04:46:20.120 align:start position:0%
and license have been providing
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
dentistry and and doctoring and
 
04:46:27.548 --> 04:46:27.558 align:start position:0%
nursing um and
 
04:46:31.548 --> 04:46:31.558 align:start position:0%
electrician uh service and so forth uh
 
04:46:36.030 --> 04:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
for a hundred years and plenty of other
 
04:46:38.270 --> 04:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
or um boards that have been put together
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
during that time and this this bill it
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
says it right out just look at it turn
 
04:46:47.788 --> 04:46:47.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:54.430 --> 04:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:57.548 --> 04:46:57.558 align:start position:0%
26 the commission's report shall include
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%

04:47:05.670 --> 04:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
legislature to enact legislation that a
 
04:47:11.270 --> 04:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
licenses now I think this my experience
 
04:47:17.948 --> 04:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
is everybody on this Commission on this
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee knows
 
04:47:23.948 --> 04:47:23.958 align:start position:0%

04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
there recommendations to the legislature
 
04:47:31.070 --> 04:47:31.080 align:start position:0%

business this this bill is not some kind
 
04:49:40.628 --> 04:49:40.638 align:start position:0%
of a review it is a frontal assault on
 
04:49:43.830 --> 04:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
the on the the economy and the

questions you may have but this is not
 
04:50:12.430 --> 04:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
04:50:18.830 --> 04:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
charge a frontal
 
04:50:23.990 --> 04:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
assault on the structure of this
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
state representative goul has a
 
04:50:29.670 --> 04:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:50:32.110 --> 04:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
04:50:34.750 --> 04:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
question you were reading to us from
 
04:50:34.760 --> 04:50:35.750 align:start position:0%
question you were reading to us from
page

04:50:35.750 --> 04:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:50:40.470 --> 04:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
two uh starting on line 26 and you read
 
04:50:43.948 --> 04:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
down through 28 29 which was A and B of
 
04:50:46.350 --> 04:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
that section and that section goes down
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
to line 36 what does line 36 say under
 
04:50:49.798 --> 04:50:53.150 align:start position:0%
to line 36 what does line 36 say under
that

04:50:53.150 --> 04:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:53.160 --> 04:50:54.868 align:start position:0%
 
section

04:50:54.868 --> 04:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:50:58.470 --> 04:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
936 on page two says makes no changes to
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
state law correct so am I Incorrect and
 
04:51:05.590 --> 04:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding here is that the the
 
04:51:07.750 --> 04:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
list that started with repeals the
 
04:51:11.230 --> 04:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
occupation licenses is the first of a
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
long list of possibilities or guides is
 
04:51:17.510 --> 04:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
what I heard the representative say who
 
04:51:19.868 --> 04:51:19.878 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill and that that list
 
04:51:22.628 --> 04:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
of recommendation ends with a
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
possibility that the commission could
 
04:51:27.150 --> 04:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
make no changes to the state law could
 
04:51:29.470 --> 04:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
just leave the board or the commission
 
04:51:33.030 --> 04:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
alone is that am I misunderstanding that
 
04:51:36.390 --> 04:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
well this this bill is so wrongheaded in
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
so many ways I don't know how it can
 
04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
turn right and left at the same time but
 
04:51:44.750 --> 04:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that for one thing
 
04:51:47.190 --> 04:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
this this is going to be one hell of a
 
04:51:51.430 --> 04:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
commission to serve on because when when
 
04:51:58.470 --> 04:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.190 --> 04:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
about 12 years ago under the reign of
 
04:52:06.750 --> 04:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
error and Terror of former speaker Bill
 
04:52:09.708 --> 04:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
O'Brien rep's Hall was filled with
 
04:52:11.708 --> 04:52:11.718 align:start position:0%
people but they weren't Representatives
 
04:52:14.230 --> 04:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
mostly they were representatives of the
 
04:52:14.240 --> 04:52:15.910 align:start position:0%
mostly they were representatives of the
44

04:52:15.910 --> 04:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
44
 
04:52:18.788 --> 04:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
boards and professions that were going
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:52:23.590 --> 04:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
deregulated by a bill that was offered
 
04:52:26.708 --> 04:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
at that particular time and every one of
 
04:52:28.868 --> 04:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
the people who got up and spoke said
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
please don't re please don't deregulate
 
04:52:34.390 --> 04:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
my profession or our profession
 
04:52:37.708 --> 04:52:37.718 align:start position:0%
fession and if you just listen one after
 
04:52:40.590 --> 04:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
another all the boards that were listed
 
04:52:42.628 --> 04:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
were going to be repeat
 
04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
deregulated and there were several
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
hundred people in rep's Hall saying
 
04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't do this to
 
04:52:53.150 --> 04:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
us well that bill didn't go anywhere but
 
04:52:56.830 --> 04:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
they came back uh with a slightly
 
04:53:01.510 --> 04:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
revised and slim down bill um that bill
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
didn't go anywhere either because one of
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
the one of the uh one of the professions
 
04:53:11.548 --> 04:53:11.558 align:start position:0%
that was going to be deregulated was
 
04:53:15.510 --> 04:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
guides and and former speaker Jean
 
04:53:17.910 --> 04:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
Chandler who was a committee chair at
 
04:53:21.150 --> 04:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
that time I believe he got up and and
 
04:53:24.628 --> 04:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
said uh want to floor Amendment want to
 
04:53:27.310 --> 04:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
strip that out because if you if you go
 
04:53:29.070 --> 04:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
out in the woods with a guy that doesn't
 
04:53:31.390 --> 04:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
know what he or she is doing you can
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
wind up dead in the state of New New
 
04:53:37.948 --> 04:53:37.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and since that that re that
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
removal didn't happen all of his people
 
04:53:45.270 --> 04:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
voted no so th this bill is such a
 
04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
monstrosity I can't imagine that the
 
04:53:49.510 --> 04:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
that the house is going to possibly
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
repeal this but we should we should
 
04:53:57.190 --> 04:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
unanimously itl this bill because uh the
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
the commission that's set up who's going
 
04:54:02.310 --> 04:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
to want to serve on that because it's
 
04:54:05.708 --> 04:54:05.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's hearings are going to be one
 
04:54:07.510 --> 04:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
profession after another coming up
 
04:54:10.190 --> 04:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
saying don't do this to
 
04:54:13.350 --> 04:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
us and with plenty of good reasons

provision of repealing the Guardian at

lien
 
04:55:06.510 --> 04:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
board having looked at the bill uh I
 
04:55:09.390 --> 04:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
really I have no objection to the idea
 
04:55:11.070 --> 04:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
of a commission although I might have
 
04:55:13.470 --> 04:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
some thoughts as to how it might be
 
04:55:15.230 --> 04:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
provided for in a little bit different
 
04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
manner than it's been
 
04:55:20.310 --> 04:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
proposed uh my main concern is the
 
04:55:23.590 --> 04:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
repeal as it's currently presented for
 
04:55:25.548 --> 04:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
the guardian at Lim
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
board currently the guardian the lighten
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
board is to be repealed as of July 1st
 
04:55:32.400 --> 04:55:34.390 align:start position:0%
board is to be repealed as of July 1st
2025

04:55:34.390 --> 04:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
2025
 
04:55:36.910 --> 04:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
I familiar with Guardian at lims I'm
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with Guardian at lims as a
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
legislator as a as a attorney as a judge
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
and now I sit on the guardian of lim
 
04:55:47.430 --> 04:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
board as a public me member appointed by
 
04:55:47.440 --> 04:55:48.788 align:start position:0%
board as a public me member appointed by
the

04:55:48.788 --> 04:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:55:51.548 --> 04:55:51.558 align:start position:0%
governor uh I over 20 years ago I
 
04:55:53.230 --> 04:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
sponsored the legislation creating the
 
04:55:56.430 --> 04:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
Govern the guardian at lium board uh
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
prior to that time Guardian Lems were
 
04:56:01.990 --> 04:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
appointed by the uh appointed by the
 
04:56:04.708 --> 04:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
court they were appointed with no
 
04:56:08.270 --> 04:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
qualifications with no training with no
 
04:56:11.150 --> 04:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
standards and with no process for
 
04:56:12.708 --> 04:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
discipline for
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
misbehavior the guardian item board was
 
04:56:19.230 --> 04:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
created and over the last 20 years those
 
04:56:21.548 --> 04:56:21.558 align:start position:0%
have been those practices have been
 
04:56:25.350 --> 04:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
established and we have a guardian elems
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
who are all certified qualified trained
 
04:56:32.830 --> 04:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
continuously trained and providing
 
04:56:35.948 --> 04:56:35.958 align:start position:0%
services to the state of New
 
04:56:39.270 --> 04:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the
 
04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the issue here is uh you the the
 
04:56:45.230 --> 04:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
way this is
 
04:56:47.230 --> 04:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
proposed uh the commission is going to
 
04:56:49.670 --> 04:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
look at this uh and it'd have to look at
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
it within a year in fact it might be
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
less than a year because it would all
 
04:56:54.830 --> 04:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
depend on when the governor signs the
 
04:56:56.470 --> 04:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill because the bill will be effective
 
04:57:00.350 --> 04:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
when the governor signs it it might not
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
be before July 1st 202 before and so in
 
04:57:10.230 --> 04:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
any event uh it's only one year so look
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
at it this way if the commission doesn't
 
04:57:15.150 --> 04:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
act in one year the guardian lightning
 
04:57:21.430 --> 04:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:23.350 --> 04:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities if you said well
 
04:57:25.830 --> 04:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else has to do that well who's
 
04:57:27.548 --> 04:57:27.558 align:start position:0%
going to do that maybe the courts would
 
04:57:29.310 --> 04:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
have to do that but if they did that
 
04:57:30.670 --> 04:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
they'd have to do the same thing the
 
04:57:33.590 --> 04:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
garden board's already done put in rules
 
04:57:35.788 --> 04:57:35.798 align:start position:0%
establish rules in the court
 
04:57:39.310 --> 04:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
system require training provide training
 
04:57:41.548 --> 04:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
the way the guardian liem board's done
 
04:57:44.628 --> 04:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
do all of those things so one year is
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
just frankly
 
04:57:52.230 --> 04:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
absurd and it appears uh just just
 
04:57:54.510 --> 04:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
absurd just doesn't work so even if you
 
04:57:57.548 --> 04:57:57.558 align:start position:0%
were to say it has to be repealed you
 
04:58:00.190 --> 04:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
should at least give it 3 years five
 
04:58:02.548 --> 04:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
years some some reasonable period of
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
time one year is just ridiculous
 
04:58:06.480 --> 04:58:08.788 align:start position:0%
time one year is just ridiculous
okay

04:58:08.788 --> 04:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:58:12.270 --> 04:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
the just uh and so I'm asking that I
 
04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
first the the other thing is I just ask
 
04:58:17.948 --> 04:58:17.958 align:start position:0%
you not to repeal it but uh I think you
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
have to look at that in terms of the
 
04:58:19.440 --> 04:58:20.310 align:start position:0%
have to look at that in terms of the
whole

04:58:20.310 --> 04:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:58:24.310 --> 04:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
bill the other looking back at the idea
 
04:58:26.030 --> 04:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
creating the
 
04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
commission and I think the point was
 
04:58:30.310 --> 04:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
just made by representative Smith and
 
04:58:32.030 --> 04:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
that is you look at these commissions
 
04:58:33.708 --> 04:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
these are these are commissions in here
 
04:58:36.150 --> 04:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know aren't going to be repealed
 
04:58:37.350 --> 04:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
there might be some changes but they
 
04:58:39.910 --> 04:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be
 
04:58:44.070 --> 04:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
repealed uh my suggestion is put your
 
04:58:46.750 --> 04:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
commission in place for two years and
 
04:58:48.670 --> 04:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
pick the boards and
 
04:58:51.510 --> 04:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
commissions that you think have the
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
greatest need and they frankly they've
 
04:58:54.948 --> 04:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
already done that for you because
 
04:58:58.190 --> 04:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
they've taken one and two uh if you look
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
at section one and two under the repeals
 
04:59:02.110 --> 04:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
obviously Somebody went through that and
 
04:59:04.190 --> 04:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
said because it the quickest ones to be
 
04:59:05.788 --> 04:59:05.798 align:start position:0%
repealed somebody thinks those are the
 
04:59:07.230 --> 04:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
ones that ought to be
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
repealed so I think if you go through
 
04:59:12.548 --> 04:59:12.558 align:start position:0%
and say okay we're going to establish
 
04:59:14.110 --> 04:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
commission for two years we're going to
 
04:59:15.948 --> 04:59:15.958 align:start position:0%
look at those commissions they have to
 
04:59:18.708 --> 04:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
do that in that two-year period of
 
04:59:21.788 --> 04:59:21.798 align:start position:0%
time and they they're the ones that have
 
04:59:23.470 --> 04:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
to make the change and frankly repeal
 
04:59:25.990 --> 04:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
the commission at the end of two years
 
04:59:28.030 --> 04:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
so that's where the repeal ought to
 
04:59:31.948 --> 04:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
be okay and the the last comment that
 
04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
I'd have is a comment with regard to the
 
04:59:37.070 --> 04:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
membership of the
 
04:59:39.788 --> 04:59:39.798 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm speaking as a private
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
citizen today by the way but uh so no
 
04:59:44.350 --> 04:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
offense to
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
legislators but has three members of the
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
legislature appointed by the house three
 
04:59:52.230 --> 04:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
three members of the legislator
 
04:59:54.310 --> 04:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Senate President you
 
04:59:57.948 --> 04:59:57.958 align:start position:0%
know you've got a majority uh in essence
 
05:00:01.470 --> 05:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
not a majority but uh a large group of
 
05:00:03.948 --> 05:00:03.958 align:start position:0%
legislators what concern me as a private
 
05:00:03.958 --> 05:00:05.470 align:start position:0%
legislators what concern me as a private
citizen

05:00:05.470 --> 05:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
05:00:08.708 --> 05:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
is who are the legislators to actually
 
05:00:12.310 --> 05:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
be qualified to decide these boards
 
05:00:15.030 --> 05:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
aren't you better to find people who
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
would call with some appointee from the
 
05:00:19.628 --> 05:00:19.638 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association be
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
somebody better to make an analysis of
 
05:00:26.230 --> 05:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of boards the cost
 
05:00:29.430 --> 05:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness and of oplc which I think
 
05:00:30.670 --> 05:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
has its own
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
issues so uh I think I if I were looking
 
05:00:38.510 --> 05:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
at C and I can tell you on this on the
 
05:00:40.788 --> 05:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
we have some issues with regard to
 
05:00:42.470 --> 05:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
getting a quorum at the guardian lighten
 
05:00:46.390 --> 05:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
board we meet usually but usually what
 
05:00:47.830 --> 05:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
our biggest problem is is getting the
 
05:00:49.868 --> 05:00:49.878 align:start position:0%
two legislators the senator and the and
 
05:00:51.830 --> 05:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
the rep there to show
 
05:00:51.840 --> 05:00:53.590 align:start position:0%
the rep there to show
up

05:00:53.590 --> 05:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
okay and if they showed up more often
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
qum wouldn't be as much of a problem for
 
05:01:03.310 --> 05:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
us so uh and so I would think that you
 
05:01:04.548 --> 05:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
want to have people if you're going to
 
05:01:06.230 --> 05:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
run this commission you'd want to have
 
05:01:07.788 --> 05:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
people who are qualified on the
 
05:01:09.910 --> 05:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
commission not just because they're
 
05:01:11.948 --> 05:01:11.958 align:start position:0%
legislators because as a private citizen
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say with six legislators on
 
05:01:17.230 --> 05:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
there this is going to be a political
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
commission not not a commission directed
 
05:01:22.510 --> 05:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
at resolving the problem that's intended
 
05:01:23.788 --> 05:01:23.798 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
resolved okay those are my thoughts
 
05:01:30.510 --> 05:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any
 
05:01:34.270 --> 05:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank oh representative
 
05:01:37.750 --> 05:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
Moody thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
Gordon for taking my question
 
05:01:44.830 --> 05:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
um your last statement confirmed my
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
doubt in terms of this commission would
 
05:01:49.868 --> 05:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
be very politically driven because
 
05:01:52.110 --> 05:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
05:01:56.430 --> 05:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
heavy more members of legislation than
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
the people in profession or from common
 
05:02:02.510 --> 05:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
things so that would impact every two
 
05:02:04.590 --> 05:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
years like we have in New Hampshire
 
05:02:06.990 --> 05:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that so the
 
05:02:09.868 --> 05:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
productivity of this board or this
 
05:02:12.070 --> 05:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
commission I should
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
say would be a
 
05:02:19.350 --> 05:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
issue well um my bigger concern I think
 
05:02:21.948 --> 05:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
the concern was raised earlier about the
 
05:02:24.030 --> 05:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
predictability of who's going to be in
 
05:02:26.030 --> 05:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
power and conquered at any given time
 
05:02:29.628 --> 05:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
and how that affects legislation and
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
what gets accomplished so that's my my
 
05:02:34.190 --> 05:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
biggest concern and that's one of the
 
05:02:35.548 --> 05:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
reasons why I think the commission
 
05:02:37.510 --> 05:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
should when you create this commission
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
you should put it into effect not
 
05:02:42.788 --> 05:02:42.798 align:start position:0%
forever but for two years with a sunset
 
05:02:45.548 --> 05:02:45.558 align:start position:0%
pick particular boards that you think
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
probably should be addressed are you
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
going to do away with a real estate
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
board no you know if you think you ought
 
05:02:53.270 --> 05:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
to study the real estate board study the
 
05:02:56.190 --> 05:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
real estate board but I don't think you
 
05:02:58.030 --> 05:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
need to I don't think there's any
 
05:03:00.150 --> 05:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
purpose in the world of saying okay
 
05:03:03.390 --> 05:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
we've got a sunset that today
 
05:03:04.628 --> 05:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine are you going to
 
05:03:06.190 --> 05:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
Sunset the Board of Medicine does that
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
make any sense to anybody doesn't make
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
any sense to me and I don't think it
 
05:03:12.190 --> 05:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
makes much sense to most of the people
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:19.708 --> 05:03:19.718 align:start position:0%
state thank you sir thank you everybody
 
05:03:22.750 --> 05:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
um next and it's my old eyes I see
 
05:03:27.430 --> 05:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
coretti and something with an H is
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.680 --> 05:03:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
coretti

05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:37.990 --> 05:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Glee corsetti
 
05:03:39.868 --> 05:03:39.878 align:start position:0%
Hooper I'm the public member on the
 
05:03:42.070 --> 05:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
naturopathic Board of
 
05:03:46.150 --> 05:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
examiners and I don't really have a yay
 
05:03:48.310 --> 05:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
or nay on this bill because I don't I
 
05:03:49.868 --> 05:03:49.878 align:start position:0%
didn't really understand it when I read
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
it but I was very concerned about the
 
05:03:56.430 --> 05:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
repeal and I guess I have a few three
 
05:03:56.440 --> 05:03:58.070 align:start position:0%
repeal and I guess I have a few three
questions

05:03:58.070 --> 05:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:04:01.230 --> 05:04:01.240 align:start position:0%
um one
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
is uh just before I got on the board I'm
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
serving my second term so I've been on
 
05:04:10.070 --> 05:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
for six years and I have four more years
 
05:04:14.350 --> 05:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh we had an audit and so we spent at
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
least two or three years addressing all
 
05:04:18.990 --> 05:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the audit and I don't
 
05:04:21.708 --> 05:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
even exactly know who did the audit I
 
05:04:23.830 --> 05:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was jail car or who it
 
05:04:25.510 --> 05:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
was but I guess I'm
 
05:04:29.430 --> 05:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
wondering um you know do all the boards
 
05:04:32.788 --> 05:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
get audited and if this is some
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
replacement for auditing um that was a
 
05:04:36.240 --> 05:04:37.190 align:start position:0%
replacement for auditing um that was a
very

05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:04:40.830 --> 05:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
specific uh look at the statute and what
 
05:04:42.868 --> 05:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
we were missing in statute and rules and
 
05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
whatnot and we addressed all those
 
05:04:47.470 --> 05:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
things and and so there was that um I
 
05:04:49.788 --> 05:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
just want to comment on that I also want
 
05:04:51.830 --> 05:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
to comment on the governor's
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
appointments of people because when I
 
05:04:56.230 --> 05:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
recently got reappointed I found out
 
05:04:58.548 --> 05:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
from the young lady who works for
 
05:05:01.628 --> 05:05:01.638 align:start position:0%
governor Nunu that the public member on
 
05:05:03.708 --> 05:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
the board of natural Catholic examiners
 
05:05:05.390 --> 05:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
is one of the public members that's
 
05:05:08.548 --> 05:05:08.558 align:start position:0%
appointed only by the governor so it
 
05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
took a long time and then she was able
 
05:05:13.390 --> 05:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
to sort of expedited when I called other
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
public members of support are appointed
 
05:05:17.150 --> 05:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
by the governor and then have to be
 
05:05:20.110 --> 05:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
approved by the executive committee so
 
05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
um it seems to
 
05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
me you know knowing who how and who the
 
05:05:27.430 --> 05:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
governor appoints and who's involved in
 
05:05:29.590 --> 05:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
all that process would be useful and
 
05:05:29.600 --> 05:05:30.830 align:start position:0%
all that process would be useful and
maybe

05:05:30.830 --> 05:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
standardized um and then the third thing
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
is that I'm aware of um a sunset law in
 
05:05:41.350 --> 05:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
in Florida which was the first state in
 
05:05:44.150 --> 05:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
the country to license naturopathic
 
05:05:47.868 --> 05:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
doctors and you know it's a small
 
05:05:50.708 --> 05:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
profession I think it's extremely
 
05:05:54.190 --> 05:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
important for the public and the
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
well-being and health and benefits of
 
05:06:01.150 --> 05:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
the people of the state and
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
um as as far as I know right now there
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
are somewhere between 115 and 120
 
05:06:08.390 --> 05:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
naturopaths in the state of New
 
05:06:10.910 --> 05:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so and they're all you know up
 
05:06:14.230 --> 05:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
to their eyeballs and busy patient care
 
05:06:15.868 --> 05:06:15.878 align:start position:0%
and they don't have lob you know they
 
05:06:18.030 --> 05:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
have one lobbyist that works for the
 
05:06:22.270 --> 05:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
State Association and they
 
05:06:25.350 --> 05:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
um they would have you know a difficult
 
05:06:25.360 --> 05:06:27.070 align:start position:0%
um they would have you know a difficult
time

05:06:27.070 --> 05:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:06:30.030 --> 05:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
um I think mounting the support that
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
they would need to try to deal with some
 
05:06:34.948 --> 05:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
some kind of repeal if that were to
 
05:06:37.830 --> 05:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
happen um
 
05:06:42.110 --> 05:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
so in New in Florida the law Sunset it
 
05:06:45.868 --> 05:06:45.878 align:start position:0%
never did get reenacted and they don't
 
05:06:49.030 --> 05:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
have naturopathic doctors down there um
 
05:06:51.670 --> 05:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
so that's what happened there and I
 
05:06:53.430 --> 05:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
would really hate to see that happen
 
05:06:56.628 --> 05:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
here I you know personally have been the
 
05:06:59.390 --> 05:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of naturopathic medicine for
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
about well I was involved in the
 
05:07:03.390 --> 05:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
hearings when the log up passed about 26
 
05:07:07.190 --> 05:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
or S years ago and um I was the
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
president of the Autism Society for 10
 
05:07:12.190 --> 05:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
years and raised a son on the autism so
 
05:07:17.070 --> 05:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
on spectrum and was hugely helped by the
 
05:07:19.548 --> 05:07:19.558 align:start position:0%
guidance and benefit you know from the
 
05:07:21.470 --> 05:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors that I saw here and
 
05:07:25.310 --> 05:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
still do so I guess that's just all I
 
05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to say and I thank you very much
 
05:07:28.990 --> 05:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
and if anybody has any questions I'd be
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
happy to are are there any
 
05:07:34.990 --> 05:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
questions oh representative Brown um
 
05:07:37.110 --> 05:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
my question could could you just repeat
 
05:07:40.350 --> 05:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
what you said about Florida so that I'm
 
05:07:42.190 --> 05:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
sure I understood that they had a
 
05:07:46.270 --> 05:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
similar legislation and it caused well
 
05:07:48.910 --> 05:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
Florida I don't know the details of this
 
05:07:50.590 --> 05:07:50.600 align:start position:0%
I just know from the naturopaths that
 
05:07:52.948 --> 05:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to that Florida I think was
 
05:07:55.470 --> 05:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
the first state in the nation to license
 
05:07:59.628 --> 05:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
naturopaths as doctors um and you know
 
05:08:01.390 --> 05:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
they go to four years of postgraduate
 
05:08:04.110 --> 05:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
medical Medical school and whatnot and
 
05:08:07.110 --> 05:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
then the the law Sunset and the
 
05:08:10.030 --> 05:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
profession wasn't up and aable to you
 
05:08:12.830 --> 05:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
know reintroduce legislation I don't
 
05:08:14.830 --> 05:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
know how or why that happened but there
 
05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
are no licensed naturopaths in Florida
 
05:08:19.230 --> 05:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
now thank you that's what I understand
 
05:08:19.240 --> 05:08:20.110 align:start position:0%
now thank you that's what I understand
thank

05:08:20.110 --> 05:08:20.120 align:start position:0%

05:09:02.750 --> 05:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee rejects the bill as relates to
 
05:09:05.628 --> 05:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
the sunset of the boards as I understand
 
05:09:08.350 --> 05:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
this bill written in English I do
 
05:09:11.788 --> 05:09:11.798 align:start position:0%
understand English absent any changes
 
05:09:15.070 --> 05:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
the board of accountancy will sunset 71
 
05:09:18.670 --> 05:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
2026 no ifs ands about it that is what
 
05:09:21.070 --> 05:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
is written I believe that our board
 
05:09:23.350 --> 05:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
provides oversight and helps to protect
 
05:09:26.230 --> 05:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
the Commerce within the state of New
 
05:09:28.750 --> 05:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this bill will eliminate the
 
05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
oversight which ultimately could harm
 
05:09:32.510 --> 05:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
the public and other users of financial
 
05:09:34.670 --> 05:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
statements and tax
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
returns that also includes Department of
 
05:09:40.070 --> 05:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue as far as state tax returns
 
05:09:41.230 --> 05:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
being filed
 
05:09:43.590 --> 05:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
timely again I humbly request that this
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee rejects the bill as it will
 
05:09:47.548 --> 05:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
diminish the protection of the public
 
05:09:47.558 --> 05:09:50.628 align:start position:0%
diminish the protection of the public
thank

05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:53.750 --> 05:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon again Charles pal
 
05:09:56.270 --> 05:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
from the board of accountancy uh Mr
 
05:09:57.868 --> 05:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee thank you
 
05:09:59.430 --> 05:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak once again
 
05:10:02.548 --> 05:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
today with regard to House Bill 16
 
05:10:05.708 --> 05:10:05.718 align:start position:0%
76 uh I have also submitted uh written
 
05:10:08.110 --> 05:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
comments in opposition and those should
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
be before
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
you I had many many remarks when this
 
05:10:15.830 --> 05:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
hearing started but so many people have
 
05:10:18.150 --> 05:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
repeated what I would have said that I
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to belabor the issues too
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
much I would go simply um to this uh
 
05:10:27.150 --> 05:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
concern in this
 
05:10:31.070 --> 05:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
bill uh the default is repeal and I
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
think that that is an extremely risky
 
05:10:37.628 --> 05:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
gamut I'm I'm reminded as I sit here of
 
05:10:40.110 --> 05:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
an old saying that I've heard many many
 
05:10:42.990 --> 05:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
times if you want to hear God laugh just
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
tell him your plans and my concern here
 
05:10:50.590 --> 05:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
is that um the
 
05:10:53.310 --> 05:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
commission and this has been recognized
 
05:10:57.070 --> 05:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
as being uh a risk of commissions will
 
05:11:00.350 --> 05:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
not act in a timely fashion and bills
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
will be repealed including
 
05:11:04.750 --> 05:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
the statutory Authority for the board of
 
05:11:06.910 --> 05:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
accountancy I can tell you that I have
 
05:11:09.070 --> 05:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
served I'm a public member on the board
 
05:11:11.430 --> 05:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not an accountant and I have served
 
05:11:13.470 --> 05:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
on the board for going on three years
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
now I have been impressed from the
 
05:11:19.788 --> 05:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
beginning with the enthusiasm and
 
05:11:22.190 --> 05:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
professionalism of the members of our
 
05:11:25.750 --> 05:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
board both public members and accountant
 
05:11:30.190 --> 05:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
members uh we to my recollection and I
 
05:11:32.510 --> 05:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
think Ed would support me on this we
 
05:11:36.150 --> 05:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
have never lacked a quorum for a meeting
 
05:11:37.750 --> 05:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
whether it was a normally scheduled
 
05:11:40.350 --> 05:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
meeting or a special meeting called on
 
05:11:43.030 --> 05:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
an emergency basis such as we had this
 
05:11:45.868 --> 05:11:45.878 align:start position:0%
morning at 8:15 a.m. to discuss the
 
05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
various legislation that's being
 
05:11:49.788 --> 05:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
considered by this committee I think it
 
05:11:53.750 --> 05:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
would be a travesty for the authority of
 
05:11:56.310 --> 05:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
the board of accountancy to be repealed
 
05:11:58.150 --> 05:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
whether on purpose or by accident
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
through inaction and I just wanted to
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
express those concern concerns to the
 
05:12:04.990 --> 05:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
committee here today of course I thank
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
you for allowing uh me to speak and I'm
 
05:12:08.868 --> 05:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
perfectly willing to entertain any
 
05:12:11.230 --> 05:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
questions that any of you may have are
 
05:12:13.948 --> 05:12:13.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:17.430 --> 05:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Brown uh thank
 
05:12:19.788 --> 05:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair you might be able to answer
 
05:12:22.030 --> 05:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
what I started asking much earlier in
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
this um do you feel that
 
05:12:30.070 --> 05:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's reason to review these
 
05:12:32.510 --> 05:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
boards on some
 
05:12:35.430 --> 05:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
timely basis with with without having a
 
05:12:38.830 --> 05:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
repeal piece but let's make the
 
05:12:41.030 --> 05:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
assumption that the conversation we
 
05:12:43.548 --> 05:12:43.558 align:start position:0%
should review these boards regardless of
 
05:12:45.750 --> 05:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
how we force the commission to do it
 
05:12:48.628 --> 05:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
but my answer to that is simple I think
 
05:12:52.150 --> 05:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
that a review of existing boards is
 
05:12:53.788 --> 05:12:53.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate whether or not it's
 
05:12:55.670 --> 05:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
necessary at this point in time I don't
 
05:12:58.110 --> 05:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
know but I can tell you this I think
 
05:13:00.830 --> 05:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
that as legislators that is probably the
 
05:13:03.750 --> 05:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
type of thing that you want to review on
 
05:13:05.910 --> 05:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
a regular basis if you will to make sure
 
05:13:08.230 --> 05:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
that needs are being met the problem
 
05:13:10.350 --> 05:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
that the board sees the major problem
 
05:13:11.788 --> 05:13:11.798 align:start position:0%
that the board the board of accountancy
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
sees with this bill is the uh repeal by
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
default which is very very dangerous we
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
think thank
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
you as a followup I my only point I
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
would like to add to that is I think
 
05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
oplc would be able
 
05:13:30.070 --> 05:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
to identify those boards that are not
 
05:13:32.470 --> 05:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
performing so you would would actually
 
05:13:34.670 --> 05:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
highlight the ones that need help and
 
05:13:42.270 --> 05:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:44.948 --> 05:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
44 representative
 
05:13:47.230 --> 05:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
Gould hi thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:13:49.350 --> 05:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question don't you
 
05:13:50.990 --> 05:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
think that would put a lot of burden on
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
oplc and create a hostile environment
 
05:13:55.110 --> 05:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
within the
 
05:13:58.270 --> 05:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
office yeah it already is no no actually
 
05:13:59.670 --> 05:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
we have a great work and relationship
 
05:14:03.390 --> 05:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
with oplc and I I think think if um you
 
05:14:05.548 --> 05:14:05.558 align:start position:0%
know Courtney came to us and expressed
 
05:14:07.150 --> 05:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
unhappiness with certain things what we
 
05:14:08.990 --> 05:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
were doing as a board we would certainly
 
05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
address them I know myself now as the
 
05:14:13.030 --> 05:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
chair we would address them may I
 
05:14:15.510 --> 05:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
briefly uh add a comment to that
 
05:14:18.310 --> 05:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
certainly one of the things that we have
 
05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
um discussed at the board among many is
 
05:14:24.470 --> 05:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that we are Revenue net
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
positive um by I don't know the numbers
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
exactly but by a substantial Yeah by a
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
substantial amount so I think that oplc
 
05:14:34.990 --> 05:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
at least with regard to the board of
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
accountancy is um is satisfied with with
 
05:14:41.548 --> 05:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
our performance and certainly we've
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
shown our enthusiasm for the work that
 
05:14:47.628 --> 05:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
we do by our attendance and um ability
 
05:14:49.590 --> 05:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
to address any issues as they come up
 
05:14:50.948 --> 05:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:54.628 --> 05:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
followup yes go ahead thank you Mr
 
05:14:57.430 --> 05:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
chair I thank you for that answer and I
 
05:14:59.230 --> 05:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
hear from you the good work that you're
 
05:15:01.750 --> 05:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
doing and the relationship you have and
 
05:15:04.310 --> 05:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
I think uh it's been said before we hear
 
05:15:06.310 --> 05:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
from a lot of the boards on a lot of
 
05:15:07.948 --> 05:15:07.958 align:start position:0%
different bills and we see the good work
 
05:15:11.548 --> 05:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
people are doing it's um I look forward
 
05:15:15.390 --> 05:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
to the work of the subcommittee on uh on
 
05:15:17.430 --> 05:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
some of the language perhaps but I think
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
that that the fear that's been created
 
05:15:21.030 --> 05:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
by the word
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
repeal uh which was intended as a carrot
 
05:15:26.070 --> 05:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
on a stick to motivate people to get a
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
review done is unnecessary because you
 
05:15:31.590 --> 05:15:31.600 align:start position:0%

05:16:33.150 --> 05:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
board disappears each of these boards is
 
05:16:35.390 --> 05:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
part of the complex system that supports
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
Building Safety in the state and the
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
state building code is one of the major
 
05:16:43.628 --> 05:16:43.638 align:start position:0%
pieces of this very complex system six
 
05:16:46.990 --> 05:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
of these boards nominate members to the
 
05:16:50.350 --> 05:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
of to our 17 member building code review
 
05:16:52.750 --> 05:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
board so I respectfully suggest that
 
05:16:54.628 --> 05:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
defaulting to the elimination of these
 
05:16:56.910 --> 05:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
boards as part of a longer list of
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
boards runs the risk that something
 
05:17:01.708 --> 05:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
slows down the replacement process and
 
05:17:04.270 --> 05:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
the implications Cascade through the
 
05:17:06.788 --> 05:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
building safety process a better
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
approach would be to continue the boards
 
05:17:10.430 --> 05:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
on which there are General agreement
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature chooses to
 
05:17:15.548 --> 05:17:15.558 align:start position:0%
specifically eliminate them happy to
 
05:17:17.110 --> 05:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
05:17:19.788 --> 05:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
questions are there any
 
05:17:22.590 --> 05:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Brown uh thank
 
05:17:24.548 --> 05:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chair maybe it's getting late
 
05:17:25.868 --> 05:17:25.878 align:start position:0%
in the day here I am asking for
 
05:17:28.628 --> 05:17:28.638 align:start position:0%
clarification again can you repeat what
 
05:17:32.030 --> 05:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
you said several of the boards provide
 
05:17:35.948 --> 05:17:35.958 align:start position:0%
S Suggest our board consists of 16
 
05:17:38.070 --> 05:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
members nominated by what I'll call
 
05:17:40.948 --> 05:17:40.958 align:start position:0%
constituent groups uh various portions
 
05:17:42.590 --> 05:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
of the building industry and then
 
05:17:44.708 --> 05:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
appointed by the commissioner of safety
 
05:17:47.070 --> 05:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
plus myself as a 17th member appointed
 
05:17:51.270 --> 05:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner six of those 16 uh
 
05:17:53.750 --> 05:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
constituent groups are represented by
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:20.948 --> 05:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
Bell good afternoon thank you Mr chair
 
05:18:22.830 --> 05:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
and house executive department and
 
05:18:24.910 --> 05:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
administration committee members thank
 
05:18:27.230 --> 05:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
you for this opportunity to share our
 
05:18:29.788 --> 05:18:29.798 align:start position:0%
perspective my name is jod Bell I am a
 
05:18:31.708 --> 05:18:31.718 align:start position:0%
licensed acupuncturist here in New
 
05:18:33.788 --> 05:18:33.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I serve on the New Hampshire
 
05:18:36.350 --> 05:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
Board of acupuncture licensing but I am
 
05:18:38.470 --> 05:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
here today as a member of our state
 
05:18:40.750 --> 05:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
professional association representing
 
05:18:42.830 --> 05:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire acupuncture and Asian
 
05:18:45.548 --> 05:18:45.558 align:start position:0%
medicine Association also referred to as
 
05:18:49.070 --> 05:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
nahama so I agree with many of those who
 
05:18:51.310 --> 05:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
have expressed opposition today very
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
thorough and specific especially
 
05:18:55.788 --> 05:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
regarding Miss Cooper's mention of an
 
05:18:59.470 --> 05:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
audit that was something that our board
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
went through which was very ful and we
 
05:19:05.150 --> 05:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
did it and it was fine so I wish to
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
present our letter to the committee
 
05:19:09.030 --> 05:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrating our association stand on
 
05:19:13.310 --> 05:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
HB 1676 FN currently on the agenda I
 
05:19:15.350 --> 05:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
believe you all have a copy of that in
 
05:19:15.360 --> 05:19:17.190 align:start position:0%
believe you all have a copy of that in
your

05:19:17.190 --> 05:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:19:20.670 --> 05:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
possession I'll just skip to the meat of
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
it it is the position of the New
 
05:19:24.510 --> 05:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire acupuncture and Asian medicine
 
05:19:26.948 --> 05:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
Association Nama that the sunset
 
05:19:30.750 --> 05:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
commission proposed by hb1 1676 FN is
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
not necess necessary it is in our
 
05:19:35.708 --> 05:19:35.718 align:start position:0%
opinion it is redundant wasteful and neg
 
05:19:38.390 --> 05:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
negligent for Public Safety it is
 
05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to imagine members of the
 
05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
House are looking for ways that a person
 
05:19:43.350 --> 05:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
could practice in a health care field
 
05:19:46.190 --> 05:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
such as acupuncture that is below the
 
05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
National Standard of our profession or
 
05:19:50.990 --> 05:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
Worse without the need of a license or
 
05:19:54.270 --> 05:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
even without a superv supervisory board
 
05:19:56.510 --> 05:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
if allowed to pass these are possible
 
05:20:00.590 --> 05:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
outcomes of hb1 1676 FN the board of
 
05:20:02.788 --> 05:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
acupunctural licensing has done its due
 
05:20:04.830 --> 05:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
diligence since its Inception of our
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
license in 1997 and is assured that New
 
05:20:09.628 --> 05:20:09.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire practitioners meet
 
05:20:11.910 --> 05:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
professionalism ethics and safety levels
 
05:20:14.190 --> 05:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
as set forth by the national
 
05:20:16.670 --> 05:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
certification commission for acupuncture
 
05:20:19.590 --> 05:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
and Oriental medicine which protects the
 
05:20:22.708 --> 05:20:22.718 align:start position:0%
practitioner and the public over the
 
05:20:24.750 --> 05:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
past two years alone the board of
 
05:20:27.310 --> 05:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
acupuncture has worked with opsc to
 
05:20:29.590 --> 05:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
clarify language in the RSA and create
 
05:20:31.788 --> 05:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
rules and guidelines that Auto aate the
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
online licensing of acupuncturist in our
 
05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
state these measures are in step with
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
other licensed professions the
 
05:20:41.150 --> 05:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
acupuncture board creates more ways to
 
05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
show competency and education which
 
05:20:45.270 --> 05:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
opens the license to acupuncturists who
 
05:20:47.430 --> 05:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
are not only trained outside of the
 
05:20:50.350 --> 05:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
US but also train nationally without
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
loosening the standards we've already
 
05:20:55.190 --> 05:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
done this work so some may argue for
 
05:20:57.628 --> 05:20:57.638 align:start position:0%
loosening standards because there have
 
05:20:59.750 --> 05:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
been very few negative incidences in the
 
05:21:01.788 --> 05:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
state showing that acup puncture is a
 
05:21:04.548 --> 05:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
low-risk profession however nahama
 
05:21:06.390 --> 05:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
maintains that there have been very few
 
05:21:09.708 --> 05:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
incidences of concern because of the
 
05:21:12.430 --> 05:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
high standards of practice and the
 
05:21:15.628 --> 05:21:15.638 align:start position:0%
acupuncture Board of our
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
peers nahama believes the sunset
 
05:21:20.030 --> 05:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
commission creates an unnecessary
 
05:21:22.670 --> 05:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
redundancy work already completed as
 
05:21:24.948 --> 05:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
stated in the bill the real purpose is
 
05:21:27.150 --> 05:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
find ways to loosen the standards for
 
05:21:29.548 --> 05:21:29.558 align:start position:0%
more practice of a profession in a state
 
05:21:31.910 --> 05:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
intended to increase employment
 
05:21:35.590 --> 05:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
M another is to reduce cost it seems the
 
05:21:39.190 --> 05:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
focus of the hb1 1676 FN is more about
 
05:21:42.030 --> 05:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
reducing costs than protecting Public
 
05:21:44.708 --> 05:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
Safety it is best to have a board that
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
keeps the pulse on the profession of for
 
05:21:49.788 --> 05:21:49.798 align:start position:0%
a higher standard of care currently the
 
05:21:53.310 --> 05:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
cost is $25 per person per meeting with
 
05:21:55.670 --> 05:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
an average of four meetings per year
 
05:21:57.470 --> 05:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's for the acupuncture board I'm
 
05:21:59.628 --> 05:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
sure other boards are way different as
 
05:22:02.310 --> 05:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing this p last year if all five
 
05:22:04.430 --> 05:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
members attended all five sessions the
 
05:22:06.670 --> 05:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
highest amount would be
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
$625 unless this committee agrees that
 
05:22:10.990 --> 05:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
the following possible outcomes are
 
05:22:13.030 --> 05:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
beneficial such as loosening
 
05:22:14.788 --> 05:22:14.798 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards of Health Care
 
05:22:17.830 --> 05:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
improves Public Safety that removing an
 
05:22:19.750 --> 05:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board appear peers within a
 
05:22:21.350 --> 05:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
profession then turns the
 
05:22:23.150 --> 05:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
decision-making process to a body that
 
05:22:25.150 --> 05:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
does not fully understand the extent of
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
Education and Training necessary to be
 
05:22:30.910 --> 05:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
safe and effective practitioner and if 5
 
05:22:34.670 --> 05:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
00 to $625 is an extreme cost for board
 
05:22:38.830 --> 05:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
oversight then you must oppose hb1
 
05:22:42.150 --> 05:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
1676 FN thank you for your attention to
 
05:22:46.750 --> 05:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
this matter very respectfully Jody
 
05:22:50.868 --> 05:22:50.878 align:start position:0%
any questions representative manui thank
 
05:22:53.628 --> 05:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair a quick question how the
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
repeal of the board and repeal of
 
05:22:58.150 --> 05:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
Licensing would affect your
 
05:22:58.160 --> 05:22:59.868 align:start position:0%
Licensing would affect your
reimbursement

05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
structure thank you for that question um
 
05:23:07.390 --> 05:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
we are considered without a license
 
05:23:10.270 --> 05:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
insurance companies could not be paying
 
05:23:12.910 --> 05:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
us we would just be random people on the
 
05:23:16.150 --> 05:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
street doing our profession and not
 
05:23:18.230 --> 05:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
having any legitimacy in the insurance
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:25.110 --> 05:23:25.120 align:start position:0%

regulation of profession practice as
 
05:24:04.830 --> 05:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
we've heard in medicine design
 
05:24:08.270 --> 05:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
construction all exists not to pose a
 
05:24:10.910 --> 05:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
barrier to entry to the
 
05:24:14.510 --> 05:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
profession um or stake a Turf for some
 
05:24:18.788 --> 05:24:18.798 align:start position:0%

05:24:23.390 --> 05:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
education training and experience to
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
practice their profession and ensure the
 
05:24:28.430 --> 05:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
health safety and Welfare of the
 
05:24:32.230 --> 05:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state so that's the
 
05:24:35.470 --> 05:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
bottom line is that it's a police power
 
05:24:38.628 --> 05:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
that has been adopted in virtually every
 
05:24:40.990 --> 05:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
state for a variety of
 
05:24:43.868 --> 05:24:43.878 align:start position:0%
professions um including landscape
 
05:24:46.270 --> 05:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
architecture professional licensure
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
regulated by the state ensures that
 
05:24:51.390 --> 05:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
lenses have been found to be minimally
 
05:24:53.628 --> 05:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
competent to practice their profession
 
05:24:55.628 --> 05:24:55.638 align:start position:0%
is determined by education experience
 
05:24:55.638 --> 05:24:56.390 align:start position:0%
is determined by education experience
and

05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:58.350 --> 05:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
examination I'm proud to say that I've
 
05:25:01.070 --> 05:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
been found minimally competent in um in
 
05:25:05.628 --> 05:25:05.638 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 states of the United States um
 
05:25:09.230 --> 05:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
our board's rules permit simple rep
 
05:25:11.628 --> 05:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
reciprocity granted by administrative
 
05:25:13.830 --> 05:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
review if a practitioner is licensed in
 
05:25:15.590 --> 05:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
another jurisdiction with similar
 
05:25:17.510 --> 05:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements so that's no
 
05:25:19.708 --> 05:25:19.718 align:start position:0%
barrier to it's a it's a very simple
 
05:25:23.948 --> 05:25:23.958 align:start position:0%
process that occurs quickly uh without
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
needing to wait for a uh a meeting of
 
05:25:29.030 --> 05:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
the board Most states have requirements
 
05:25:31.670 --> 05:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
similar to New Hampshire so it's it is
 
05:25:34.670 --> 05:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
as I said very simple elimination of L
 
05:25:37.350 --> 05:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
insure would pose a burden on
 
05:25:39.030 --> 05:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
practitioners in New Hampshire since
 
05:25:41.110 --> 05:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
gaining those reciprocal licenses in
 
05:25:44.350 --> 05:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
other states we're a small region and we
 
05:25:46.750 --> 05:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
typically practice across state lines
 
05:25:49.990 --> 05:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
would be impossible it also would affect
 
05:25:52.110 --> 05:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire practitioners from
 
05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
being able to obtain uh insurance and uh
 
05:25:58.990 --> 05:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
and federal contracts for example U all
 
05:26:02.270 --> 05:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
of which require uh professional
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
licensure um in addition Market
 
05:26:11.110 --> 05:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
competition or civil action are uh poor
 
05:26:14.350 --> 05:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh methods of regulating professions
 
05:26:17.230 --> 05:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
since people need to be show harm in
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
order to have any any action take place
 
05:26:22.910 --> 05:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
and the goal here is to prevent
 
05:26:22.920 --> 05:26:24.430 align:start position:0%
and the goal here is to prevent
harm

05:26:24.430 --> 05:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
harm
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
um so notwithstanding testimony we've
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
heard today HB 16 76 requires
 
05:26:35.230 --> 05:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
elimination of licenses for a variety of
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
professionals on a on a rolling basis
 
05:26:39.350 --> 05:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
over the next seven years starting July
 
05:26:43.030 --> 05:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
1 2025 irrespective of the findings of
 
05:26:45.310 --> 05:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
the commission so the commission may do
 
05:26:48.310 --> 05:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
their work make findings but the
 
05:26:50.030 --> 05:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
commission is not responsible to make
 
05:26:51.390 --> 05:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
05:26:55.910 --> 05:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
law this body is responsible to make
 
05:26:59.830 --> 05:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
changes to law and I stopped predicting
 
05:27:02.628 --> 05:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
the actions of the legislature a long
 
05:27:07.830 --> 05:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
long time ago so I urge the uh the the
 
05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
committee to find HP 1676 inexpedient to
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
legislate uh please do not approve this
 
05:27:17.628 --> 05:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
abreg of the state's responsibility to
 
05:27:19.430 --> 05:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
protect the health safety and Welfare of
 
05:27:21.708 --> 05:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
its citizens thank you very much for
 
05:27:23.350 --> 05:27:23.360 align:start position:0%

answer any questions you might have are
 
05:27:29.150 --> 05:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:31.990 --> 05:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you

attorney at The Institute for for J

Justice uh thank you for the opportunity
 
05:28:08.868 --> 05:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
to voice my colleagues and my support
 
05:28:10.868 --> 05:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
for this very this important piece of
 
05:28:14.230 --> 05:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
legislation House Bill
 
05:28:18.270 --> 05:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
1676 Sunset reviews are not
 
05:28:21.548 --> 05:28:21.558 align:start position:0%
new they have existed since the early
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
1970s but to a large extent they have
 
05:28:24.000 --> 05:28:24.990 align:start position:0%
1970s but to a large extent they have
been

05:28:24.990 --> 05:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:28:30.110 --> 05:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
impotent because the status quo prevails
 
05:28:31.948 --> 05:28:31.958 align:start position:0%
and it's it's for that reason that
 
05:28:34.910 --> 05:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative leakas is right to
 
05:28:37.948 --> 05:28:37.958 align:start position:0%
include put the burden on those
 
05:28:41.830 --> 05:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
advocating for the status status quo
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
when you pass a crime a a a new crime
 
05:28:49.310 --> 05:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
law when you pass a new tort law you
 
05:28:52.830 --> 05:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
identify who has the burden of proof in
 
05:28:55.750 --> 05:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
criminal law you put that burden on the
 
05:28:57.830 --> 05:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
government that you say that the
 
05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
government must prove Beyond reasonable
 
05:29:04.230 --> 05:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
doubt that the person did the crime in a
 
05:29:07.628 --> 05:29:07.638 align:start position:0%
tort you put that that in a civil action
 
05:29:10.390 --> 05:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
you put that burden on the government by
 
05:29:10.400 --> 05:29:11.150 align:start position:0%
you put that burden on the government by
a

05:29:11.150 --> 05:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:29:16.230 --> 05:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:21.070 --> 05:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
51% at the core of this bill is New
 
05:29:24.548 --> 05:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's constitutional right to
 
05:29:30.510 --> 05:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
obtain happiness in article in Article 2
 
05:29:33.270 --> 05:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
of part one of your
 
05:29:36.150 --> 05:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution obtaining happiness is that
 
05:29:39.750 --> 05:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
Jeffers matoni and I Jeffersonian idea
 
05:29:43.590 --> 05:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
of realizing one's full po potential and
 
05:29:45.310 --> 05:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
you recognized it I don't know if you
 
05:29:47.350 --> 05:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
did it before Madison or you did it or
 
05:29:49.110 --> 05:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
Jefferson but you did it a or whether
 
05:29:51.310 --> 05:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
you did it after Madison and Jefferson
 
05:29:53.830 --> 05:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
but you recognize the importance of
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
one's entering the labor market entering
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
being able to work being able to pursue
 
05:30:04.030 --> 05:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
the their career and so it follows that
 
05:30:07.150 --> 05:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
the burden should be on those
 
05:30:09.948 --> 05:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
obstructing that right for those that
 
05:30:13.110 --> 05:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
who want to infringe upon those those
 
05:30:15.788 --> 05:30:15.798 align:start position:0%
rights who want to make it more
 
05:30:18.548 --> 05:30:18.558 align:start position:0%
difficult to to
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
work so the burden should be on those
 
05:30:24.190 --> 05:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
who are advocating
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
now Most states do what this what some
 
05:30:31.270 --> 05:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
testifiers have suggested don't have
 
05:30:34.430 --> 05:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
that default that's in this bill but
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
Texas does and so does Ohio in Texas
 
05:30:42.628 --> 05:30:42.638 align:start position:0%
this over it was put in in 1977 and over
 
05:30:45.150 --> 05:30:45.160 align:start position:0%
that that time the CPAs have come before
 
05:30:48.310 --> 05:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
the Texas uh Sunset commission and had
 
05:30:52.030 --> 05:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
their bill their their license renewed
 
05:30:57.708 --> 05:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
three times and so the one should be
 
05:31:02.310 --> 05:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
temperate in believing that this is the
 
05:31:03.750 --> 05:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
end of the
 
05:31:06.948 --> 05:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
world and to that extent let me thank
 
05:31:10.670 --> 05:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative ghoul for pointing out on
 
05:31:15.868 --> 05:31:15.878 align:start position:0%
page two line 35 and 36 the word on line
 
05:31:17.788 --> 05:31:17.798 align:start position:0%
35 the word
 
05:31:21.548 --> 05:31:21.558 align:start position:0%
or on line 35 reads reflects other
 
05:31:24.868 --> 05:31:24.878 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the legislature or
 
05:31:28.628 --> 05:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
make no cha no changes so this is a
 
05:31:32.948 --> 05:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
process bill it it puts in front of this
 
05:31:36.030 --> 05:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
Commission on a regular
 
05:31:39.670 --> 05:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
basis the review the
 
05:31:44.708 --> 05:31:44.718 align:start position:0%
review of certain certain regulations
 
05:31:48.310 --> 05:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
with no implied the word or does not
 
05:31:53.868 --> 05:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
imply Destiny it implies Flex
 
05:31:57.750 --> 05:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility no board no law should be a
 
05:32:00.670 --> 05:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
sacred cow and reviewing them
 
05:32:04.150 --> 05:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
periodically is very very important let
 
05:32:07.708 --> 05:32:07.718 align:start position:0%
me go to my second and final point which
 
05:32:11.470 --> 05:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
is what this bill does particularly well
 
05:32:14.470 --> 05:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
is say that you do not live in a binary
 
05:32:17.350 --> 05:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
world you do not live in a world of
 
05:32:22.390 --> 05:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
license versus no Li Li license you do
 
05:32:25.350 --> 05:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
not live in a world of binary world of
 
05:32:30.350 --> 05:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
exist aboard exist or doesn't exist you
 
05:32:34.270 --> 05:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill does on page number two
 
05:32:36.990 --> 05:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
is point out that you live in a world in
 
05:32:40.390 --> 05:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
which you have lots of regulatory
 
05:32:44.750 --> 05:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
choices on p on line nine you could let
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
Market forces you could let Yelp and
 
05:32:52.270 --> 05:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
other review and reputation and word of
 
05:32:56.270 --> 05:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
Word of Mouth be the regulatory force on
 
05:33:00.150 --> 05:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
line 25 you could let occupational
 
05:33:03.830 --> 05:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
licenses be the regulatory force and
 
05:33:06.990 --> 05:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
between those two lines you have lots of
 
05:33:12.270 --> 05:33:12.280 align:start position:0%
choices let me point out line 17 on page
 
05:33:16.470 --> 05:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
two and line 18 the regulation of
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
facilities where specific goods or
 
05:33:20.110 --> 05:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
services is
 
05:33:22.750 --> 05:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
sold and
 
05:33:25.948 --> 05:33:25.958 align:start position:0%
inspections the radical thing of putting
 
05:33:31.190 --> 05:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
food in your mouth at restaurants is not
 
05:33:35.230 --> 05:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
regulated by an occupational license The
 
05:33:40.350 --> 05:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
Cook the chef the bus boy the purchasing
 
05:33:43.350 --> 05:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
agent does not need to be licensed in
 
05:33:46.868 --> 05:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
the state of of New Hampshire instead
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
your municipalities regularly inspect
 
05:33:55.270 --> 05:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants and that is the right
 
05:33:58.548 --> 05:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
proportional type of reg regulation that
 
05:34:00.390 --> 05:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
should exist for
 
05:34:03.350 --> 05:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
restaurants and what it invites you what
 
05:34:06.190 --> 05:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
this bill does it invites the commission
 
05:34:10.510 --> 05:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
to think about what is the proportional
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
type of Regulation to those risks and it
 
05:34:16.470 --> 05:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
does it in a very important
 
05:34:20.270 --> 05:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
way much is often said of cost benefit
 
05:34:23.070 --> 05:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
analysis but the problem is there's just
 
05:34:26.750 --> 05:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
not enough data that exists as to what
 
05:34:29.990 --> 05:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
the costs are for certain license what
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
the benefits are for certain license and
 
05:34:36.510 --> 05:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
so what that tends to do it tends to
 
05:34:40.110 --> 05:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
invite advocates for licensing to come
 
05:34:45.070 --> 05:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
forward with exaggerated anecdotes and
 
05:34:49.110 --> 05:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated points about health and
 
05:34:51.750 --> 05:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
safety you're very experienced
 
05:34:54.590 --> 05:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
legislators you know the problem of
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
public Cho choice where those with
 
05:35:01.510 --> 05:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
concentrated benefits show up this
 
05:35:07.628 --> 05:35:07.638 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is a vehicle for your
 
05:35:10.628 --> 05:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
review in ways that are
 
05:35:14.430 --> 05:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
systematic that allow that ensure that
 
05:35:17.590 --> 05:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
the problems of regulatory capture and
 
05:35:21.510 --> 05:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
public Choice are not overly overly
 
05:35:27.708 --> 05:35:27.718 align:start position:0%
influ influential to and stop Granite
 
05:35:31.270 --> 05:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
Staters from pursuing their they're
 
05:35:31.280 --> 05:35:33.510 align:start position:0%
Staters from pursuing their they're
calling

05:35:33.510 --> 05:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
calling
 
05:35:37.708 --> 05:35:37.718 align:start position:0%
finally Mr chairman members what this
 
05:35:42.070 --> 05:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill also does on page three on
 
05:35:44.590 --> 05:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
line8 is to
 
05:35:49.470 --> 05:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
invite the commission to seek expertise
 
05:35:53.830 --> 05:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
on antitrust law occupational licensing
 
05:35:55.830 --> 05:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
the Federal Trade Commission sued the
 
05:35:58.670 --> 05:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
the North Carolina Dental Board in
 
05:36:02.390 --> 05:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
2014 and it and the Supreme Court found
 
05:36:05.150 --> 05:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
that occupational licensing boards can
 
05:36:08.788 --> 05:36:08.798 align:start position:0%
be problematic because they can be
 
05:36:12.670 --> 05:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
captured and participants on that board
 
05:36:17.190 --> 05:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
can extend their their Authority beyond
 
05:36:19.628 --> 05:36:19.638 align:start position:0%
what has been delegated to them by the
 
05:36:22.350 --> 05:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
legislature and that exposes that
 
05:36:24.548 --> 05:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
exposed the state of North Carolina and
 
05:36:28.110 --> 05:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
by proxy the state of uh of new New
 
05:36:30.590 --> 05:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to
 
05:36:33.510 --> 05:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
litigation I submit to you that this is
 
05:36:38.830 --> 05:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
a moderate process bill that puts the
 
05:36:44.110 --> 05:36:44.120 align:start position:0%
right burden on those on the status
 
05:36:48.070 --> 05:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
quo but it's a burden of only 51% of the
 
05:36:48.080 --> 05:36:49.230 align:start position:0%
quo but it's a burden of only 51% of the
400

05:36:49.230 --> 05:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
400
 
05:36:52.910 --> 05:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
members it is not a big it is not a big
 
05:36:55.628 --> 05:36:55.638 align:start position:0%
burden and there are plenty of people
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
available to to
 
05:36:58.600 --> 05:37:01.430 align:start position:0%
available to to
support

05:37:01.430 --> 05:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:37:04.868 --> 05:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
the renewal of regulations when they are
 
05:37:07.110 --> 05:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed and
