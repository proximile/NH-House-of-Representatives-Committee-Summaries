said you know you're going to have to
 
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
session this is going to be a little
 
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
challenging to keep this moving because
 
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.750 align:start position:0%
challenging to keep this moving because
these

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:53.589 align:start position:0%
these
guys

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 align:start position:0%
sent me a text this morning saying U
 
00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
good morning I'll be in at some point to
 
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
remove stuff from the office she doesn't
 
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:28.670 align:start position:0%
 
things

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.550 align:start position:0%
 
bills

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.710 align:start position:0%
 
start

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
need right good morning everyone the
 
00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
time being 9:33 we'll get started with
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
the work
 
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
session and I'm going to open the work
 
00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 align:start position:0%
session first for
 
00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:28.590 align:start position:0%
session first for
HB

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.310 align:start position:0%
 
1514

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 align:start position:0%
and while we will cover each bill
 
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
individually I do expect that there may
 
00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 align:start position:0%
be some crossover here the I've listed
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
the first three bills the first three
 
00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
education bills um 1514 1563 and
 
00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.749 align:start position:0%
education bills um 1514 1563 and
1517

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
1517
 
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
um while we have uh some representatives
 
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
from education and
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
doj um and
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
also HB 1655 which is listed a little
 
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
further down the page here um we'll
 
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
probably I'll probably pull that further
 
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
up while we have those same members here
 
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
at the same time so they don't have to
 
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
1655 okay do I first do we have any
 
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
1514 CH yes representative
 
00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 align:start position:0%
PL to me this is is going to have to
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
happen uh be right now I I believe the
 
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh swept we keeping the uh letting the
 
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
towns keep in excess is probably
 
00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional my only question is
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
whether it has to happen now or part of
 
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.110 align:start position:0%
whether it has to happen now or part of
a

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh plan uh come coming out
 
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
of a special committee set up to handle
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property uh no
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide funding of uh School schooling
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
education what so whether the timing is
 
00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
question it it may make sense for me to
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
call up Mr Garland uh from the
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
um doj to
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
get some information as much as he can
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
give on where we stand um in general um
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot going on with this
 
00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.390 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot going on with this
issue

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.469 align:start position:0%
issue
obviously

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
there we go thats all right um all right
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um I'm here from the
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice my name is Sam
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
Garland I'm um senior Assistant Attorney
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
General there and I've been involved as
 
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
a litigator in the school funding cases
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
we currently have pending um and as
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative Janan noted there are
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
some things I I certainly can't talk
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
about we're in the middle of of that
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
litigation and and I can't you know
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
weigh in on on certain aspects of of
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
of that but I can provide if it'd be
 
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
helpful to the committee an overview of
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
where we stand in the litigation there
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
are two cases and and I think um they
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
they focus on distinct things um and and
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
where the process currently stands and
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
and you know the rulings that we've
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
received from the trial court so far if
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
beneficial um so so there's uh a case
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's colloquially colloquially known
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
as conal it's kukuk Valley School
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
District it's it's the older of the two
 
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
it was filed in 2019 and that case is
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
focused principally on base adequacy so
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
that's um the amount that's in
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
1984a I believe is the is the statute um
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
and it's the per pupil cost there so
 
00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:38.879 align:start position:0%
that's not focused on the swept issue
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
that we're we're talking about today
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's focused on um the the the base
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
adequacy amount um we had a trial in May
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh and judge rof the superior court
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
judge has uh has declared that the
 
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
amount that's currently in the statute
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional it's not sufficient
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
to fund an adequate education as as he
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
viewed it um he has also directed
 
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
payments be made uh to to a higher
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
amount that he identified in his order
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
um that matter is currently um there's a
 
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
motion to stay that portion of the order
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
pending at the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
Court um and and that motion remains
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
pending um and we've represented
 
00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
publicly that that the state does intend
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
to appeal the ruling to the New
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court to get to the
 
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to weigh in definitively
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
on on on the issues in that case and so
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
that appeal will be forthcoming in in
 
00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:25.879 align:start position:0%
the next couple of weeks and then it
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
will be briefed and it will take um
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
likely several months for the brief and
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
an argument and resolution of that case
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
um there's also a case that's uh that's
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
Steve Rand versus State of New Hampshire
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
that case also has um an adequacy
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
component to it that is still pending in
 
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919 align:start position:0%
the trial court but it also took um it
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
had a claim that directly focused on the
 
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
swept and it it made the argument that
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
because towns um there there really two
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
arguments but but the main one um being
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
that because towns are allowed to retain
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
excess swept uh under the current
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
statutory regime which which reflects an
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
amendment in 2011 that allowed that to
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
occur um that violates part two Article
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
5 of The Constitution um because it's
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
not an equal or proportional tax and so
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
we brief that on Cross motions for
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
summary judgment just arguments by
 
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
lawyers on on the legal arguments there
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
um and the same judge judge rth has um
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
has agreed with the plaintiffs that the
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
swept as currently administered is
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um the there is a
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
coalition of uh of towns um former donor
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
towns that that intervened in that case
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
they've already filed a notice of appeal
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme cour Court um we are
 
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
likely to appeal that case as well um
 
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
there's no motion to stay at the Supreme
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
Court currently pending in that case um
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
and so that case is really the one that
 
00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
focuses most directly on the issues that
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
that I think the bills in front of you
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
today are concerned with which is the
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
question of the Statewide education
 
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
property tax um and and really for for
 
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
at least 1514 I believe um the the
 
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
question of excess funds um uh and as I
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
understand it 1514 would go back to a
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
world that is pre 20101 that would have
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
the any excess funds um be remitted to
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund um where they
 
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
would be um you know they they that they
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
would be reallocated in some way under
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
under the legislation and so the the law
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
would shipped back to a world that that
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
um existed prior to
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
2011 I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
that that thank you that was helpful um
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Aly uh I'd just like to
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
make a slight correction I think we put
 
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
in what was repealed in in 2011 we put
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
in around
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
2008 um it was was a a late Improvement
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
and it I believe it it was why the New
 
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court decided to
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
scrutiny which is what allowed 2011 to
 
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:56.839 align:start position:0%
happen going
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
backwards representative PL
 
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps you could aine on the
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
question I asked whether we should pass
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
this now or wait for more comprehensive
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
solution coming out of a special
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
committee sorry representative um I
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to interrupt you um I I'm
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
not comfortable opining on that specific
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
question um I can provide some context
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
for it I I do think the question whether
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
to uh whether to go forward with
 
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
specific legislation is really uniquely
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
Within your per perview to to think
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
about and it's something that from kind
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
of a litigation standpoint I'm I'm
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable um providing you know
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
specific opinion or advice on that what
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
I will say is uh the swept issue that's
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
identified in Rand is a specific issue
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
that that didn't come up in conal it's a
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
question about how the tax is
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
administered um representative Aly is
 
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
exactly right and I did leave out that
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
that previous context not um not
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
deliberately which is that when the
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
swept was was created basically when it
 
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
when it went from a state education
 
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
property tax to the Statewide education
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
property tax it was part of a holistic
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
um reassessment of of the education laws
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
in the state that occurred in 2008 uh in
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
in and around the londonairy um
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
litigation that happened then so it
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
didn't happen in isolation then but it
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
is a specific question that's uh that is
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
raised only in one of the two cases that
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
are currently
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
pending representative
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
Ames good morning
 
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
um I've got I have a couple of questions
 
00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:34.839 align:start position:0%
but first I'm surprised that there's no
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
stay uh being requested for the Rand
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
case and um what is the
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
what there's an an order for immediate
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
action in that case as I understand it
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
um and um no request for a stay is there
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
time for a request for a stay still or
 
00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:00.069 align:start position:0%
time for a request for a stay still or
what

00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
what what should be done in the meantime
 
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely so again I I I have to be
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
careful not to get into kind of the
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
legal strategic thinking um or or or
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
divulge work product or or attorney
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
client Communications what what I can
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
say about the issue in Rand is we we did
 
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
move for a stay in the trial court which
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
the trial court denied um it was a
 
00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
motion that was joined by the Coalition
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
or the Coalition filed a similar motion
 
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
that the trial court considered and
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
rejected the coalition has filed the
 
00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
appeal and um it is represent it
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
represents a group of towns that I think
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
have a perspective that's different from
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
the really Dr but the state more
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
generally on the administrative um
 
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
burdens with respect to changing uh the
 
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
the current way that the swept is
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
administered for for Dr there are
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
certainly questions around that and and
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's something that we are
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
looking long and hard at for the appeal
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
and whether if there's a request for a
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
stay coming from the Coalition um you
 
00:13:58.829 --> 00:13:58.839 align:start position:0%
know what what our responses to that but
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
terms of how it affects uh particular
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal budgets how they that process
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
which which I know as you know plays out
 
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
over a matter of months and there's
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
significant um you know significant time
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
that needs to go into considering what
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue will be um and how
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to be allocated the
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
Coalition is in a position where it can
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
speak about that on a Town level in a
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
way that we can't um and so that that's
 
00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:23.759 align:start position:0%
not a direct answer to your question but
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
it but it kind of gets into a little bit
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
the order of operations that we are we
 
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
have here in the interest that
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
play okay well we'll leave that I'm
 
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959 align:start position:0%
sorry I um we'll leave that um it's all
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
pretty murky and we've got to work our
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
way through it in the meantime we've got
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
all these swep bills is is not just one
 
00:14:49.749 --> 00:14:49.759 align:start position:0%
um and um with regard to the swept bills
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
there is an additional bill that I think
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
I should mention as context that relates
 
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
both to conal and Rand that I just
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
learned about early this morning um
 
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
filed by representative
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
emerik um in a work session yesterday on
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
1583 which is one of the bills that
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
passed on the house floor I think a week
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
ago um providing
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
additional um an an increase in the
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
base number from 40 can't do the numbers
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
by about $200 or
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
$300 uh per pupil um and the amendment
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
by representative Emme which is uh
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
significant uh would increase the per
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
pupo base cost from
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
$4,100 to$
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
7,356 And1 which might bring a bell with
 
00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
7,356 And1 which might bring a bell with
you

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
um in the con Val case is that's the
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
very number that judge rof I believe um
 
00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
um came down upon and uh and then it
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
also raises swept from uh a tax that
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
produces $363 million to a tax that
 
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.829 align:start position:0%
produces $363 million to a tax that
produces

00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
produces
 
00:16:18.839 --> 00:16:20.629 align:start position:0%
produces
$773

00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
$773
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
million uh so
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
it I guess by my math that's more than
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
doubling the um amount produced by that
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
tax uh which I I understand would
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
result um I haven't checked this myself
 
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
but an an increase in excess
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
swept of about
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
uh uh $90
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
million so that's a background I that
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
may go nowhere but it's part of the
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
swirl of uh of
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh efforts to respond to this situation
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
I think that we've got to be aware of as
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
we go through this um and I don't really
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
expect I'm sorry to be commenting rather
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
than uh questioning I'm not sure it's
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
much you can say in response to this or
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
maybe you're aware of this
 
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
activity so representative Ames I I
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
became aware of of the actual bill this
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
morning as well uh it's not something
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
I've had even a chance to look at but my
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is the same as yours in
 
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
terms of of what it does what I can say
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
is I haven't studied it we haven't you
 
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
know had a chance to to think about what
 
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
effect it would have on the litigation
 
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
um but I as always would be happy to
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
come over if if this uh committee has a
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
has a work session or a hearing on it to
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
to weigh in uh where at a time where I
 
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
could be more prepared than I am today
 
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
but I am aware of it and it's something
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
we'll be keeping a close eye on as well
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay I I'll leave it at then I I have
 
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
copies of this amendment if I if I
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
should pass it out I will would you like
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
me to do that of the amendment to 1583
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
the 1583 the one I just spoke about okay
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
what committee is that in that's in
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
finance Finance
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
okay I pass around sure just just uh
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
course representative
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank taking my question um
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of context and perspective
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
so if we do pass these bills um the
 
00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:39.799 align:start position:0%
legislators making a point or taking a
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
stand or whatever um but everything can
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
still be appealed so I'm I'm just
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
wondering whether we pass these bills or
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
not um it seems like it will end up in
 
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.350 align:start position:0%
not um it seems like it will end up in
the

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
court it's certainly possible
 
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.310 align:start position:0%
court it's certainly possible
representative

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
um so so one thing that I haven't
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
assessed and wouldn't feel comfortable
 
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
weighing in on now is whether if these
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
bills passed or ultimately the bill that
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
representative Ames just spoke to um
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
whether that would what effect it would
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
have on the litigation and ultimately
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
the question would be you know would it
 
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
moot the litigation or would it change
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
um the likelihood of appeal that's a
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
complicated question it's more
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
complicated than than it might seem at
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
first blush and we'd really have to dig
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
into that um what I'll say more
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
generally is
 
00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:26.549 align:start position:0%
generally is
um

00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
that there there's a there's a
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
significant question that I think has
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
existed in in this line of decisions for
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
a very long time between you know the
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
Court's role and and school funding and
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
the legislator's role um and it's a
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
question that is really Central to every
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
one of of these cases and so the legisl
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
and it goes a bit to to representative
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
jian's question at at the beginning um
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
or maybe it was representative pl's
 
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799 align:start position:0%
about uh whether to move forward with
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
let litigation or legislation while the
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know the cases are out there and and
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
what I would would say to that is the
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
the litigation responds to the
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
legislation but but this is a body that
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
you know that is a separate body from
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
the the court system that has to
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
consider the policy implications and and
 
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
and the positions it wants to take
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
separate from that is I shouldn't say it
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
has to but that that's kind of my
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
perspective on it is they are separate
 
00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:16.470 align:start position:0%
perspective on it is they are separate
and

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
um they're distinct they're related but
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
distinct that's helpful thank
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
you representative fellows thank you Mr
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm not a lawyer
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
but I did read you know some the some of
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
the conval decision and the Rand
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
decision and my um perspective of the
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
Rand decision was that the well actually
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
the judge had two had two cases and when
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
he made a ruling on the Rand case it
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
seemed to me that he was taking it
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
strictly from the perspective of this is
 
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.830 align:start position:0%
strictly from the perspective of this is
a

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
tax and because all of his um arguments
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
and reasons for his decision were based
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
on tax law and not they didn't it didn't
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
seem to be tied to the fact that the
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
swep is a major component in the Aid
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
distribution so I'm wondering if
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
this the swept that is used as part of
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
the calculation for adequacy Aid if it
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
were not not revenue from a
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
tax would
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
that mean
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
that it would not be in conflict with
 
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
the judges ruling in the Rand case
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question and it's one
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
that I I candidly and I know this is a
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
lawyerly response I don't have an answer
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
to I mean so the the way that Revenue
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
has been generated um or at least the
 
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.350 align:start position:0%
has been generated um or at least the
State

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
education component of educa of of
 
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
of um so the non I should say that the
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
tax the tax revenue has been generated
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
has been through a a property tax the
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
State education property tax the
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax and
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
because it is generate it is that revenu
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
is generated as a tax it's subject to
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
the restrictions in the state
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
constitution um that surround taxes so
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
part two Article 5 being the principle
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
one that's focused on that's equal and
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
proportionate taxation um there's never
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
been a case that that I'm aware of
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's tested other Revenue sources and
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
and you know the Constitutional
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
constraints on those Revenue sources for
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
funding education and so I I would be
 
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
really speculating and and and I I I
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that and so I know it's
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
a non-answer to your question but the
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
reason that that the case so far has
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
focused just on on taxing and the in the
 
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
constraints on taxing power is because
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
that is the the revenue source that it
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
has been the primary revenue source for
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
time just is it's not really a followup
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
um I get confused between when the
 
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
statement that you made about the where
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
all the the two bills are um the
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
difference the Rand case is that was
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
appealed to the superior court judge and
 
00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:17.909 align:start position:0%
appealed to the superior court judge and
he

00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
said you know I I'm not going to change
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
my mind basically and has that what is
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
the status of that right now has it been
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
appealed to the Supreme Court I I don't
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know all the terminology absolutely
 
00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:36.919 align:start position:0%
um so both of the cases conal and Rand
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
were filed in the superior court so they
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
were lawsuits filed by plaintiffs in the
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
Superior Court bringing constitutional
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
claims um in in conval which had been
 
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
pending since 2019 has been to the
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court once we had a trial um
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
last May and we got an order in that
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
case that that was focused on adequacy
 
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
and so that's not the Rand case and we
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
moved to reconsider part of that order
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
order um and move to stay the order with
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
the superior court and and the judge
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
denied that and so now there's a motion
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
pending at the Supreme Court asking the
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court while an appeal is pending
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the conval case um to put the trial
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
Court's order on hold that that's the
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
payment um of of adequacy amounts in the
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
increased amount he identified in his
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
order the Rand case also was filed in
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and it has two Port parts
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
of it one part is also an adequacy claim
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
that has some similarities to the conval
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
case that hasn't been resolved that that
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
that claim is still out there the one
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
that has been resolved is just focused
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
on on the swept it was kind of litigated
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
separately within the same case focused
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
just on the on the tax uh portion of it
 
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
and and the procedure there was the
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
parties agreed that whether the tax was
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
constitutional was really just a legal
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
question it didn't require that we go
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
have a trial where Witnesses got on the
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
stand and spoke to factual questions
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
because it was really a question of how
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Provisions applied to
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
the statute as it's written and as it
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
operates and the judge uh ruled ruled in
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
a in a written order um that the swept
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
as it currently operates is not
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional and so then we move to
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
reconsider and stay that decision as
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
well with the the same judge he he
 
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
declined to reconsider his decision or
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
stay it and so now that is up at the
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court as well um through a a
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
coalition of former donor towns so
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
they're both at the Supreme Court
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
they're just in slightly different
 
00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:20.919 align:start position:0%
postures in their separate cases I may
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
have just made it more confusing I
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
apologize but
 
00:25:23.679 --> 00:25:25.510 align:start position:0%
apologize but
um

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
okay representative spillsbury
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
being here Mr Garland very helpful uh
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to lay out what I think is a
 
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
distinction in the status of the two
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
cases and see if I'm getting this right
 
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
so if you could U give me your
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
feedback in the case of the uh in the
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
Rand case the question regarding swept
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
is essentially whether there's a
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional flaw in the way that
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's currently distributed
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
specifically with the excess and if the
 
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
judge was uh to stick with this
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion and it and it uh uh was
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
supported by the Supreme Court then
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
effectively we would have a declaration
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
of an unconstitutional law and our hand
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
would be forced as a legislature to do
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
something to correct
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
that we may in our judgment want to do
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
that sooner we may in our judgment want
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
to wait till the appeal is settled But
 
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately our hand would be forced if
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
the the uh Superior Court judge's
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
opinion is sustained is that correct I
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
think that's a fair way to assess it
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
what what's happened in past school
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
funding cases and so I'm talking about
 
00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
the Claremont decisions in London der is
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
if the Supreme Court were to ultimately
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
affirm a decision that the current tax
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional it would provide
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
time for for for this body to consider
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
ways to address the unconstitutionality
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
and that's a little wrinkle that exists
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
right now but I think your assessment is
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
um May ultimately be forced but is not
 
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily forced yet the trial Court's
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
decision is subject to to the normal
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
appeal and and that that's up at the
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court now so second part in in
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
contrast to that the conal
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
case involves uh a much more probative
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh set of testimony and findings on the
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
part of the superior court judge to
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
reach a conclusion not just that an
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
adequate education has to be provided
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
but what actual amount of funding it
 
00:27:36.669 --> 00:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
would take to do that and so you said uh
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
earlier uh in in your
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that um a good bit of this is
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
uniquely in the province of the
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
legislature and I think it's a major
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
component of
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
your um motion for stay
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I anticipate in your
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
appeal that that the Superior Court
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
exceeded its
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
Authority by getting into a uniquely
 
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.350 align:start position:0%
Authority by getting into a uniquely
legislative

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
matter and so uh of course we'll hear uh
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
from the uh supreme court on that as
 
00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
well but um do you have any
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts in terms of protecting the
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
rationale of your appeal about how far
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature should go before the
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
appeal is settled or should we be
 
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.350 align:start position:0%
appeal is settled or should we be
patient

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
um I'm not comfortable opining or
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
providing advice specifically in
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
response to that question so I apologize
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
I think that that is kind of a
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
distinction between between your body as
 
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
a legislative body the court as a court
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
system and us as an executive branch
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
agency what I will say though um and and
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
hopefully this uh this at least in part
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
response to your question um is that
 
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
there are multiple components of the
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
conval decision it's it's it's a pretty
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
nuanced decision it focuses on both a
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
request for declaratory relief so that's
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
a a call to the court to say say this
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
law is unconstitutional um and it also
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
requests for injunctive relief which is
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
okay this law is unconstitutional now
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
the court is going to direct um the the
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
government in some way whether it be the
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislative branch the the the executive
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
branch or or someone else um to do
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
something and so there there is there in
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
both of those ports
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
both of those um forms of relief exist
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
in in the trial Court's order and so the
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
focus of the motion to stay that we
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
filed earlier this week was on the
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
latter the latter uh form of relief the
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
the injunction that a uh payment to the
 
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
in the amount that the that uh Court
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
identified in its order happen while the
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
appeals pending um we haven't asked uh I
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
guess we've asked technically to stay
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
the Declaration but that declaration
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
would ultimately be subject to Supreme
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
Court re viw no matter what and the
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court would weigh in and in the
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
end of the day would say yes it's right
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
or no it's wrong but the thing that
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
would um have an a more direct impact on
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
state finances while the appeal is
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
pending if it's not State as the
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
injunction component I know that's not a
 
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
direct answer to your question but it's
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
a Nuance in the case that I wanted the
 
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
flag um thank you for the followup no
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's a very good answer because quite
 
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
frankly I posed the question in part to
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
learn what you would say and what you
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
felt you could say but also just food
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
for thought for my colleagues as we
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
consider the bills uh but uh I was
 
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.350 align:start position:0%
consider the bills uh but uh I was
particularly

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
struck uh by the comment in the motion
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
for stay that was filed yesterday about
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
the characterization of the injunctive
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
relief as reading more like a
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
legislative committee report than a
 
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.029 align:start position:0%
legislative committee report than a
Judicial

00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
Judicial
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
opinion and uh what that was getting at
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
I think is injunctions are more commonly
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
used to order that something not occur
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
but this was much more adventurous in
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
the sense that the superior court judge
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
used the injunctive power to compel
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
action on the part of the legislature
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be I think the key
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
question that the Supreme Court will
 
00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
have to decide and and my my response to
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
that generally speaking is that uh it's
 
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
an important question that arises
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
frequently in school funding decisions
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
right it is the Supreme Court has
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
acknowledged uh and and the trial court
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
did here too and and I do want I don't
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
want to overlook that that setting
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
education policy is largely within the
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
province of the legislature the question
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
is um and it's a question that's that
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
has been litigated for for the past 30
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
years is what role does the Judiciary in
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
in addressing the constitutional right
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution um to to provide an
 
00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
adequate education have in you know
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
curtailing what this body does or
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
directing what this body does it's not
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
unique to this case it's a question
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
that's come up throughout this uh this
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
the the Decades of litigation around
 
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
this issue and so I I don't want to
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
leave um this body with with the
 
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion that that that's not an issue
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
that that's come up before and it's a
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
question that ultimately the Supreme
 
00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
Court will have to weigh in on and has
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
in the past as well understood thank you
 
00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:18.430 align:start position:0%
in the past as well understood thank you
very

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
Ames uh one one um aspect of the
 
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:30.039 align:start position:0%
litigation that's been ongoing
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
for 30 years or so
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
the way in which the state meets its
 
00:32:43.629 --> 00:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
declared Duty the the duty that was
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
declared in the CL first Claremont
 
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.669 align:start position:0%
declared in the CL first Claremont
decision

00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
1993 um
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
to provide to every child an adequate
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
educa an opportunity for an adequate
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
education um
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
and the the part of the Court's
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
declaration or or holding in in that
 
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
first case was that the state must then
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee as part of its Duty guarantee
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
funding for that adequate education
 
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
that's what they said as a quote here um
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
and they Ed the word
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
guarantee and it was only in later cases
 
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
that uh as I looked at them that were
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
not directly on the question of how the
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
state would meet that obligation to
 
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.149 align:start position:0%
state would meet that obligation to
guarantee

00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
00:33:33.159 --> 00:33:35.029 align:start position:0%
guarantee
funding

00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
um only in the later cases that that
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
became a state tax or state raised money
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
that would be the way in which the state
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
would um comply with its obligation to
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
guarantee funding and um so all Focus
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
has been on in in the adequacy
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
discussions I've been involved in has
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
been on how the state will raise the
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
money and um excluded from that
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
discussion is is local money uh local
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
property taxes so it's a 100% State
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
money whether it's from the lottery or
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
from uh various state taxes including
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
the Statewide property tax properly
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
administered um that would meet that
 
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:31.079 align:start position:0%
obligation 100% in our sister State our
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
state next door uh Massachusetts there's
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
been similar litigation and in that case
 
00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:40.599 align:start position:0%
they've developed a system where the uh
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
a part of their Duty it's the same
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional phrase that's been
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
interpreted in both cases are
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
essentially the same um has been
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
fulfilled by a
 
00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:55.510 align:start position:0%
fulfilled by a
uh

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
uniform um
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
contribution by localities to meet part
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
of that cost of what they don't call it
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
inadequate education it's a
 
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
foundation um foundational education I
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
guess um and I don't see that issue
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
raised it seems to me as something that
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
you could raise the judge is certainly
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh come down very clearly on the side
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
that the state's duty is to pay 100% of
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
whatever it defines as adequacy and I
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of back and forth
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
you've argued that he's done it wrong in
 
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.670 align:start position:0%
you've argued that he's done it wrong in
terms

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
terms
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
costing adequacy both on both sides of
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
that um and uh so but but there has been
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
no suggestion that I can see or argument
 
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
um that would push towards hey maybe
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
this is a joint enter pris that we're
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
engaged in um both the local school
 
00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.109 align:start position:0%
engaged in um both the local school
districts

00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities on one side and the and
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature of the state on the
 
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
other side and um and look at it that
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
way I think there's good arguments that
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
can be made and um it uh it would
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
essentially um recognize the fact that
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
our local school districts are contrib
 
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
buting already a significant amount
 
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
towards the education of our children
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
and uh and that that all should be
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
counted could be counted in a more
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
comprehensive consideration of the uh of
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
the issue we have um a bill before us
 
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
that uh introduces the concept
 
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.230 align:start position:0%
that uh introduces the concept
representative

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
fellows um offered it um that we've got
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with that uh has the local
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
contribution Concept in it as one of the
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
components of the source of funding for
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
an adequate education and another bill
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's in education which is a product
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
of the work of the uh uh Commission on
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
school funding in the 2022 I think um
 
00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
and that bill too has a local
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
contribution as a significant component
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
of the way in which adequacy is to pay
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
be paid for so I I don't expect you to
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
say yeah we're going to be arguing that
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
because you know that you're you're
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
figuring all this out but I'd really
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
like to see that and uh if you don't
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
think that argument should be made I'd
 
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
certainly like to hear that response and
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh know that that's where you stand on
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
it so I don't want to get out over my
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
skis and and I I really shouldn't um uh
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
on ter in terms of what we're going to
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
put into our notice of appeal it's still
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
not due for a couple of weeks um what I
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
will say I guess I I have two things I
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
would say in response to that um the
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
first is that conal is
 
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:09.079 align:start position:0%
um I'm no it is colv Val is the first
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
case that will go to the Supreme Court
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
that's focused um on the costing s
 
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
portion of of the state's Duty so uh
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
you're quite right representative Ames
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
that the first case Claremont one
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
focused on does the duty exists what is
 
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
it um and then over time the Supreme
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
Court our Supreme Court identified
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
components to that Duty so um a lot of
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
cases were focused or a number of cases
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
at the beginning on what's the
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
definition and whether the definition
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
that the legislature adopted was
 
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient a number of other cases have
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
focused on the taxing mechanism and
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's really what Rand does again as
 
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
well um but there isn't a case um it was
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
it was it existed in the londonairy case
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't Central to the Court's
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
resolution okay the way that it's being
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
costed and funded um by the state is
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
that constitutional and one of the
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
questions that's exist that exists in
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
this case and I think that the trial
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
court acknowledged it is okay if the
 
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
state has a duty to Define an adequate
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
education and in London da the Supreme
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
Court has said the state has an
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
obligation to fund that portion of of
 
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
that that that which it defines as a
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate education
 
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
where does the the local component come
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
into that where really is the line drawn
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
between the state obligation um and and
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
the local obligation and and what I can
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
say and this is not this has been um you
 
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
know reflected in our public filings in
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
the trial court is that you know we took
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
a particular position on that question
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
kind of where the line is is drawn and
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
the trial court disagreed with it so it
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
is an issue that's been raised in the
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
case and and the idea that localities do
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
have a role to play in funding education
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
I I don't think is meaningfully in
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
dispute in the case it's really what
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
portion of of of education does the
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
state have to cover within its
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligations so beyond
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
beyond that I'm not really comfortable
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
getting into the specific things that we
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
might raise in our notice of appeal but
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue that that has been
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
absent from the litigation th
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
you representative spillsbury Mr
 
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.950 align:start position:0%
you representative spillsbury Mr
chairman

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I want to Echo representative
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
am's comments I think they are hitting a
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
very important set of points and
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
certainly one that this committee is
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
going to have to deal
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
with so municipalities are a construct
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
of the state school districts are a
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
construct of the state the power to tax
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
real estate uh for the purposes of
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
supporting the municipal budget or the
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
county budget is a construct of the
 
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
state it does seem that the distinction
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
between so-called state level taxes and
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
local taxes is artificial as a
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional matter they're all
 
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
essentially the product of decisions
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
made at the state level furthermore we
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
tend to view the swept as a SE charge on
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
top of an existing base of local
 
00:40:59.230 --> 00:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
property proper tax and the fact that
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
both the local Ed and the state Ed are
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
taxing the same item in essentially the
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
same manner as a mill
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
rate assessed against assessed
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
value I think further highlights how
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
artificial the distinction is so I think
 
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
that uh without getting further into
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
that discussion
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
now 1563 representative fellow Bill and
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
um I think it's uh 1686 representative
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
luno bill which the house referred for
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
interim study back to
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
education both essentially proposed to
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
flip that equation on its head and start
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
with the idea that there may be a base
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
contribution whatever that is let's just
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
say five
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
Mills and then you build up any
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
remaining state
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
aid per decisions that will be made by
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
the legislature in the
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
future so it's just very interesting to
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
think about what does swept look like
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
and how differently does it look if you
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
flip it around and you make swept the
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
base point and then you figure out from
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
there how do you fill out the Gap um I
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
don't know whether these play in your
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
appeal but I think they're absolutely
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
going to have to play into what this
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
withow 1586 not 1686 thank you
 
00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you um I'm
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
going to talk about the same issue but
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
from a different perspective um I'm
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
wondering why in the Rand case the two
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
sides agreed seem my my interpretation
 
00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
was that the uh two sides agreed that
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
the Statewide property tax was uniformed
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
in rate and equal in valuation am I
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
correct in that assumption the
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much I I that wasn't the let me
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
put that this way that wasn't the
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
central focus of of the um of the
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
dispute in that case the the central
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
Focus was whether allowing for uh
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities to to retain the excess
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
swept amounts that somehow made the tax
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh disproportionate but follow up follow
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
but in in
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
either even in that case the I would
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
think that the Assumption must be that
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
they were anyway so I'm just wondering
 
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
if if um it was recognized that the
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
swept rate is not equal across all the
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
communities um there are reports
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
published every year by both Dr and uh
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education that show
 
00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:53.559 align:start position:0%
the equalized swep rate and it it's
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
considerably different from one town to
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
the the next
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
and um I think that we all understand
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
that there are definitely good reasons
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
to want to know what property
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
values what is the property tax base in
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
different communities but the process of
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
trying to equalize those values to put
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
them all on the same plane is not as
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
precise science at
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
all so one of the differences between
 
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
the money being raised for Education
 
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
through the Statewide property tax from
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
one Community to the next is that a
 
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
characteristic of that is that it's
 
00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.990 align:start position:0%
characteristic of that is that it's
really

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
not an equal tax across all of those
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
communities from my perspective do you
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
do you understand can you can can you
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
enlighten me as to why there was no
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
dispute about that fact in the Rand case
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
I I would have to go back represent the
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
fellows it's it's not something that
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
I've I've thought about recently um and
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
look into that I know you know when
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
we're in litigation one of the things
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
that that happens is you're often
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
responding to you know the particular
 
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
claim that's being brought and so so i'
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look through what the
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs and the Rand case
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
specifically were focused on um my my
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
recollection um and having read the is
 
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
it was really focused on the excess
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
component not a not an argument that
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
because of how um the equalization
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
process works at a local level that it
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
somehow made
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
apologize but but my assumption would be
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
that that wasn't part of the ruling
 
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
because the two sides agreed that it
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
was that equalized and uniformed no so I
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
I would I would only equ with with the
 
00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
word agreed um just in terms of how the
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
litigation process plays out I mean it's
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
really a a game of to some extent I
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say a game but of call and
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
response and so the plain if would would
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
make a particular argument and you
 
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
respond to the arguments that argument
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
that's being made and so I don't recall
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
that specific argument being raised in a
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
way that that it was really addressed in
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
any of the filings but I'd have to go
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
check any more questions for Mr Garland
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
um the conval and the Rand
 
00:46:40.549 --> 00:46:40.559 align:start position:0%
case are going at this from different
 
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
aspects and on from your point of view
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that it really matters but
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
if the Rand case is
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
decided on before the convo case
 
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559 align:start position:0%
on unless we get our representative
 
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
Emmer's Amendment all of a sudden
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
through um we will have a small number
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
of donor towns that are going to be
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
screaming about it uh this is a
 
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
political fact for the legislature and
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
it was a political fact in in on 19 1999
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
and 2001 when we reduced the
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
$666 60 cents on
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
swept to
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
three whatever we reduced it to at that
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
point it was somewhere around 350 I
 
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.549 align:start position:0%
point it was somewhere around 350 I
think

00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
uh but if for instance representative
 
00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
emer's on Amendment went through by that
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
time you would have probably about I
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't know 8 10 times as many towns
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
screaming very
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
loudly because their Pro their swept
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
tax would all of a sudden be close to or
 
00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:16.589 align:start position:0%
tax would all of a sudden be close to or
above

00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
above
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
00:48:23.549 --> 00:48:23.559 align:start position:0%
what they are currently paying I
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
think and
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh that would include my town and would
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
explain to me why my uh city manager
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
joined that Coalition when he didn't
 
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.030 align:start position:0%
joined that Coalition when he didn't
have

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:48:41.069 --> 00:48:41.079 align:start position:0%
to but on these these make for this
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
makes for a really difficult political
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
environment that small number of towns
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
managed to get us to reduce the
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax essential
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
eventually to
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
363 million that would never change with
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
inflation um
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
and uh a larger group of towns
 
00:49:06.359 --> 00:49:07.870 align:start position:0%
and uh a larger group of towns
that

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
on that I'm envisaging would probably
 
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
make it impossible to pass anything in
 
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.670 align:start position:0%
make it impossible to pass anything in
the

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
legislature but um I'm so I'm really I'm
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
wondering about the process of decision
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
where they're going to make them and I'm
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
also on I would like to see that
 
00:49:35.559 --> 00:49:37.870 align:start position:0%
also on I would like to see that
local

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh uh contribution ideas fleshed out
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
enough before the court that they could
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
decide whether they thought that that
 
00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.430 align:start position:0%
decide whether they thought that that
was

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable it's a different way to do it
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
that makes it easier on most of the
 
00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
towns I
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
think understood but I don't
 
00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
know and it it is one of the
 
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.510 align:start position:0%
know and it it is one of the
[Music]

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure challenge is the right
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
word but it it it certainly isn't lost
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
on me um that the litigation and the
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
legal questions that arise in litigation
 
00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:22.599 align:start position:0%
uh affect or influence or or inform or
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
have some bearing on kind of the larger
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
policy questions
 
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
and I did I grew up in the donor town as
 
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
well I can remember going when my U my
 
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
father was on the select board as a kid
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
in Bartlett um going and hearing folks
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
vocally speak on both sides of that
 
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
issue about whether it was a it was a
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
good policy or not and um and it
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
certainly isn't laws of me that those
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
policy considerations which can be
 
00:50:46.349 --> 00:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
contentious uh kind of permeate what
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're doing litigation um our our
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
litigation is is focused on um the
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
Constitutional questions the legal
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
questions and in that way can sometimes
 
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
feel I think uh sterile when you read it
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
that like it it doesn't take into
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
consideration you know the the the
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
bigger policy implications of whatever
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
the court may decide to do whether it's
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
uphold the trial Court's decision strike
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
it down or go a different direction
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
entirely um but but I think that is just
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
part of the reality of the litigation so
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
we're certainly as as I said in response
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
to representative ases we're we're we're
 
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
looking at all of kind of U those
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions as as we're assessing a notice
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
of appeal
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
um how they play in is really going to
 
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
be a legal question in terms of you know
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
the the Constitutional interpretation as
 
00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
it currently stands and and and where uh
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
that it sounds to me like it would be
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
very likely that um we will not be
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
year and so we probably should be
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
putting forward um
 
00:51:58.789 --> 00:51:58.799 align:start position:0%
propositions for next year rather than
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
trying to develop something without
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
knowing where the Court's
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
going this
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
year so as it currently stands in the
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
litigation um the the trial court has
 
00:52:13.789 --> 00:52:13.799 align:start position:0%
directed payments be made in conval uh
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
while the appeal is pending so that the
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
motion to stay that is at the Supreme
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
Court it's ultimately up to the Supreme
 
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
Court to the side and and the
 
00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
implications of a decision one way or
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
the other on that something that I think
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
all uh you know our office and the
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
executive branches would have to
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
consider and and you folks would have to
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
consider as well um the the Rand case
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
and is is slightly different because I
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
embodied in the Court's decision in
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
there I think is is an understanding
 
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
that it will take some time through the
 
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
budget process to kind of even if even
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
if this decision is in place for the the
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
money to actually be um collected and
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
and remitted to to Dr and then what
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
happens to that money is I think a
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
question that would would be subject to
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
further legislation but but it's not
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
something that I guess I I don't want to
 
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
speak for for your I can't speak for
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
your body on what the right choice would
 
00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:03.799 align:start position:0%
be in light of the litigation I don't
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
think it's as clearcut that because the
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
litigation is is is happening right now
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
there there is nothing that um that the
 
00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
political branches may be required to do
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
or or should consider doing while while
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
the litigation is pending I think there
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
in my mind they're separate
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um anybody else any
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you very much but I
 
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you'd stick around a
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
little bit longer just in case um
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
something else comes up but absolutely
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
helpful uh one of the things I want to
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
do I know we've got the work session
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
open on hb514 but um while the
 
00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:51.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is here as well
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
hb1 1655 there was a question yes
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday on um the first part of
 
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:06.309 align:start position:0%
yesterday on um the first part of
that

00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
um the the part of the processing um in
 
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
bold here in section one add for the
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
processing of criminal history and
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
record checks did you have something on
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Aly and I think I
 
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.789 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Aly and I think I
tracked

00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
tracked
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
down the 6 12 section that is involved
 
00:54:28.839 --> 00:54:29.789 align:start position:0%
down the 6 12 section that is involved
in

00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:29.799 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
this and it is it is dedicated fund
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
23 but it's um referred in in the
 
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund manuals to the wrong
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
RSA which is about water
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh and it's RS
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
a21n 9 which is 9 Roman 2 which is Ru
 
00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.390 align:start position:0%
a21n 9 which is 9 Roman 2 which is Ru
making

00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
S4 is the only place in which education
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
has been granted the ability to um to
 
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.829 align:start position:0%
has been granted the ability to um to
put

00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
fees into the certific this
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
certification fund which does
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
exist and would that cover criminal
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
history it is 213 and it doesn't cover
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
criminal does not yet um but can that be
 
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
can that be done through rule making it
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
done through Ru making I am
 
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.710 align:start position:0%
done through Ru making I am
not

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
sure whether this is sufficient
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
RSA to justify it's just uh generic on
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
the board of education has to develop
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
standards in order to among many others
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
things on on set fees for certification
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:06.349 align:start position:0%
kinds of
activities

00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's if that is sufficient
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
authorization or whether you needed
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
something also in the
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
standards but I also don't know because
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
education has divided into something
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
like 40 different sections which they do
 
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
not allow you to search as a body you
 
00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:34.839 align:start position:0%
have to search each one to see if they
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
had anything to do with what you're
 
00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:38.109 align:start position:0%
had anything to do with what you're
talking

00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
about so there may be something in
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
standard somewhere else in
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.029 align:start position:0%
 
know

00:56:56.029 --> 00:56:56.039 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
morning chair and Representative Steve
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
applebe Department of Education um the
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
the collection of fees for criminal stre
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
record checks is also mandated in
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
189 um there's a several sections in in
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
that statute as well that speak to this
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
this was um statutory language passed um
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
by the legislature several years ago
 
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
that tasked the Bureau of credentialing
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
with conducting criminal history record
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
checks as part of the credentialing
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
process and and uh the ability to
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
collect a fee for that process so do you
 
00:57:32.029 --> 00:57:32.039 align:start position:0%
do you believe that
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
um Part B here uh section one I don't
 
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
know if you've had a chance to look at
 
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.230 align:start position:0%
know if you've had a chance to look at
HB

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
1655 yeah um the the bold face there
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
were it says and for the processing of
 
00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:44.039 align:start position:0%
criminal history and record
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
checks uh based on what you just said do
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
you believe that
 
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
already is handled through RSA 189 if I
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
was understanding you
 
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
correctly yeah well I believe The
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
Authority is granted okay uh elsewhere
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
and this this 1655 is more of a
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill the we brought this
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
forward because um the Bureau of
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
credentialing collects fees for for
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
educator licenses and authorizations and
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
crimin hisry record checks and um it is
 
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
a non-aps account of other funds however
 
00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.039 align:start position:0%
it is not continuously
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated and we were told by Das
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
that we needed that language in there so
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
that those funds would pull forward each
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
year automatically which would then save
 
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
the bureau as well as the department and
 
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
ass time in processing requests for
 
00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:39.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation I see um yeah
 
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative PL simple question you
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
brought this forward then this is
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
something you want this is the
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
yes okay representative
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
Ames okay that it seems to me clear that
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
we that the first change in this bill
 
00:59:00.029 --> 00:59:00.039 align:start position:0%
which we've just talked about processing
 
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:03.039 align:start position:0%
of criminal history record checks is is
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
something that you think you need and
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
who we I see no no reason not to go
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
along with that understanding um what
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
about the second part is that uh is
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
that something that you definitely
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
need well yes so so part two just um ad
 
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
that language by um you'll note on line
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
line 13 those words continuously
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated those were the words we
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
were trying to get into the statute I
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
see so that um administrative Services
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
would treat the account a certain way
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's helpful and I'm sure my colleague
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
will have a question on that thank you
 
00:59:47.549 --> 00:59:47.559 align:start position:0%
uh let me just jump to representative
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
fellows because I know yesterday she
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
said that she had talked to if I have
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
these notes correctly the state
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
treasurer and said um it was better not
 
00:59:59.069 --> 00:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
to create a new fund as in this section
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
two so if you want to speak to that yes
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I I talked to the
 
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
state treasurer and also to I Dena I
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
think her last name is call she works in
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
administrative services and she keeps
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
tracks of of the dedicated funds and um
 
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
there already is a fund for
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
certification and one of the things she
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
told me is that all agencies
 
01:00:28.109 --> 01:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
have have to have a review of their
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds every 5 years and the
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is coming up for
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
their review this summer and these and
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
Technical um issues of which what you
 
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned is one of them but there are
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
other technical issues in that in two
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
places in the dedicated fund list that
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
this particular fund has different names
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
and when I look at the sheet this is a
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
the annual report sheet for the um which
 
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
is called here teacher certification and
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's something else on the other page um
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
that the reference to the
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
RSA is is not the correct reference and
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
it has partly to do with the fact that
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
the department was reorganized and not
 
01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:20.039 align:start position:0%
everything got moved back to the right
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
place and that both of these issues are
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
things that can be addressed during that
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
fiveyear review this summer what happens
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
is um people you know all multiple
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
agencies have their funds reviewed and
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
then any
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
um uh amendments or that are required
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
can be part of that big Bill that comes
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
to the uh this committee and so it can
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
be dealt with all at once and and you
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
may have other funds that that need
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
Clarity and that review process is going
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
to look at them closely and see what's
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
necessary so my thought has been that we
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
keep the top part of um this bill the
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
um where it just puts puts the um
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
process for criminal history records
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
checks and amends that but um not do
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
anything related to the dedicated funds
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
at this point and let it go through that
 
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
process of review does that sound like a
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
you I I'm I'm F I guess either way that
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
as I said the purpose was trying to
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
create efficiency on our end and and
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
line it up with how the higher education
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
fee fund runs uh which is not which is
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
continuously appropriated so um that I
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
was not aware that they have a review
 
01:02:48.119 --> 01:02:50.069 align:start position:0%
was not aware that they have a review
process

01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
so represent Aly thank you I started
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
that review
 
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
process and I'm still on the committee
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
and I do all the detail work on the
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.230 align:start position:0%
committee but
on

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
WE this
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
this I don't you
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
you are directing the dedicated fund to
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
find out what it's about to RSA 21 which
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
is the a CH separate chapter
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
in in general
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
government just about some educ chapter
 
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
is just about
 
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
education but then you have another book
 
01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.390 align:start position:0%
education but then you have another book
about

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
education which is um in on in the 186
 
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.309 align:start position:0%
education which is um in on in the 186
area

01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
and first and going
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
to any RSA
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
21 is that is Ru making for the
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
department but there's also rle making
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
for the Department in in the chapter for
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
education and the chapter for Education
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
as I said is divided into something like
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
40 different sub subsections which are
 
01:04:18.839 --> 01:04:19.750 align:start position:0%
40 different sub subsections which are
not

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
connected and I am really worried that
 
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:26.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to spend all year
 
01:04:26.039 --> 01:04:27.390 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to spend all year
working

01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
on on
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
your on dedicated funds which there only
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
seem to be about six of them but there
 
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
more

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
uh that are hidden in in the ru laws
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
that you've
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
Rewritten and I hope you can take back
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
to the department that we've had to do
 
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
this with two other departments
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
that were less complicated than yours
 
01:05:00.269 --> 01:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
and they took a lot of time so so
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
represent giving you a warning about
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
that whatever we decide to do here okay
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
do you have a just um a thought on that
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
at this point my other thought on this
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
is that I don't see
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
that Ru
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
making is the same
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
as legitimizing a fee
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that's essentially what education
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
has got at this point do they have to
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
have have something written in the
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
education law where the certification
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
stuff is uh that says on that
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
establishes that there will be fees
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
which are delineated in this manner I I
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
believe that statutory already language
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
exists that that the state board is
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
charged with setting standards and
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
collecting fees or it's the commissioner
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's one of
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
them yeah I did not see that they were
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
charged with it I just saw that they uh
 
01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
should write rules for
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
it yeah it's buried somewhere check
 
01:06:12.279 --> 01:06:13.349 align:start position:0%
it yeah it's buried somewhere check
about

01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
that does um okay U represent fellows um
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
yes I just wanted to um ask you if is it
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
not true that the Department of
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
Education knows that it it would be um a
 
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
great thing to do to do some
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
reorganizations of your statutes I
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
believe you've asked for money for that
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
before that is not my division um but I
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
do understand that we have asked on
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
several occasions For assistance with
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
that um does anyone have any more
 
01:06:51.309 --> 01:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
specific questions for Mr applebe on uh
 
01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
the 1655 that we were talking about I
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
know that you
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
know we wanted to get clarification on
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr applebe if you'd
 
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
stick around a little longer as well
 
01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:15.390 align:start position:0%
stick around a little longer as well
appreciate

01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
it um does the sponsor want to talk
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
all

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair Daniel
 
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.309 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair Daniel
popovic

01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
Miller I just wanted to make a very
 
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
quick statement that uh we were talking
 
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
a bit earlier about the need to maybe
 
01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
adjust the legislation a little in the
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
fact that one of the funds we were
 
01:07:47.549 --> 01:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
trying to create may already exist and I
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to support any
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
of those changes that are needed as long
 
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
as they meet the needs of the department
 
01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
and I just want to keep it short because
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
I know you have a long day ahead of you
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you represent El if I
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
could just clarify that fund is the one
 
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.789 align:start position:0%
could just clarify that fund is the one
that

01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
is on amended in
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
B1 I believe so yes yes so um you're
 
01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
putting it in the right place the
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
trouble is just that there's no linkage
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
going between whatever they think the
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
law La is that they're using for the
 
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
fees and this fully understood and again
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
any clarification that needs to be made
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
in the text I'll be happy to support
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
again if the does can do their job
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's really the intent it's a minor
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation shouldn't take a
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
lot of time thank you great thank
 
01:08:46.349 --> 01:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
you all right now oh did you have a
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
question oh I just I just wanted to say
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
if if we want an amendment that keeps
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
the the uh top part of that bill in in
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
deletes the part related to establishing
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
a new fund I'm willing to do
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
that okay um this afternoon yeah well
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
it' be good to have it by this afternoon
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
we could act on it representa
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
Olie in listening to the discussion the
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
the question is is that first
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
part needed now which was the question
 
01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I think was
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is it needed now or is
 
01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:21.799 align:start position:0%
it or could or it could obviously could
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
later when you say held until later what
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
do you mean by that a future Bill
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
handles that well like interim study so
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
we have this available so we could uh in
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
u the fall after this um summer study in
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
review of the funds we a collective
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
suggested uh form of legislation could
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
come out of this
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative El me thank you
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
I think the only
 
01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that we
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
need is to get rid of new subar
 
01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.669 align:start position:0%
need is to get rid of new subar
paragraph

01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
2 on because sub paragraph on on State
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
Board of Education section one that is
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
in on oh no no the uh section two of uh
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
from 10 from 11 line 11 to line uh
 
01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.709 align:start position:0%
from 10 from 11 line 11 to line uh
19

01:10:37.709 --> 01:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
on can come out at this
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
point because the fund
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
B1 is being amended to say that it also
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
does processing of criminal record
 
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
checks um
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
B1 I think says no no portion of the
 
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
funds from these fees shall elapse nor
 
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
be used for any other purpose uh nor be
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
transferred well this is old language
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we're pretty much I mean
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know we'll get to this specifically
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
we open the work session on this but
 
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
specifically I think we're fairly in
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
agreement that number two should go um
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
the question is on paragraph
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
one yeah as represent ery just said he
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
believes paragraph one is not needed
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
either therefore making the whole bill
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh maybe suitable for interim study so
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
the question more is on one do we need
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
that language they want to have
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
processing of criminal history
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
background checks uh record checks
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
on B1 is very old language which is not
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
surprising on
 
01:11:57.149 --> 01:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:11:57.159 --> 01:12:01.550 align:start position:0%
we could
replace

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
um the the last sentence of
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
B1 in its entirety um that uh with the
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
the fund shall be non-lps and
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated to the state
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
department of board of education for the
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
purposes established in this chapter um
 
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
and all fees described in sub paragraph
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
one shall be collected by the board uh
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
that's modern language that makes more
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
sense to people these
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
days okay so I think that that's that's
 
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
what we'd need to do represent
 
01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
fellows something to add yeah so are ask
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
I'm asking um representative all are are
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
you saying um take out the second half
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
of line six in that whole sentence no oh
 
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
no I was saying leave leave we need to
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
leave that in because that's what they
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
wanted most okay does that need other
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
than the amendment that's the new um
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
words on line six any changes beyond
 
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
that yes what I was suggesting was to
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
take out at the end of line 8 to to line
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
10 which is very old language oh okay uh
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
and replace it with what's in the bolded
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
language on starting on page on line 12
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
the fund shall be non-lps and
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated and all funds
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
collected by the board relative to
 
01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
certifications be deposited in in to the
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
so that makes sense to me I was just
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
making sure we didn't get get rid of the
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
part that says it has to be reasonable
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
related to the cost of actual activities
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's measurable actually you can you
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
can leave that in and you can leave in I
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
think if you want to you can leave in
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
funds collected from these fees she'll
 
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
purposes but the last part of it is a
 
01:14:16.629 --> 01:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
very old way of saying non-lps and
 
01:14:16.639 --> 01:14:18.510 align:start position:0%
very old way of saying non-lps and
continually

01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
continually
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
appropriated and and non-lps continually
 
01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
appropriated um means a bit more than
 
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
did so um did we did we need a fiscal
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
note on this bill because there is
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
none or is
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
it well they're already doing the
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
processing and they're getting paid for
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
right so representative
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
duet maybe I misunder stood but I didn't
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
hear that it was continually
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated no well that that would be
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
in if we adopted the language that's in
 
01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
the Bolding no no totally understood and
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
that's why the question arises as to
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
whether we should have a fiscal Noe
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
this well I think it probably is
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated at this point
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
didn't oh oh no that's that's the
 
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
question are these
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
fees uh do you have any Appropriations
 
01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
in there other than fees no this is an
 
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
other account other it's fee fee funded
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
account there are no General funds or
 
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
federal funds as part of this account
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
and the issue is they don't they're
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
non-aps however that appropriation is
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
not pulled forward automatically every
 
01:15:50.189 --> 01:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
year and so if something isn't pulled
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
forward for a particular account and so
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
for example let's say um our it Hardware
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation isn't pulled forward and
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
and someone's laptop breaks and we need
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
to purchase a new
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
laptop the process to have that money
 
01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:07.719 align:start position:0%
appropriated even though it's there
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
because it hasn't lapsed is cumbersome
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
consuming okay so and just to to clear
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
up if I could we are currently um by
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
Statute conducting history record checks
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
and collecting fees and um we have
 
01:16:27.239 --> 01:16:28.390 align:start position:0%
and collecting fees and um we have
administrative

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
rules uh in force for that for that
 
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
process so thank you yes that does
 
01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.709 align:start position:0%
process so thank you yes that does
clarify

01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:39.750 align:start position:0%
clarify
that

01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.629 --> 01:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I think Sally uh
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellows you're going to
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
draw up an
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
amendment correct and I'll make sure
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative Al me checks it
 
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative duet did you have a
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
concern about continually appropriated
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
or is that no no I think it was just
 
01:17:08.639 --> 01:17:10.030 align:start position:0%
or is that no no I think it was just
explaining

01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
explaining
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right yes so why don't you you
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
two coordinate and if we can have that
 
01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
for this afternoon if possible that
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
now act on
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
this today no we don't have to exec it
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
today all right we'll see I mean if by
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
chance during lunch it can be submitted
 
01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
and when we get it back great if not
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
later yeah that's why I said if possible
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
yes okay um all right so we're back to

01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
represent Ames well I I think we're good
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
for now I think uh we definitely need to
 
01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.390 align:start position:0%
for now I think uh we definitely need to
have

01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
another meeting on our swept the swept
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
issues swept bills MH um presumably next
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
week I think we've got time to do that
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
and maybe something will happen in the
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
courts in the meantime you know we're
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
going to run out of for that possibility
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
pretty soon but
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah right okay um so then let me
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
close if there's nothing else we'll
 
01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
close HB 1514 and um we'll most likely
 
01:19:07.229 --> 01:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
take this up uh probably on Monday the
 
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
11th uh in a work session and um point
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
of order yes you're kind of doing it but
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
it does seem like as we go through this
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
list we should have kind of a clear
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
statement where it's going next if it's
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
delayed you know we're not going to uh
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
um do it this afternoon you know just so
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
it's really clear where we ended for
 
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
each of these right that's okay yeah
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh 1514 we will not exec uh
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and um Mr chairman it is
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
a it is a bill that needs to be done by
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
March 21st so there's there's six bills
 
01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
left uh no six four five yes there we
 
01:19:49.629 --> 01:19:49.639 align:start position:0%
have six bills um on this sheet that
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
need to be done by March 21st the other
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
bills don't need to be out until uh
 
01:19:59.629 --> 01:19:59.639 align:start position:0%
April 4th and um so keeping that in mind
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
but we still have we still have time uh
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
my expectation is I will set a work
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
session for actually and I need to get
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
that in today um before one o'clock a
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
list of uh what we're doing U on next
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
week and we I'm planning right now not
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
to have well Tuesday is election day
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
there won't be any scheduled committee
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
meetings and the 13th it looks like um
 
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
criminal justice has this room on the
 
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
13th so um I'm probably only scheduling
 
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
the 11th for next week and then the
 
01:20:36.189 --> 01:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
following week you know leave open right
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
now make sure you reserve the 18th and
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
the 19th um and will the 11th have any
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
execs the 11th will have execs I know
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
I'm away on the 11th so I'll notify
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative Aly ahead of time
 
01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
okay I yeah I'm planning on anything
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
that we have a work session on on the
 
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
11th we'll also list as an exec session
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
in case we're able to move forward and
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
exec it representative spillsbury thank
 
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I'm just going to
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
suggest since you're putting 1514 on for
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
next Monday that 1517 and 1563 also be
 
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
deferred to then we have 15 bills this
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
morning we're trying to exec this
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon unless there's specific
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
questions of our guests that we want to
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
ask while they're here and then when we
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
have that discussion let's have a block
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
of time because I think it gets thorny
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
and going to want to take account of
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
three other bills that aren't
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
immediately before us just so that the
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
discussion Embraces six bills on the
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
subject of swept I'm I'm actually going
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
to open each one uh separately and but
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
we may conclude the same thing fairly
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
quickly so I'm going to close the work
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
session on
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
hb514 yes did you have I just wanted to
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
say that um there's a representative
 
01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
here from the Department of Education
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
who can uh talk explain swep and how it
 
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
fits into the Ade c a formula so I don't
 
01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
know if you want to do that today or you
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
want to is that move that to is Monday
 
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
the 11th probably move it to Monday the
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
11th okay so because I anticipate all
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
these um were all these fall under the
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
same category yeah um I just want to see
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
if people have specific questions on
 
01:22:14.669 --> 01:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
each one as I open them and close them
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
so uh 1514 is closed open
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
1563 um we've kind of been talking about
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
all these at once does anyone have
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
anything specific on that
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
1563 yes so do you want me to just go
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
through the amendment and how it's
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
different from the original or hold on
 
01:22:33.719 --> 01:22:35.430 align:start position:0%
different from the original or hold on
that

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.629 align:start position:0%
that
also

01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
um given the given the time we probably
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
should hold it okay to next week okay so
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
I'll close 1563 and that will also you
 
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
know be on schedule for Monday the 11th
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
um and and I'll schedule these first so
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice hopefully and
 
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
and Department of Education can come uh
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
first thing I don't know yet whether
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to be 9:30 or actually
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
probably should start at 9:30 so that we
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
can get get through as much as possible
 
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
um on Monday so we'll all these
 
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
education bills those those three uh
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
1655 I think we're pretty much set with
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
but so I'll close 156 three
 
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
um 1517 U I'll open
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
is yeah th this one deals with um excess
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
money from games of chance but
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
interestingly yesterday I think we we
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
concluded that that
 
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
bill certainly this is just my opinion
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
now that Bill may not be necessary
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
because the highest uh um I'm getting to
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
my note 5.38 million was the most that
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
lotteries collected we haven't even
 
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
gotten close to the 6.6 million so that
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh may be uh moved so this one I do
 
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
want to get comments on representative
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I I I think this bill is ready
 
01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:18.280 align:start position:0%
to be EXA exact and uh yeah the I think
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
the uh what I would be voting for is I
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
um we'll do the exact well we have to do
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
the exact uh this afternoon M Mr
 
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I i' just like to say I
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
completely concur it doesn't have to
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
ride with the other SWAT bills it can be
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
dealt with now and it'll be mooded right
 
01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
okay good um I'm seeing a lot of
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
agreement there so I will close the work
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
1517

01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
1517
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
um I think are there are there any other
 
01:25:00.189 --> 01:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
bills so uh that doj or education needs
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
to be here for I don't want them to have
 
01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
see we talked about
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
15 1655 does anyone think that we need
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education or doj office
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
doj's office here for any of the other
 
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.590 align:start position:0%
doj's office here for any of the other
bills

01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:37.790 align:start position:0%
 
with

01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%

01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I'll open the uh work session on HB
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
1193 relative to the establishment of a
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
child care tax credit program and
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
pl we heard a lot of testimony on a
 
01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
different Bill yesterday 1611 relative
 
01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
to child care Workforce fund and in
 
01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
hearing that I heard about the dire need
 
01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
for for uh education for support for
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
child care uh this this 1193 attacks it
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
in a different fashion instead of uh a a
 
01:26:59.310 --> 01:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
work force fund to help uh the Educators
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
the providers this is a $100,000 credit
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
towards employers who are not child care
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
providers to help provide a benefit to
 
01:27:09.629 --> 01:27:09.639 align:start position:0%
their employees and I think it may be
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
consider well it's 100,000 credit up to
 
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
10 million uh in
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
total um representative Aly
 
01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think it's going to go very
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
far if it's just 10 million and if it's
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
more than 10 million we're in possible
 
01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.470 align:start position:0%
more than 10 million we're in possible
fiscal

01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:38.070 align:start position:0%
fiscal
trouble

01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.709 align:start position:0%
trouble
um

01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
it's uh the reason that they put
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
together that other bill is that it is
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
trying to get at the
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
workforce if they can figure figure out
 
01:27:56.109 --> 01:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
how to get the workforce adequately
 
01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
compensated there will be more Workforce
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
and the employers won't have a problem
 
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
and it will cost less to do it that way
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's what they were
 
01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.310 align:start position:0%
that's what they were
thinking

01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
on and I'm all for I mean this the child
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
care area is so
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
vast that
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
um it's going to to take as many
 
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
economies of this as we can
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
get but this would
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
just on at one end of the spectrum it
 
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
would only help 10 employers who were
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
each asking
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
for for
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
money I think that's what it ends up
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
being well if it would actually be 100
 
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
employers if it was only one per
 
01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
employers there's only one per they'd
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
mostly be the bigger
 
01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
employers uh well they'd all be the
 
01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.750 align:start position:0%
employers uh well they'd all be the
bigger

01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
bigger
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
employers and that would leave out
 
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.030 align:start position:0%
employers and that would leave out
everybody

01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
else

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
frankly well we haven't heard from the
 
01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.950 align:start position:0%
frankly well we haven't heard from the
employers

01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.109 --> 01:29:21.119 align:start position:0%
Sweeney you'd think they would have come
 
01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
in if
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
if they thought that this was going to
 
01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.390 align:start position:0%
if they thought that this was going to
be

01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
useful with
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
have right uh
 
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
representa I don't recall uh The
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
Business Association showing up for uh
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
this particular piece of
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
legislation but at the same same time
 
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that was on
 
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
um I do know that businesses compete
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
with each other and use the provision of
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
child care as incentives for
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
hiring staff
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's that needs to be taken
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
into the equation as well right if I
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
could on one of the top priorities of
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
the Bia is child care after housing and
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
um I would be very surprised if they
 
01:30:34.030 --> 01:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been following the bills that
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
are labeled Child
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
Care representative Southworth I
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
actually saw your micophone oh great I I
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
think of the tax credit programs we've
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
done in some ways as enabling and you
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
really don't know who wants to take
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
advantage of it but I think the idea is
 
01:30:55.229 --> 01:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
good and I think I'm not sure there
 
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
would be harm in just seeing what
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
businesses do with it I don't think it
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
would anything sudden would happen um
 
01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
because like anything there are
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
different strings um but I think it's
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to consider again that we're
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
kind of giving it to businesses enabling
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
because they have other options for tax
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
credits too and for some this may be the
 
01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
right one thank you represent
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I I think it's a good idea um
 
01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.030 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I I think it's a good idea um
but

01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
I I also know that the Dr suggested a
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
amendments um if you look on the F
 
01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.270 align:start position:0%
amendments um if you look on the F
fiscal

01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
note yeah it is a fiscal yeah the fiscal
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
note quick guide is what I have here um
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
the last five paragraphs essentially are
 
01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.430 align:start position:0%
the last five paragraphs essentially are
five

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
different suggestions or amendments some
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
of which are definitely
 
01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.750 align:start position:0%
of which are definitely
necessary

01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
so you know it's processing issue I
 
01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
guess I I think it's a good good bill if
 
01:31:59.950 --> 01:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
everybody else does then we've got to
 
01:32:03.109 --> 01:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
fix it um I don't think we can do that
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
before this
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon no that's definitely too many
 
01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.790 align:start position:0%
afternoon no that's definitely too many
changes

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
there let me um represent let me just
 
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
get some other representative elberger
 
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would rather see
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
this money spent in potentially two
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
other ways one is direct credits to uh
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
parents of children to help pay for
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
their child care or credits to employees
 
01:32:38.669 --> 01:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
who set up child care facilities within
 
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
their and this would certainly only work
 
01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
for larger employers but who set up
 
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
child care uh programs within their
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
facilities which would be a whole lot
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
more convenient for parents s quite
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
honestly because they go to work they
 
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
drop their children off at this end of
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
the building and they just walk down the
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
building to where they're working I I'm
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
not as fond as this of this model as I
 
01:33:05.229 --> 01:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
am of either of the other
 
01:33:07.629 --> 01:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
two represent
 
01:33:07.639 --> 01:33:09.390 align:start position:0%
two represent
Aly

01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
Aly
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
yeah he tacked on microphone please he
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
tacked on a totally different uh tax
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
credit which has no financing on a
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
on on the page
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
two and he didn't really talk about
 
01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
out page page two what lines you talking
 
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
about on lines one to uh s to eight no I
 
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
think it's five oh 52 five
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
5 um no right no it's one to
 
01:33:54.239 --> 01:33:56.669 align:start position:0%
5 um no right no it's one to
prev

01:33:56.669 --> 01:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
prev
 
01:33:59.790 --> 01:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
okay oh yeah it starts at the end of the
 
01:34:02.109 --> 01:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
previous page the granite state Paid
 
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
Family Leave plan tax credit
 
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
M there is no idea of how much money it
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah but he seems to have done this
 
01:34:25.109 --> 01:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
committee representative fellows um yeah
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of you know maybe the
 
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
general concept is fine but there are a
 
01:34:37.709 --> 01:34:37.719 align:start position:0%
couple like details I I don't like to
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
see things that say if there's not
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
enough money we're going to prate it and
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
when you start because I see that that's
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
a mechanism that department of education
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
has used for different kinds of funding
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
to schools but that's that it works okay
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
in that situation but when we're talking
 
01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
about a credit the the company's going
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
to give out this money or cover this
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
expense and then claim it as a tax
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
credit and then after everybody
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
submitted their tax you know forms then
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to find out you they asked
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
for more than a
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
hundred that more than $10 million and
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
and then their tax credit isn't worth
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
what they thought it was and I just
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
think that's I don't like to see that
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
kind of mechanism and the my other
 
01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:35.239 align:start position:0%
concern is that for at least most of
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
most of this they have to qualify for
 
01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
that existing Child Care scholarship
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
program who's going to monitor that is
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
somebody going to go and check and make
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
sure that there it's only going to
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
people who are qualified so who's going
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
to do that that's an administrative kind
 
01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:54.870 align:start position:0%
to do that that's an administrative kind
of

01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
task represent spillsbury
 
01:35:59.229 --> 01:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm not prepared to support
 
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
this bill for a whole bunch of reasons
 
01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
and I was about to bring up the $10
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
million limitation the pro rating the
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
employer has absolutely no idea what
 
01:36:12.669 --> 01:36:12.679 align:start position:0%
credit he's going to end up with at the
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
end of the day I think the mechanism
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
itself is flawed I have a personal
 
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
predisposition that the tax law should
 
01:36:25.149 --> 01:36:25.159 align:start position:0%
be generally you know neutral uh across
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know the breadth of where it's
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
applied the use of tax credits to me
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
you've got an uphill um challenge to
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
justify and persuade me that a tax
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
credit is a good way of achieving a
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
social policy so while we may have a
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
consensus that child care is an issue uh
 
01:36:47.950 --> 01:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
this vehicle is not necessarily the
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
right way to go it also it means tests
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
the individuals it limits the total
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
amount of the program there's about a
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
half dozen technical uh changes that the
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
Dr was going to
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
suggest and uh it also feels just kind
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
of peac meal I you know we created a
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
special committee I would think the
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
purpose of that special committee is to
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
create a synthesized comprehensive
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
here's the set of solutions that are
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
going to help the state deal with a
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
genuine problem and for example we have
 
01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
uh hb6
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
1611 on the docket today as well which
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
is an entirely different way of of
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with the uh um the child care uh
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh Problem by addressing the employees
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
of the child care facility so uh I I
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
just think that this
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh plus what representative Aly said
 
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
about there seems to be an epidemic of
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
proposals for non-aps funds with no
 
01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
current funding uh designated I think
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
we've got at least three of them on the
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
docket today yeah represent roachford
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman um so I put a
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
lot of work into this over the summer in
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
this concept and in speaking and I I
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to a number of my colleagues
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
here since we had the initial hearing
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
and I really wanted to see what their
 
01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
thought was and and and get the feel for
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
it and I think that you know having gone
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
through this process understanding there
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
is a need recognizing there's you know
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
this is a unique solution I have to
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
agree with everything my colleague uh uh
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
at the end of the aisle at the end of
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
the row here said um there is a special
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
and I think representative Aly said the
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
same thing I mean there is a special
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
committee for child care and perhaps
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
this is where it should landed to begin
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
with uh because that's the policy first
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
and then this is the second this is you
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
know the the ways and means should be
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
working on the funding and and and the
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
money second um so you know my
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
my position has largely changed on this
 
01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
to match uh representative spillsbury
 
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
and I know representative Aly has said
 
01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
said a lot of the same things that I'm
 
01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
thinking representative uh fellows as
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
well so you at this point I I would be
 
01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:08.830 align:start position:0%
well so you at this point I I would be
willing

01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
willing
 
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
to you know put this on the back shelf
 
01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
um for the time being and perhaps maybe
 
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
bring it back next year with something
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
that uh does go through the policy
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
aspect first then comes to
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
us thank you um any brother M
 
01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:28.270 align:start position:0%
us thank you um any brother M
representative

01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:30.669 --> 01:39:30.679 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you U my opinion
 
01:39:33.310 --> 01:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
shifted too hearing all of the things I
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
still like the idea um but I also think
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
it would be fine for it to go to the
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
committee uh and hearing all the list of
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
concerns I just don't think the specific
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
bill that this is the right time for
 
01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
it sounds good um all right represent
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
AES since I spoke on it before I I just
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
would say that I concur in the
 
01:39:57.790 --> 01:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
thoughtful comments by the various
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
people who have spoken just before
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
me okay there's no other comments uh
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
we'll close the uh work session on this
 
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill okay close the work session on
 
01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
bill okay close the work session on
HB

01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
1193 now open the work session on HB
 
01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.830 align:start position:0%
1193 now open the work session on HB
1429

01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
1429
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
plet yes thank you Mr chair um as a
 
01:40:28.750 --> 01:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
result of the last hearing we had on
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
this bill we got a letter from Robert
 
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
Scott the uh chair of Commissioner of
 
01:40:37.589 --> 01:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services he
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
says when it went through the previous
 
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
committee two issues were raised uh one
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
of which uh was that uh the uh it
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
applies to all dams as originally
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
written instead of the ones owned by
 
01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
Dees uh and so uh and the second issue
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
was uh Dam removed to prevent
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
environmental damage it may be helpful
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
the law for case-by casee exception the
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
municipal offer requirement well we I
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
have in front of you
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh number uh 0960
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
H uh and that Amendment uh changes the
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
language so that uh this that it's in
 
01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
this section state owned Dam means any
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
Dam owned exclusively by the department
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
Department of environmental services so
 
01:41:24.589 --> 01:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
it excludes all of the D dams as a
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
result so that took care of one of their
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
concerns the other concern the the in
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph three the it says the
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
procedure in paragraph two shall not
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
apply if upon receipt of information
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
reasonably believed to be valid the
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Environmental Services
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
believe the DM to be an imminent danger
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
of failure and a threat to the lives and
 
01:41:43.199 --> 01:41:44.149 align:start position:0%
of failure and a threat to the lives and
property

01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
Downstream we I did have another in a
 
01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
interim draft that had some additional
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
language in there but uh the discussion
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
with my uh House and Senate colleagues
 
01:41:57.870 --> 01:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
thought it went too far giving the uh
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services too
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
much sway but we do have this language
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
in here about imminent danger so they
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to offer if it's collapse so
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
we think we've taken care of the the
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
concerns of the uh Department of
 
01:42:13.149 --> 01:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and it's ready to
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
go forward before the the policy has
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
already been decided that remind people
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
of that so what we're looking for from
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
this committee is just simply
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
establishing the fund and putting a
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
dollar in it and that way um through the
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
but normal budget process starting next
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
year the dees can request funds to be
 
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
put into that fund and would go to the
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
various Finance committees to act
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
lle thank you Mr chair thanks for taking
 
01:42:49.709 --> 01:42:49.719 align:start position:0%
my question um thank you for the
 
01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it does address a lot
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
of the issues uh one question I have is
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
just to confirm
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
that if the department does is able to
 
01:43:03.870 --> 01:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
get money put into this fund it would be
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
money that would indebt the
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities it wouldn't be State
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
funding for a state responsibility to
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
take care of the the dams it would be
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
money to loan
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities who would who want to
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
take over the dam exactly right it would
 
01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
be State money only to fund uh this line
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
item uh as a a potential loan to
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities which would be paid back
 
01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:28.910 align:start position:0%
municipalities which would be paid back
with

01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
interest as an alternative to bonding um
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
and and uh so it could make money uh in
 
01:43:37.390 --> 01:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
the process of of because it' have to
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
pay back with interest uh and so it
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
would have to have sufficient funds in
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
there at least the the immediate problem
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
is gos down uh with with the but but
 
01:43:49.589 --> 01:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
there's 273 dams throughout the state
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
that they own and and so so it will
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
affect many other municipalities besides
 
01:43:54.159 --> 01:43:56.629 align:start position:0%
affect many other municipalities besides
gwn

01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
gwn
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
eventually and I have a followup to that
 
01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
um so I guess my hope would be that if
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
the dees needs
 
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
funding to take care of the dams that
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
fall under their purview that they are
 
01:44:14.669 --> 01:44:14.679 align:start position:0%
indeed responsible for that they would
 
01:44:14.679 --> 01:44:16.149 align:start position:0%
indeed responsible for that they would
request

01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
funding not to go not only funding to go
 
01:44:23.229 --> 01:44:23.239 align:start position:0%
into this loan program but money from
 
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
the state to live up to the state's
 
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility to take care of the dams
 
01:44:29.790 --> 01:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
that fall under their purview so I hope
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
that that the department would make that
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
request um if if funds are needed thank
 
01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
you absolutely right but the what we're
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
talking about is uh dams that uh no
 
01:44:44.589 --> 01:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
longer have a commercial
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh Hydro power therefore they lose the
 
01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
ability uh to have a license from Fork
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not swearing Federal Energy
 
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission uh uh to maintain
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
that Dam so the dam would eventually
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
have to be shut down unless there's a
 
01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
process in place to put fish ladders in
 
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
uh and that may be beyond the state
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
purview to do but the municipality might
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
want to tackle that right now they have
 
01:45:15.629 --> 01:45:15.639 align:start position:0%
a grant for request for $2 million to
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
the feds to to put fish ladds uh fish
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
passages I shouldn't say ladds this
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
passages around Kelly Falls in
 
01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester and then truck to Greg Falls
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
in in uh North uh excuse me uh west of
 
01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
uh that that Dam so that those dams
 
01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
would be able to have uh commercially
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
viable hydro and keep their Federal
 
01:45:41.589 --> 01:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
licenses the one that's in question
 
01:45:44.189 --> 01:45:44.199 align:start position:0%
right now is Hadley Falls in downtown
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
gson which is probably a goner but we
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
maybe want to replace it with some sort
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
of Coffer Dam that feds wouldn't
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
consider a Dam to keep the economic
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
activity going that's something that the
 
01:45:59.149 --> 01:45:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
Elber thank you um I want to try to
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple of things because at
 
01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:11.239 align:start position:0%
this point based on the assumptions I
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
have I'm not fond of this bill so I want
 
01:46:15.790 --> 01:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
to find out if my assumptions are
 
01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:17.430 align:start position:0%
to find out if my assumptions are
accurate

01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh the um
 
01:46:23.229 --> 01:46:23.239 align:start position:0%
representative PL you talked about
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
they're not commercial they're they're
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
not uh generating hydroelectric power is
 
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
that right um there is a Hydro power
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
facility at Greg Falls there's one
 
01:46:38.189 --> 01:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
currently at Kelly Falls but the but the
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
own the generator at Kelly fall says we
 
01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
can't afford these fish passages so
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to submit to Federal Energy
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission to uh give up our
 
01:46:50.589 --> 01:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
license which would require removal of
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
the dam uh so state is thees is stepping
 
01:46:57.589 --> 01:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
in with a grant request to put the fist
 
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
passages in and with the fist passages
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
they'll be negotiating with somebody to
 
01:47:04.589 --> 01:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
continue prod providing power there but
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not possible for a
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
commercial entity to do that it's just
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
way too
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
expensive my concerns are if if I may
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
follow up my concerns are
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
that with the state as the owner manager
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the dams they are looking beyond the
 
01:47:31.629 --> 01:47:31.639 align:start position:0%
immediate impact of a specific Dam
 
01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
they're looking at what happens
 
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
Downstream from the dam and it's
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
unlikely for that broader thinking
 
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
broader impact thinking to be taking
 
01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
place if each Community is responsible
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
for its Dam or its several dams and I am
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about the fact that well I'm
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
I'm in town a and I I want to deal with
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
my dam this way and I haven't talked to
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
town B which is just Downstream and it's
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
going to have a serious impact but
 
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
that's not my problem if I'm only taking
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
care of my dam I understand first of all
 
01:48:16.109 --> 01:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
that's a policy issue that I think has
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
already been decided but uh I I'm sorry
 
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:20.790 align:start position:0%
already been decided but uh I I'm sorry
I

01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:48:22.750 --> 01:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
I'll let you finish yeah but the policy
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
issue that was taken up in the first
 
01:48:27.790 --> 01:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
committee um in in my particular case
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's Hadley Falls downtown gos down
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
which is pretty small and Upstream from
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
Upstream from that there isn't any to to
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
for quite a distance uh there may be a
 
01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
small one in New Boston but it's it's
 
01:48:42.669 --> 01:48:42.679 align:start position:0%
it's uh uh the I
 
01:48:45.790 --> 01:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
guess our task is to establish a dollar
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
fund that's it I if I may just one one
 
01:48:55.709 --> 01:48:55.719 align:start position:0%
followup I see this as a financial issue
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
because if in my decision making as town
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
a I take action that causes Financial
 
01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
harm to town B which is Downstream
 
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
that's a fiscal impact and I don't think
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
that we can dismiss that potential
 
01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact thank you I think Dees
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
would take that into account involve
 
01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:18.149 align:start position:0%
would take that into account involve
Town

01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
Town
 
01:49:25.229 --> 01:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.239 --> 01:49:27.629 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:49:27.629 --> 01:49:27.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
Al you you said all right thank
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative PL you said this is a not
 
01:49:36.270 --> 01:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
a policy
 
01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
question uh has there been any
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
change on your amendment to what was the
 
01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
original bill in wording or in cuz I
 
01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:49.159 align:start position:0%
can't match up some of the lines here
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
with the original bill
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
well it in section one this section
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
state owned Dam means any Dam own
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
exclusively by the department that
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the original Bill
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
23 that's the that's the essence of it
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
so it's it's instead of all state dams
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's dams owned by the Department of
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services there there is
 
01:50:27.679 --> 01:50:28.669 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services there there is
another

01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
change on page
 
01:50:35.070 --> 01:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
two lines four and
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
five so after saying any municipally
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
owned Dam this now adds or Dam owned by
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
other interested parties who are capable
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
of assessing local property taxes or
 
01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.950 align:start position:0%
of assessing local property taxes or
issuing

01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
issuing
 
01:50:49.229 --> 01:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
debt that came out of the previous
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
committee's work actually uh so the dees
 
01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
was saying if the uh town or Min City
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
may not want to do it but but there may
 
01:51:04.109 --> 01:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
be a a a uh Village District formed uh
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
which which which could do this sort of
 
01:51:08.069 --> 01:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
thing which might be Beyond a town or
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
city uh so so so but that that that that
 
01:51:13.390 --> 01:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
is you're correct that's an additional
 
01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
change but they have to have capab that
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
came from the M Municipal Association
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
they would have to have taxing Authority
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
that represent what would be an interest
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
oh I'm Sor I'm sorry so an interest
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
party would be what a village District
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
what else could it be it has to have
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
taxing authorities so would have to be a
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
village District so let's not say or
 
01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
other interested parties well that that
 
01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
is it it's got they've got to have
 
01:51:46.109 --> 01:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
ability to raise to to impose fees on
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
their if if if it could I suppose be a a
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
a it's a Property Owners Association
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
that has has has the ability to T tax
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
that are there any represent yes that
 
01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
that are allowed to tax their residents
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh not with use not with the word tax no
 
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
I I live I live in a co-op for over 55
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
community and I have $500 a month rent
 
01:52:22.069 --> 01:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
and I have to pay that or I get evicted
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so that it's it don't call it a tax
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
same Home Owners Association same thing
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
but it's not a
 
01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.149 align:start position:0%
but it's not a
tax

01:52:31.149 --> 01:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
so I my question is how we can fit into
 
01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:39.589 align:start position:0%
so I my question is how we can fit into
this

01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
something that either
 
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
says that it only involves
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
dams that
 
01:52:52.589 --> 01:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
that have no significant impact on the
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
waterways below
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
them below below the the town in which
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
it is or that there is
 
01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
mandatorily uh that the towns that would
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
all be
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
affected join together in this
 
01:53:23.550 --> 01:53:23.560 align:start position:0%
in this project below but but you mean
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
below do you mean Upstream Downstream
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
Downstream I don't know how a damn there
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
actually there are sometimes effects
 
01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
Upstream uh when you impound water and
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
then you you open it up all of a sudden
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's they're extreme in Lebanon area um
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
but the on what we're talking about is
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
Downstream if
 
01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
they if the dam collapses or if uh the
 
01:53:59.950 --> 01:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
dam on dams the water to a larger extent
 
01:54:02.069 --> 01:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
so you've got a nicer Lake but down
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
below you've you've got a creek uh where
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
you used to have a
 
01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
river on and you have a dam there that
 
01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:13.510 align:start position:0%
river on and you have a dam there that
can't

01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
operate H with Hydro because it's lost
 
01:54:22.270 --> 01:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
um this this is a situation that we get
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
between the US and Mexico on the border
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
we've stolen most of Mexico's
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
water for the west of Mexico and but it
 
01:54:38.109 --> 01:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
was because they weren't thinking about
 
01:54:40.069 --> 01:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
these things in those
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
days let me just interject here I mean
 
01:54:45.709 --> 01:54:45.719 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of this could get
 
01:54:48.069 --> 01:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
extremely complex so I the question I
 
01:54:50.109 --> 01:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
have right now is how does does it work
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
now if a state if the state decides to
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
remove a dam they remove the dam they
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
remove the dam they are responsible for
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
any liability Downstream they they are
 
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for removing the dam
 
01:55:07.149 --> 01:55:07.159 align:start position:0%
safely uh and uh that's it uh and uh
 
01:55:09.069 --> 01:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
what happens Downstream happens
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
Downstream their responsibility is to
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
remove the dam that could be a potential
 
01:55:17.069 --> 01:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
Hazard um and U this does not
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
contemplate building bigger dams or
 
01:55:21.149 --> 01:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
anything like that with the concern that
 
01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
raised by representative Aly comes into
 
01:55:25.709 --> 01:55:25.719 align:start position:0%
play that's one of the things that I
 
01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
brought up but there are a lot of
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
different things that can go
 
01:55:33.310 --> 01:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
on well the reason for my question
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative PL was I if at the end of
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
the day if the
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
state is I don't know I guess um gives
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
its approval to the to the plan then the
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
state would still be the one liable if
 
01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
something right I think I think the
 
01:55:55.629 --> 01:55:55.639 align:start position:0%
issue is towns towns could could get
 
01:55:58.109 --> 01:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
destroyed by being liable for something
 
01:55:59.790 --> 01:55:59.800 align:start position:0%
going wrong I think that's part of the
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
issue Town's can get destroyed by having
 
01:56:05.069 --> 01:56:05.079 align:start position:0%
the damn fail and the concern with
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
the is that uh dams the Hadley Falls uh
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
is is a hazard right now U uh because
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not put into the Bedrock
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
well enough it was done a long time ago
 
01:56:21.790 --> 01:56:21.800 align:start position:0%
so it will eventually fail so that they
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
do have to remove it and it's it to me
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
it's a gone a done deal uh the question
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
is can we put some sort of Coffer Dam
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
smaller in so we still have the economic
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
ability uh uh to to to economic benefit
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
but without without Federal Energy
 
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
Regulatory condition calling at a dam uh
 
01:56:42.350 --> 01:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure what all the concerns
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
are about bigger dams or anything like
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
that that's not going to happen
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lee please thank you Mr
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
chair um I agree with what you bring up
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this is my main concern is is
 
01:56:58.149 --> 01:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
passing on this kind of liability to a
 
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
city um and I would like to add to that
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
idea my understanding that the state has
 
01:57:06.990 --> 01:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
already entered into this kind of
 
01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
understanding with cities I don't think
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
the state is barred from entering into
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
this kind of agreement with cities so
 
01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we need this piece of leg
 
01:57:23.709 --> 01:57:23.719 align:start position:0%
ation so that the state can enter into
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
such an agreement with a city um so to
 
01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
me it seems like we don't need it to
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
solve the problem that gtown is facing
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
for example um and I think it raises a
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
lot of very big concerns
 
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair representative
 
01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:43.030 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair representative
spillsbury

01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
I concur with that um but Shifting the
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
conversation to the fiscal side what
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
we're doing here is we're creating a
 
01:57:53.790 --> 01:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
hollow construct putting $1 into it and
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
then it just goes onto the Shelf until a
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
future legislature decides to fund it it
 
01:58:01.149 --> 01:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't even activate unless it's got a
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
minimum of 2.5 million I heard estimates
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
during the hearing that it might take 40
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
to 50 million to be a um you know a
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
dynamic program so I uh without opining
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
on the policy issue I think from a
 
01:58:21.629 --> 01:58:21.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal standpoint there's no real point
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
in advancing this bill at this
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
time respond yes without the without the
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
fund uh the uh I guess the purpose of
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
the fund is so that the dees can ask for
 
01:58:39.550 --> 01:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
money uh and go through the budget
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
process next year there's a fund to put
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
it that's all and so you're you're right
 
01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
that the Dollar by itself isn't doing
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
anything but we will enable the de to
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
request funds to be put into it through
 
01:58:54.669 --> 01:58:54.679 align:start position:0%
the normal budget process in future
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
years and the rest of that was all
 
01:58:59.790 --> 01:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
policy issues was brought
 
01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
up be on the finance representative Aly
 
01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:04.709 align:start position:0%
up be on the finance representative Aly
followed

01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
followed
 
01:59:09.870 --> 01:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
by uh ores and then fellows but we know
 
01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
de for at least 20 years now has had
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
insufficient funds to pay for the dams
 
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
that they consider highest
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
priority and so you're going to be
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
asking them to ask for both things at
 
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
maybe representative ORS I'm sorry could
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
I ask you to repeat that I couldn't hear
 
01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
you yeah oh sorry um well I'm thinking
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the Pittsburgh Dam which is at the
 
01:59:51.550 --> 01:59:51.560 align:start position:0%
top of the Connecticut and which is on
 
01:59:54.189 --> 01:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut River and Lebanon is
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
halfway down and um they had to delay
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
for more than 10 years the inspection
 
02:00:07.149 --> 02:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
that they know knew they needed to do
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
and repairs they needed to do so that it
 
02:00:10.159 --> 02:00:11.870 align:start position:0%
and repairs they needed to do so that it
wouldn't

02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
02:00:16.589 --> 02:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
break and this is 20 years
 
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
ago and I was
 
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
informed that I shouldn't worry because
 
02:00:26.669 --> 02:00:26.679 align:start position:0%
it the surge if it broke wouldn't get to
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
Lebanon but there are a number of towns
 
02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
Lebanon but there are a number of towns
in

02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:00:35.390 --> 02:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
between so um they've been in the and we
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
had to work with them early on because
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
the governor didn't want to spend the
 
02:00:42.589 --> 02:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
money on dams and we were trying to
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to get enough money so
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
they could sort of keep up with their
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:49.790 align:start position:0%
they could sort of keep up with their
scheduling

02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
02:00:53.790 --> 02:00:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
on yes so um I absolutely agree with you
 
02:01:01.069 --> 02:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why we're taking what
 
02:01:03.390 --> 02:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
in my mind seems to be a state issue and
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
trying to pass it off to the town for
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
one thing another thing is I discussed
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
this with my wife she's environmental
 
02:01:13.109 --> 02:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
scientist she said there's a lot more
 
02:01:16.109 --> 02:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
going on with the dam especially a dam
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
like Pittsburgh that's been there for
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
many decade she said there's there's
 
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
this buildup behind the dam that if they
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
were to just take it out and Let It Roar
 
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more going to happen then
 
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
people realize it will wipe out the
 
02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
fishing industry and so so forth so why
 
02:01:34.990 --> 02:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
are we going to pass this off to the
 
02:01:38.109 --> 02:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
towns I mean this sounds like something
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
maybe the governor asked for emergency
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
funds from Washington to help work this
 
02:01:47.950 --> 02:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
problem this this is not a town problem
 
02:01:50.350 --> 02:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
this problem is much bigger than
 
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
towns represent fellows um yeah I want
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
to just kind of wrap together some of
 
02:01:58.069 --> 02:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
the things I've heard here so one
 
02:02:02.069 --> 02:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
concern I have is using money for a
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
non-urgent situation when the dees has
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
told us that uh
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
273 state owned dams need 4
 
02:02:18.069 --> 02:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
$414 million in repair and that the
 
02:02:21.550 --> 02:02:21.560 align:start position:0%
category that's High Hazard will cost
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
$300 million to repair how we can think
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
of putting any money into a fund for
 
02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities to use to um fix a dam
 
02:02:35.790 --> 02:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fit into that category
 
02:02:38.069 --> 02:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
that's um really concerning and the
 
02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
other thing is I still don't have any
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
Clarity on what can happen now with the
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
dam because somebody else mentioned this
 
02:02:49.629 --> 02:02:49.639 align:start position:0%
but I remember somebody saying that the
 
02:02:54.510 --> 02:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
dees can sell a dam to a or transfer a
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
dam to a municipality already so if
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's in I just I would like to know is
 
02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:05.629 align:start position:0%
that's in I just I would like to know is
that

02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
correct represent Aly yeah uh that may
 
02:03:13.149 --> 02:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
have been what I said and they have done
 
02:03:16.069 --> 02:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
that in the in the case of Lebanon but
 
02:03:20.189 --> 02:03:20.199 align:start position:0%
it was one of the dams that does not
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
affect other
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities it right
 
02:03:27.709 --> 02:03:27.719 align:start position:0%
across Route 10 it was going to going to
 
02:03:31.229 --> 02:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
wipe out piece of rout 10 if it went but
 
02:03:34.589 --> 02:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
on it was right across Route 10 from the
 
02:03:34.599 --> 02:03:37.470 align:start position:0%
on it was right across Route 10 from the
hydroelectric

02:03:37.470 --> 02:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
Dam it was an old old dam for uh water
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
for the boilers for the
 
02:03:49.549 --> 02:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
trains is there a statute that says that
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
they can do that I'm sorry I didn't ask
 
02:03:53.790 --> 02:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
for I don't know if there's a statute
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
but they offered it to us they said
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
we're either going to take it out which
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
is fairly easy with a small one on or uh
 
02:04:07.390 --> 02:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
you take it over and we'll teach you how
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
to to shore up the
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
dam which is what we
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
did because it was a major Recreation
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
asset for
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
Lebanon all right um yes represent
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
spilsbury I think we're getting to the
 
02:04:24.069 --> 02:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
point very quickly because I don't think
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
we want to debate this now but I it
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
seems to me that I could conceive a bill
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
being drafted that would deal
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
specifically with the GS toown problem
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
and a funding mechanism tied to it and
 
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
that would be an interesting Bill to see
 
02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.149 align:start position:0%
that would be an interesting Bill to see
next

02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
next
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
term thank you I think we've uh I think
 
02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
we pretty well exhausted this for now um
 
02:04:46.109 --> 02:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
unless someone has some very compelling
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
thing to say just sorry
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
so we are going toct that one this
 
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon I feel we probably will yeah
 
02:04:55.709 --> 02:04:55.719 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to always you know
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
have that at the end okay yeah you know
 
02:05:00.669 --> 02:05:00.679 align:start position:0%
what I mean yeah I mean some of the
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
while I I can make an statement about
 
02:05:05.549 --> 02:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
that keep in mind that the two caucuses
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
May conclude something else and then we
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
change our path but right now it feels
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
like we'll be executing it okay I'm
 
02:05:15.549 --> 02:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
going to close the work session on uh HB
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
1429 we now open the work session on hb4
 
02:05:21.470 --> 02:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
1970 establishing a study committee on
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
the feasibility and impact of lowi
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
income housing credit excuse me Mr chair
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
yeah um I have an amendment for 1470 may
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.679 --> 02:05:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.599 --> 02:06:23.790 align:start position:0%
 
pissed

02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:29.470 --> 02:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
yes there there weren't huge changes to
 
02:06:34.549 --> 02:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
this so I'd just like to draw your
 
02:06:38.669 --> 02:06:38.679 align:start position:0%
attention to the changes we've made um
 
02:06:41.229 --> 02:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
on line
 
02:06:41.239 --> 02:06:43.069 align:start position:0%
on line
nine

02:06:43.069 --> 02:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
nine
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
um it also refers to instead of just
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
low-income housing we added and
 
02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing um and that same
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
change is reflected at line
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
20 um at line
 
02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
13 um we clarified that three members of
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
the house would be um appointed by the
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
speaker and three members by the
 
02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:09.350 align:start position:0%
speaker and three members by the
minority

02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
minority
 
02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
leader and um at line
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
19 I think this is reflected above and I
 
02:07:18.910 --> 02:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
missed it um the duties of the committee
 
02:07:21.149 --> 02:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
uh they would study the impact of a tax
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
credit and other incentives we added and
 
02:07:30.189 --> 02:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
I think that um Committee Member Aly may
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
remember other changes that were made
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:50.310 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
I see everybody diligently looking at it
 
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
so I
 
02:07:53.960 --> 02:08:17.310 align:start position:0%
so I
will

02:08:17.310 --> 02:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
wait yeah
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:41.629 --> 02:08:41.639 align:start position:0%
comments yes I'm good with the changes I
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
Bill yes I would ask the question is
 
02:08:52.109 --> 02:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
anyone familiar with whether we have had
 
02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
committees studying this or whether we
 
02:08:57.149 --> 02:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
have a committee in prog in process
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
right now or not can I respond I know
 
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
that on Friday um this coming Friday
 
02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
there are two meetings um about the
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
topic of housing okay one being by the
 
02:09:08.639 --> 02:09:10.030 align:start position:0%
topic of housing okay one being by the
special

02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
special
 
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
committee not it's not a study committee
 
02:09:17.229 --> 02:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
of this particular issue like this bill
 
02:09:19.709 --> 02:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
recommends but there are are going to be
 
02:09:21.229 --> 02:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
I believe two different meetings on
 
02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:31.709 --> 02:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
broadly represent spillsbury
 
02:09:34.589 --> 02:09:34.599 align:start position:0%
so what's the advantage of creating a
 
02:09:36.549 --> 02:09:36.559 align:start position:0%
study committee when the speaker already
 
02:09:38.549 --> 02:09:38.559 align:start position:0%
created a special committee specifically
 
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
to focus on this
 
02:09:42.750 --> 02:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
issue that was my question so there is a
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
can't hear the conversation
 
02:09:55.109 --> 02:09:55.119 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry I thought my mic was on
 
02:09:58.510 --> 02:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
I say the special committee um broadly
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
focuses on housing
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
needs you saying there is a special
 
02:10:06.549 --> 02:10:06.559 align:start position:0%
committee already focusing on this may I
 
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
respond yes so this committee is um
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
looking at tax credits and other
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
incentives to increase the availability
 
02:10:17.189 --> 02:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
of low-income housing which I think is a
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
low-income housing and Workforce housing
 
02:10:22.350 --> 02:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
which I think is more specific um I know
 
02:10:24.790 --> 02:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
that the meetings on Friday I see that
 
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative Ames is is looking I
 
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
think that they're all speaking to bills
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
that are currently um being considered
 
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
so I think there it might be a public
 
02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
hearing about bills it might be a work
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
session but this committee is
 
02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
specifically looking at increasing the
 
02:10:42.270 --> 02:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
Ava availability of low-income housing
 
02:10:44.430 --> 02:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
and Workforce housing which I think is
 
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
is a more specific charge than the
 
02:10:49.870 --> 02:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
overall housing you know ex housing
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
market um that currently exists I
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
believe representative fellow did you um
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative Ames I just uh I I
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
was looking at that yes um I believe the
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
special committee on housing is a
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee to which bills that relate to
 
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
the subject matter of that H housing
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
committee are assigned for review and
 
02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:22.119 align:start position:0%
action like our our committee is but
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's got a this focus on housing uh so
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's reviewing bills I don't think
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's studying an issue like the issue
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's proposed in this bill uh for a a
 
02:11:37.390 --> 02:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
focused review and uh
 
02:11:41.709 --> 02:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
think representative
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
Aly yes um it seems to to be
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
concentrating on
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
zoning and other
 
02:11:59.069 --> 02:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
judicial uh on Municipal and judicial
 
02:12:03.229 --> 02:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
difficulties with that stop housing in
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
general more than than this specific
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
issue which is the lower income
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
workers okay um
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
which they may get to if they keep doing
 
02:12:21.149 --> 02:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
terms may I add in sure um it's now
 
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
coming back to me that I a lot of the
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
ongoing conversation that I'm aware of
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
um in my own City and and at the state
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
level is about zoning and how we can fix
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
zoning so that we can build more housing
 
02:12:38.189 --> 02:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
and and I think that this one is not
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
particularly um focused on zoning um but
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
really on low-income and Workforce
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
housing which I think can be impacted by
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
zoning um um decisions but certainly is
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
is broader and really deals with kind of
 
02:12:56.589 --> 02:12:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh the broader Workforce issue that
 
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Ames did you have
 
02:13:05.790 --> 02:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
a further
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
comment I don't think I I I was just
 
02:13:11.629 --> 02:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
looking up what's in excuse me what
 
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
what's in our
 
02:13:17.790 --> 02:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
um on the the general Court's website
 
02:13:19.709 --> 02:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire housing standing
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
committees the special committee on
 
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
housing is identified and its membership
 
02:13:25.870 --> 02:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
is identified but there's not
 
02:13:30.549 --> 02:13:30.559 align:start position:0%
any I was pursuant to house R 31 so you
 
02:13:31.950 --> 02:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
bear with
 
02:13:36.430 --> 02:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
that does anybody else have something
 
02:13:40.589 --> 02:13:40.599 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury it was my
 
02:13:41.709 --> 02:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
understanding that that special
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee was given a charge to look
 
02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensively at means of dealing with
 
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing this bill is this
 
02:13:54.030 --> 02:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
amendment is now proposing to broaden
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
the Horizon of this study committee to
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
include Workforce housing and makes that
 
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:08.830 --> 02:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
oh I we have two definitions of
 
02:14:17.229 --> 02:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
Workforce in people's minds on
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have the general
 
02:14:22.109 --> 02:14:22.119 align:start position:0%
Workforce and we have the workforce
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
housing definition that we put in about
 
02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
15 years ago on that uh
 
02:14:34.910 --> 02:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
codified a Judicial decision
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
on and that definition is for usually
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
most of it is
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
60% of the median income can
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
afford this item so it's a lot of
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
workers but they are the workers that
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
have the hardest time being able to stay
 
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
in New
 
02:15:03.149 --> 02:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is why we don't have
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
enough people doing the wells we don't
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
have enough people doing the septic
 
02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
systems we don't have enough people
 
02:15:12.910 --> 02:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
doing the electricity uh we don't have
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
enough people on
 
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:18.589 align:start position:0%

Roofing
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
in this state and we that's it's a major
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
housing issue of its own as well as
 
02:15:27.870 --> 02:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
being an issue
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
for enough Baristas
 
02:15:35.709 --> 02:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
enough girls in dance halls
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
whatever I mean it seems to me that from
 
02:15:40.629 --> 02:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
my perspective one of the one of the
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
major things here is is there is there
 
02:15:47.069 --> 02:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
overlap how much overlap and is it
 
02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
covered for now Now by what we have
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
going representative Ames I'd like to
 
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
comment on that we did have testimony
 
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
from Ben
 
02:15:58.510 --> 02:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
Frost um who the New Hampshire what's
 
02:16:00.669 --> 02:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:16:05.870 --> 02:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
you Housing Finance Authority and uh I I
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
know him from other appearances before
 
02:16:10.030 --> 02:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
this committee over the years he's one
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the most knowledgeable people I think
 
02:16:17.189 --> 02:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
in in uh this field and an excellent uh
 
02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:20.599 align:start position:0%
proponent of um good housing policy and
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
he came before us to say that yeah this
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh this was needed that uh essentially
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
saying there's not not another Endeavor
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's overlapping this um and was
 
02:16:36.190 --> 02:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
recommending that we go forward with it
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
I take that recommendation as
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
substantial and persuasive to
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
me representative fellows um yes on
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same line I agree when
 
02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
when we have bills people from the state
 
02:16:54.549 --> 02:16:54.559 align:start position:0%
departments and the Finance Authority
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
they they come in here and they almost
 
02:16:58.750 --> 02:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
always say I don't have an opinion you
 
02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
know I'm not supporting or or being
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to a particular bill I think
 
02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:08.519 align:start position:0%
when you have a study com commission or
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
committee that that's an opportunity for
 
02:17:14.349 --> 02:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
them to tell you what they really think
 
02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:25.309 --> 02:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
okay um seeing no more hands we'll close
 
02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
1470 now opening the uh work session on
 
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
HP 1613 establishing a trust fund for
 
02:17:41.469 --> 02:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:46.589 --> 02:17:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:46.599 --> 02:17:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
contamination

02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
Amy thank you we have a slight problem
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
we've lost representative
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
news that is we can't find
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
him and um we we don't know whether he
 
02:18:10.469 --> 02:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
02:18:13.790 --> 02:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
amend uh his bill
 
02:18:16.990 --> 02:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
further after reading the commissioner's
 
02:18:19.790 --> 02:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
letter or whether he felt that he'd
 
02:18:22.629 --> 02:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
already covered
 
02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
it was he asked for an
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
amendment actually we do have an
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
amendment from him yeah we
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
do um and it's from the middle of
 
02:18:36.030 --> 02:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
February and the commissioner's letter
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
is from the end of February oh no end of
 
02:18:43.150 --> 02:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
January but I think he just got it when
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
he arrived here to
 
02:18:46.519 --> 02:18:49.270 align:start position:0%
he arrived here to
speak

02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:18:51.389 --> 02:18:51.399 align:start position:0%
I say we can't find him and that's we've
 
02:18:55.589 --> 02:18:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:59.190 --> 02:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
day and and um and the question is what
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
whether there's a
 
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
further whether because of the
 
02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner's letter there were some
 
02:19:08.429 --> 02:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
other things that he would have wanted
 
02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
to put into the
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.439 --> 02:19:18.389 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:19:20.429 --> 02:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if we could delay this
 
02:19:20.439 --> 02:19:21.669 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if we could delay this
one

02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
until I guess it would have to be the
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
week after next because next week we're
 
02:19:29.349 --> 02:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:35.790 --> 02:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
is no um no not necessarily what do you
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
mean just property tax no we're doing um
 
02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
we're not just doing the swept bills no
 
02:19:48.910 --> 02:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
so we could try to to get we could get a
 
02:19:51.070 --> 02:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
hold of them by then I
 
02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:55.910 align:start position:0%
hold of them by then I
hope

02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
yeah how do how do people feel about
 
02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
this in general um say later
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
list put it on the later list so at
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
least he can have a chance if he does
 
02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:15.389 align:start position:0%
least he can have a chance if he does
have

02:20:15.389 --> 02:20:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
something all right then uh let's let's
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
close the work session on this um at
 
02:20:25.710 --> 02:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
1613 open the work session on hb1 1410
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:46.319 --> 02:20:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
licenses

02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
represent Aly if you look at the 229
 
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note they have essentially said
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
that that what they the only real loss
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
they're likely to get is going to be
 
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:19.230 align:start position:0%
they're likely to get is going to be
95,000

02:21:19.230 --> 02:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
95,000
 
02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
in the next bium which they were
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
thinking of sticking into their
 
02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
budget right which is kind of um virtual
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever based on yesterday's
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
testimony the the fiscal impact was uh
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:43.870 --> 02:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
stated any other comments on this uh on
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
this bill I never got that Ro recent
 
02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:49.790 align:start position:0%
this bill I never got that Ro recent
fiscal

02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
and yeah I don't have it either
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
oh sorry 95 from 9 I take that back I
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
gave him mine I'll take the here's
 
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:13.389 --> 02:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
one anybody else needs
 
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
one that's that's my collection of stuff
 
02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
I'm going to throw all right any other
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
represent he did change the bill was
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
changed just to deal with medical
 
02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
technicians on the
 
02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
financial yeah decrease that the state
 
02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:36.429 align:start position:0%
financial yeah decrease that the state
would

02:22:36.429 --> 02:22:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:36.439 --> 02:22:42.230 align:start position:0%
 
face

02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:45.070 --> 02:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
right it was amended before it came to
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
our committee yeah
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay are we all set on
 
02:22:54.270 --> 02:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
this okay we'll close the uh work
 
02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
1410 I'll open the work session on hb1
 
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
1655 and I'll REM uh okay actually we we
 
02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
02:23:16.510 --> 02:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
1655 and um it looks like barring the
 
02:23:19.830 --> 02:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
ability to get an amendment today which
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
sounds challenging uh we would take that
 
02:23:27.469 --> 02:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:33.469 --> 02:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
1655 open the work session on 1198
 
02:23:39.710 --> 02:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
relative to liquor stores and that was
 
02:23:39.720 --> 02:23:41.389 align:start position:0%
relative to liquor stores and that was
the

02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
Christmas thanksgiv Easter um openings
 
02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
and um the
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
policy was approved obviously it's a
 
02:23:53.349 --> 02:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
second committee Bill however we did
 
02:23:56.150 --> 02:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
have some question yesterday about um
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
does this increase revenue does it not
 
02:24:00.750 --> 02:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
increase Revenue um
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative PL the answer to
 
02:24:08.190 --> 02:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
my answer is I don't know uh but uh yeah
 
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
but but New Hampshire Liquor Commission
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't know but but uh but they have
 
02:24:16.110 --> 02:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
find that maybe won't be any increase in
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue but uh
 
02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
if I if this bill passes I think they'
 
02:24:22.349 --> 02:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
try in couple of major stores to see
 
02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
what kind of revenues they did get and
 
02:24:27.630 --> 02:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
what and what what revenues uh decreased
 
02:24:29.469 --> 02:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
in the days leading up to it and see if
 
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
there's a net benefit it's enabling leg
 
02:24:34.590 --> 02:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation only but they have
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
the choice to open or not open right
 
02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:38.990 align:start position:0%
the choice to open or not open right
representative

02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
alberger thank you Mr chairman I I agree
 
02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
with representative F flet this is
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
simply a way for the Liquor Commission
 
02:24:48.670 --> 02:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
to figure figure out do we make more
 
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
money or not and given that I think it's
 
02:24:56.349 --> 02:24:56.359 align:start position:0%
fine thank you representative Amy and I
 
02:24:58.750 --> 02:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
agree but I think that the Liquor
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
Commission feels that they do know that
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't that it's going to would lose
 
02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
them money and they probably won't do it
 
02:25:08.030 --> 02:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
but they'll have the option for the
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
future if they want to do it
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
later thank you I'm going to close the
 
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
work session on oh one more yeah I I
 
02:25:19.790 --> 02:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
believe I heard two comments yesterday
 
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
where there may have been just a little
 
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
bit of a confusion so um to
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
clarify if it's
 
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
helpful so the this bill removes a
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
restriction as to only three holidays
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
Easter Thanksgiving or Christmas what
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
that leaves is the first part of the
 
02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
sentence and so it does apply to all
 
02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:44.150 align:start position:0%
sentence and so it does apply to all
legal

02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
legal
 
02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
holidays in other right so by removing
 
02:25:50.590 --> 02:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
the Restriction Liquor Commission would
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
have discretion on Sundays and any legal
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
holiday and another comment was made
 
02:25:59.349 --> 02:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
about how how much overtime is required
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
if it's a holiday versus if it's a
 
02:26:06.030 --> 02:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
Sunday but the the last sentence in uh
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
8910 specifically pegs it at one and a
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
half times and by
 
02:26:17.389 --> 02:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
saying um on such days that mean one and
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
a half times is the rule both for
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:29.389 --> 02:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
holiday represent fellows so one of the
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
questions I had about this yesterday had
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
to do with that part about the one and a
 
02:26:37.950 --> 02:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
half time pay because I you know I don't
 
02:26:39.469 --> 02:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
know for sure I can't tell you where
 
02:26:42.590 --> 02:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's written but it seems to me that
 
02:26:46.190 --> 02:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
it's a common practice that one and a
 
02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
half time times pay is for over 40 hours
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
but when um there's a holiday when the
 
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
rest of the people when in an
 
02:26:58.269 --> 02:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
organization would normally have off and
 
02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
people work overtime or on a holiday
 
02:27:04.349 --> 02:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
that their rate may be higher than one
 
02:27:06.910 --> 02:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
and a half times and that that is
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
controlled by usually by um the
 
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
contract the LA that the labor union has
 
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
um NE negotiated I'm particularly I'm
 
02:27:20.110 --> 02:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
thinking of the state hospital seems to
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
me that's where I heard it that context
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
that when they work um on a holiday in
 
02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
at the state hospital it's more than a
 
02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
time and a half so if we put in statute
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
paid at time and a half well this is for
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
liquor but I I don't know I don't know
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
what the contracts currently call for so
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
that's just a
 
02:27:44.190 --> 02:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
concern represent Bolton thank you Mr
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
chair so in representative Horgan
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
testimony he did say in paragraph 4 that
 
02:27:52.030 --> 02:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
the commission is free to keep the
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
stores closed instead and then full-time
 
02:27:56.429 --> 02:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
employees would be guaranteed at least
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
one and a half times the regular pay and
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
all the work rules would still apply so
 
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
I think that might be an error that his
 
02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
testimony doesn't match how the bill is
 
02:28:07.950 --> 02:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
actually written and I I agree with u
 
02:28:10.110 --> 02:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellows that it might be
 
02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
contrary to contractual
 
02:28:12.319 --> 02:28:15.630 align:start position:0%
contrary to contractual
agreements

02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:28:18.790 --> 02:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
okay represented
 
02:28:26.630 --> 02:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
Ames microphone way microphone
 
02:28:29.550 --> 02:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
please this this
 
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh bill as representa spilsbury has has
 
02:28:38.429 --> 02:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
pointed out leaves in place it removes a
 
02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
a a
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh a restriction on three days but
 
02:28:47.710 --> 02:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
leaves in place
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
all the other language which um has been
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
in place for a long time and uh so the
 
02:28:57.590 --> 02:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
Restriction the statutory restriction of
 
02:29:01.389 --> 02:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
one and a half times has been there and
 
02:29:03.550 --> 02:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
um whatever the rules may be for
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
additional overtime and how interplay
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
between this statutory provision and
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps a collective bargaining
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
agreement I don't know but uh no there's
 
02:29:16.950 --> 02:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
no change here we're just uh allowing
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
this uh liquor stores to operate on
 
02:29:23.469 --> 02:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:26.670 --> 02:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
days right we're assuming that language
 
02:29:28.030 --> 02:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
was already there and has been
 
02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:31.590 align:start position:0%
was already there and has been
instituted

02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
yeah represent
 
02:29:37.070 --> 02:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
Southworth H thank you it seems like it
 
02:29:39.269 --> 02:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
would be easy to just find out from The
 
02:29:41.550 --> 02:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission what they pay on
 
02:29:43.870 --> 02:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
holidays again I think it is 1 and a
 
02:29:47.630 --> 02:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
half% um but people question if there's
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
a discrepancy it's easy to ask them you
 
02:29:52.110 --> 02:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
know they have the contract they've been
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
paying people all year um and it may be
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
that the match is fine but we don't know
 
02:30:00.349 --> 02:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
so we can just ask them
 
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
right well to represent am point this is
 
02:30:08.269 --> 02:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
this was already in
 
02:30:11.230 --> 02:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
the so really perhaps you just know
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
other agencies but if this is the fiscal
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
note if that is absolutely correct we
 
02:30:17.469 --> 02:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
really don't have to worry about it it's
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:26.429 --> 02:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
us changing that part of the bill is not
 
02:30:26.439 --> 02:30:30.510 align:start position:0%
us changing that part of the bill is not
before

02:30:30.510 --> 02:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:32.110 align:start position:0%
 
us

02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:30:35.070 --> 02:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
okay anything else on
 
02:30:37.870 --> 02:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
that saying none close the work session
 
02:30:42.750 --> 02:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:45.630 --> 02:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
1198 now open the work session on hb1
 
02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:47.269 align:start position:0%
1198 now open the work session on hb1
129

02:30:47.269 --> 02:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
129
 
02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
3 um and I'll remind everyone that
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
this has no fiscal note and probably
 
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
could have been waved and not come to
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
our committee so um technically speaking
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
it would it would just be an
 
02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
OTP um
 
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
unless I don't see any one okay all
 
02:31:12.349 --> 02:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
right we'll close the work session on
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
1293 HB 1303 I'll open that one
 
02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the state of
 
02:31:22.349 --> 02:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
testi B I know I'm not saying that right
 
02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative PL my guess would
 
02:31:28.110 --> 02:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
be uh Toy
 
02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
Banu so anyway my only question I I have
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
no problem but only question is how much
 
02:31:36.830 --> 02:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
was the money involved it's 150,000
 
02:31:38.670 --> 02:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
comes to mind but yeah something
 
02:31:40.670 --> 02:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
something in that range
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:45.359 --> 02:31:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:31:46.990 --> 02:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
any comments I think we can pretty much
 
02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
put this one to rest
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay end of work
 
02:31:58.910 --> 02:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
session uh open the work session on
 
02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
1565 relative the definition of
 
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
food uh I think that one is pretty
 
02:32:08.030 --> 02:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
straightforward as well you know when I
 
02:32:11.429 --> 02:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
object to agriculture calling pickles
 
02:32:13.389 --> 02:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
hasd all right you all have to take that
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
up with
 
02:32:15.279 --> 02:32:18.309 align:start position:0%
up with
them

02:32:18.309 --> 02:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
any comments on that
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
one seeing none I'll close work
 
02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:33.269 --> 02:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
16 H I'll open the work session HB
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
1709 uh that again falls into the same
 
02:32:39.269 --> 02:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
category there's no longer fiscal note
 
02:32:39.279 --> 02:32:40.790 align:start position:0%
category there's no longer fiscal note
that

02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:32:43.550 --> 02:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
um that should have been waved as well
 
02:32:46.750 --> 02:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
so we can move on from that one
 
02:32:49.269 --> 02:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
seeing no dissension I'll close the work
 
02:32:51.950 --> 02:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:54.910 --> 02:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
1709 all right last but not least hb1
 
02:32:58.030 --> 02:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
1611 I'll open the work session on that
 
02:33:00.030 --> 02:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
Rel to establishing a child care
 
02:33:00.040 --> 02:33:15.150 align:start position:0%
Rel to establishing a child care
Workforce

02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:35.389 align:start position:0%
 
fund

02:33:35.389 --> 02:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:35.399 --> 02:33:36.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:33:40.670 --> 02:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
Aly yes um I have had conversation with
 
02:33:45.230 --> 02:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
Mary Jane Walmer who is one of the uh
 
02:33:49.269 --> 02:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
people involved in the child care uh
 
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
special committee as well as
 
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
um representative MC Williams who wasn't
 
02:34:00.670 --> 02:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
able to come on
 
02:34:02.429 --> 02:34:02.439 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
reason they've put this together in a
 
02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
way that will fit what the Senate
 
02:34:17.150 --> 02:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
promised would be another
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation next year and that would
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
take it out of the hands of
 
02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:26.309 align:start position:0%
take it out of the hands of
HHS

02:34:26.309 --> 02:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
HHS
 
02:34:29.070 --> 02:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
on partly because they think it will be
 
02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:30.429 align:start position:0%
on partly because they think it will be
more

02:34:30.429 --> 02:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
efficient as as a independent
 
02:34:39.710 --> 02:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
um what they they call a designated
 
02:34:43.870 --> 02:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
entity that would do it uh in the same
 
02:34:48.670 --> 02:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
sort of way that um all of
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
those those uh
 
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
voucher School vouchers have been put
 
02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
into the hands of an
 
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:06.750 align:start position:0%
 
transparency

02:35:06.750 --> 02:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
02:35:11.870 --> 02:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
and that it is set up so that that
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
entity can will be making grants to
 
02:35:17.230 --> 02:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
child care employ
 
02:35:21.389 --> 02:35:21.399 align:start position:0%
lawyers who can do any of a number of
 
02:35:24.389 --> 02:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
things that sug say that they are going
 
02:35:27.550 --> 02:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
to want to do any of a number of things
 
02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
that they think will be most helpful to
 
02:35:33.870 --> 02:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
them for expanding the
 
02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:35.510 align:start position:0%
them for expanding the
workforce

02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
02:35:38.670 --> 02:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
um which is why there's this whole list
 
02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:40.590 align:start position:0%
um which is why there's this whole list
of

02:35:40.590 --> 02:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:43.190 align:start position:0%
of
them

02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
and I must admit when I was was reading
 
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
this I had misunderstood a whole lot of
 
02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
it because I don't do child
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
care so I just wanted
 
02:36:00.550 --> 02:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
to oh and and one other
 
02:36:03.309 --> 02:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
qualific uh thing that I learned from
 
02:36:07.309 --> 02:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
her page two on they've got the child
 
02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
care programs operating in New Hampshire
 
02:36:11.429 --> 02:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
with an Active Child Care license or
 
02:36:13.550 --> 02:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
license exempt and enrolled in the
 
02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:36:20.190 --> 02:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
child care scholarship program um and
 
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
they go as far as summer camp programs
 
02:36:28.910 --> 02:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
but uh the B turns out to be the Boys
 
02:36:30.429 --> 02:36:30.439 align:start position:0%
and Girls
 
02:36:35.389 --> 02:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
Club on a number a fairly large number
 
02:36:37.510 --> 02:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
apparently of years ago went to the
 
02:36:40.269 --> 02:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
legislature and managed to get EX itself
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
Exempted from
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
licensing and there are a few others
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
that are included in that that
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
category and
 
02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:52.479 align:start position:0%
so they would also be able to
 
02:36:56.550 --> 02:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
apply but so so what do we do with this
 
02:37:00.670 --> 02:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
bill well this is from the special
 
02:37:03.269 --> 02:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
committee uh even though they they
 
02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
started out at the beginning to say it
 
02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
says Health and Human Services and
 
02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs but it was sent to the
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
special committee on Child Care um this
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
see I think is their main work product
 
02:37:16.479 --> 02:37:18.150 align:start position:0%
see I think is their main work product
this

02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
year so I I am Child Care is the second
 
02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
highest priority of the Bia after
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
housing to do something about and I
 
02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:33.150 align:start position:0%
housing to do something about and I
would

02:37:33.150 --> 02:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:37:37.389 --> 02:37:37.399 align:start position:0%
hate not to do something about it and
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
they do seem to have have their heads
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
together about what is going to happen
 
02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:44.790 align:start position:0%
together about what is going to happen
with

02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:47.070 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:37:47.070 --> 02:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:37:50.429 --> 02:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative duet okay um just
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
very briefly and and bia's been referred
 
02:37:59.230 --> 02:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
to a couple times but um they you know I
 
02:38:01.309 --> 02:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
would I would hope we we were talking
 
02:38:03.269 --> 02:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
about I think it was 1193 where we
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get any testimony from the Bia we
 
02:38:08.670 --> 02:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
didn't get any from them yesterday also
 
02:38:10.910 --> 02:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
about six uh
 
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
1611 my reservation with this is and I I
 
02:38:16.750 --> 02:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
we all can acknowledge we have huge
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
issues with child
 
02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:21.830 align:start position:0%
issues with child
care

02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:26.110 --> 02:38:26.120 align:start position:0%
but for me setting up a a blank check
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
approach with the testimony we heard
 
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
from I'm not sure as to who's doing the
 
02:38:33.190 --> 02:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
grant writing for the state but they got
 
02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
a grant for $15 million I I wasn't
 
02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:39.429 align:start position:0%
a grant for $15 million I I wasn't
convinced

02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
that the the benefit of this quite
 
02:38:43.950 --> 02:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
frankly personally myself unless
 
02:38:45.710 --> 02:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
somebody can can convince me other
 
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise what this does is sets up
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
another dedicated
 
02:38:49.439 --> 02:38:51.550 align:start position:0%
another dedicated
fund

02:38:51.550 --> 02:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
and um I'm just not entirely comfortable
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
with it as to what I heard yes yesterday
 
02:39:01.070 --> 02:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
testified in front of us could I correct
 
02:39:06.349 --> 02:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a $15 million grant that was
 
02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
the state senate putting into the budget
 
02:39:14.349 --> 02:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
$15 million for child care okay I stand
 
02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
corrected I in order to uh start the
 
02:39:21.910 --> 02:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
work and they they sent it to
 
02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
HHS to do something the first year so
 
02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
that they'd get started and then on they
 
02:39:34.590 --> 02:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
also put in apparently into the finance
 
02:39:39.269 --> 02:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
committee Budget on which is so huge I
 
02:39:41.429 --> 02:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't blame anybody on the finance
 
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
committee if they didn't notice it but
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
they put in at the same time something
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
that said that we intend this to be
 
02:39:54.190 --> 02:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing that every term they were going
 
02:39:57.910 --> 02:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
to do that now they can't tell the next
 
02:39:59.630 --> 02:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
Senate what to do anymore than we can
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
tell the next house what to do but that
 
02:40:05.309 --> 02:40:05.319 align:start position:0%
was they put their intention there in
 
02:40:05.319 --> 02:40:06.150 align:start position:0%
was they put their intention there in
the

02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:40:09.630 --> 02:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
budget I'm just if I may I'm just being
 
02:40:12.670 --> 02:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
transparent it was an appropriation set
 
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
setting up a a dedicated fund is
 
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
something I'm very timid about so I'm
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
just being very transparent right
 
02:40:24.510 --> 02:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
now or at least I'm trying
 
02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:31.790 align:start position:0%
now or at least I'm trying
to

02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chair um a couple
 
02:40:38.670 --> 02:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
things appear a little bit different to
 
02:40:40.150 --> 02:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
me about this bill than some of the
 
02:40:42.190 --> 02:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
other ones we've discussed one is that
 
02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
$50 million was appropriated by the
 
02:40:48.429 --> 02:40:48.439 align:start position:0%
state to to this ends this year so
 
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
whereas some of the other things we've
 
02:40:53.630 --> 02:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
talked about we we haven't seen that and
 
02:40:56.830 --> 02:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
it's been acknowledged by you know
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state both sides of the
 
02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
aisle that this is a really important
 
02:41:03.429 --> 02:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
issue this is product of a special
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee who put a lot of work and
 
02:41:07.269 --> 02:41:07.279 align:start position:0%
thought into it and we had a lot of
 
02:41:09.950 --> 02:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
testimony from our citizens in support
 
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
of this bill the other reason I think we
 
02:41:16.349 --> 02:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
should support it is that we have DHHS
 
02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
funnels Federal money to support
 
02:41:23.230 --> 02:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
lowincome families to be able to get
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
their kids in daycare so that they can
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
go to work and it seems like this
 
02:41:30.469 --> 02:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
approach supports the businesses that
 
02:41:33.309 --> 02:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
are running daycares and you know I know
 
02:41:35.469 --> 02:41:35.479 align:start position:0%
some folks who run daycares and they
 
02:41:38.110 --> 02:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
need support So it seems like it it
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
provides a balance to what we already um
 
02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
are doing to make this continue to be a
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
viable business uh in our state so it it
 
02:41:53.070 --> 02:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
does seem a little bit different to me
 
02:41:55.950 --> 02:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
and I think the bill is quite good while
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
not perfect but
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
um I think that the Senate is working on
 
02:42:03.309 --> 02:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
the same thing I understand and so maybe
 
02:42:04.830 --> 02:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
02:42:07.309 --> 02:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
perfected um later on but I don't want
 
02:42:10.230 --> 02:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
to get in the way of this bill passing
 
02:42:12.750 --> 02:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
especially because it has no impact as
 
02:42:14.349 --> 02:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
it's written right
 
02:42:14.359 --> 02:42:17.349 align:start position:0%
it's written right
now

02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative Ames followed by
 
02:42:23.429 --> 02:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
Elberta yeah I I Echo the comments that
 
02:42:26.910 --> 02:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
we just made and um and I don't think
 
02:42:29.269 --> 02:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's been said but this is a a
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Bill strong support from both
 
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle and that's nice when
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
that happens um and um the underlying
 
02:42:42.990 --> 02:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
issue we all know is uh urgent and uh
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
makes uh addressing it and making a dent
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
in uh the problems people have because
 
02:42:53.230 --> 02:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
of the absence of affordable child care
 
02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:55.030 align:start position:0%
of the absence of affordable child care
is

02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:42:58.710 --> 02:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
um import will will help the state in a
 
02:43:02.429 --> 02:43:02.439 align:start position:0%
big way and so um I I hope that we can
 
02:43:05.550 --> 02:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
go forward with this we we didn't have
 
02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh any opposition that I can recall
 
02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
um other than some questions that were
 
02:43:14.670 --> 02:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
asked by members here appropriate
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
questions um I think we're getting
 
02:43:19.230 --> 02:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
beyond that we should just go forward
 
02:43:23.230 --> 02:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
with it as good it's a it's a uh a start
 
02:43:24.990 --> 02:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not going to solve all the
 
02:43:26.830 --> 02:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
problems in the world but it's a start
 
02:43:28.469 --> 02:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
and I think we
 
02:43:31.950 --> 02:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
should enable it representative
 
02:43:34.830 --> 02:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair this bill
 
02:43:36.309 --> 02:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
also helps a different group of
 
02:43:38.910 --> 02:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
employers and those are the employers
 
02:43:42.750 --> 02:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
who can't find people to fill their jobs
 
02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
because they're these potential
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
employees can't get child care so if you
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
look at the whole piece of it if we have
 
02:43:55.870 --> 02:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
the providers who have been telling us
 
02:43:59.070 --> 02:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
they have empty rooms because they can't
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
pay their staff they'll be able to hire
 
02:44:05.230 --> 02:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
more people and those parents can then
 
02:44:06.830 --> 02:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
fill some of the jobs that are going
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
wanting now so I think this uh is a
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
winwin for a whole whole lot of
 
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
groups um representative uh fores
 
02:44:18.349 --> 02:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
followed by spilsbury thank you so yeah
 
02:44:20.590 --> 02:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
my only concern I mean I sympathize with
 
02:44:22.710 --> 02:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
what I heard the other day my concern is
 
02:44:24.790 --> 02:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
if we start funding this group what
 
02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
what's the next group I don't know
 
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's my concern so I I man it sounds
 
02:44:33.389 --> 02:44:33.399 align:start position:0%
like such a tough situation but I don't
 
02:44:36.550 --> 02:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
know that government involvement is the
 
02:44:40.670 --> 02:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
answer represent spilsbury thank you Mr
 
02:44:44.309 --> 02:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
chairman we we heard yesterday that uh a
 
02:44:49.349 --> 02:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
prime difficulty with hiring and uh
 
02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
retaining daycare workers is pay that
 
02:44:55.110 --> 02:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
they're competing unsuccessfully with
 
02:44:56.790 --> 02:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
Walmart and McDonald's that they would
 
02:45:00.150 --> 02:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
need another $5 an hour I mean these are
 
02:45:02.349 --> 02:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
really deep problems in terms of the way
 
02:45:05.590 --> 02:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
the competitive Marketplace for for
 
02:45:08.190 --> 02:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
Labor uh operates but what does this
 
02:45:09.870 --> 02:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
bill propose to
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
do it's using the mechanism of another
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
one of these empty vessels a of an
 
02:45:18.830 --> 02:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
unfunded fund that's going to be again
 
02:45:20.990 --> 02:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
like so many non-aps and continually
 
02:45:23.429 --> 02:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
appropriated so it doesn't get by anal
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
review in the Appropriations process and
 
02:45:31.230 --> 02:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
then it it asks the designated
 
02:45:36.910 --> 02:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
entity to look at the specific uh uses
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
listed in lines 19
 
02:45:42.670 --> 02:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
through3 with the purpose of Staff
 
02:45:44.429 --> 02:45:44.439 align:start position:0%
retention and Recruitment and and I'm
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
looking at this specific list and I'm it
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to
 
02:45:53.950 --> 02:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
me why some of these background checks
 
02:45:56.110 --> 02:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
uh professional cost
 
02:45:59.670 --> 02:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
CPR uh Health dental uh Whole Life
 
02:46:02.510 --> 02:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
vision insurance paid time off
 
02:46:04.990 --> 02:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
equivalent I don't see
 
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
how spending uh grant money on any of
 
02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
those things really addresses the
 
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
fundamental flaw in the employment um
 
02:46:15.950 --> 02:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
competitive employment Market
 
02:46:17.790 --> 02:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
sure at least it's to some of them I'm
 
02:46:23.790 --> 02:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
asking is this really going to help to
 
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain daycare workers or is
 
02:46:28.110 --> 02:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
it in some cases going to prepare day
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
workers to go take flight and go
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere else with the new newly
 
02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
acquired skills so I I would leave it at
 
02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
that I'm just very very troubled at how
 
02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
completely open-ended it is there's no
 
02:46:43.790 --> 02:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
real criteria for what the value the
 
02:46:46.670 --> 02:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
impact is and how one one qualifies it's
 
02:46:48.790 --> 02:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
one of the most wide openen programs
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
I've seen come across our
 
02:46:54.550 --> 02:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
desk and finally I just don't see any
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
limiting criteria here there's nothing
 
02:46:59.309 --> 02:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
that says you know up to $1,000 per
 
02:47:02.510 --> 02:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
individual per year uh or or anything
 
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
else so uh you know let's just say that
 
02:47:08.309 --> 02:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
we passed this and next year let's just
 
02:47:11.510 --> 02:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
say the legislature puts $15 million
 
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
into this fund and now what exactly are
 
02:47:17.309 --> 02:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
we expecting this designated entity to
 
02:47:19.469 --> 02:47:19.479 align:start position:0%
go do and how did we Define their job
 
02:47:21.750 --> 02:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
and their
 
02:47:25.389 --> 02:47:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:28.230 --> 02:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
lley thank you
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative spillsbury I
 
02:47:32.710 --> 02:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
I agree with your concerns one of the
 
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
things I was looking for as I read this
 
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
bill were were caps um and there aren't
 
02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:41.830 align:start position:0%
bill were were caps um and there aren't
any

02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:44.469 --> 02:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
the what I appreciate about the bill is
 
02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
that it it feels like it does lay out
 
02:47:49.830 --> 02:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
some very clear
 
02:47:54.110 --> 02:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
um things for which employers can be in
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and those things seem to
 
02:48:00.309 --> 02:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
largely um align with quality so if
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
you're reimbursing people to get CPR
 
02:48:05.150 --> 02:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
training or reimbursing people to get uh
 
02:48:07.349 --> 02:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
additional education or conference
 
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
attendance then you're um supporting
 
02:48:11.950 --> 02:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
quality daycare which I think is
 
02:48:13.910 --> 02:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
something that that we want to do and I
 
02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
I do tend to compare it with um public
 
02:48:19.590 --> 02:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
education that is provided for children
 
02:48:22.590 --> 02:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
above age five
 
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
um when we give vouchers to those
 
02:48:28.389 --> 02:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
families we it is is much more wide open
 
02:48:30.910 --> 02:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
than this so it seems to me that that it
 
02:48:33.469 --> 02:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
is trying to
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
um not not only increase the
 
02:48:38.950 --> 02:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
availability of workers by by supporting
 
02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
them but increase the quality of those
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
workers by supporting specifically um
 
02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
education and when we support worker
 
02:48:47.670 --> 02:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
healthare obviously they can show up to
 
02:48:51.150 --> 02:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
work more so I I think that that what
 
02:48:54.389 --> 02:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
they're supporting is uh very
 
02:48:56.750 --> 02:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
advantageous um I too would have liked
 
02:48:59.830 --> 02:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
to see some caps thank
 
02:49:02.590 --> 02:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
you represent elberger followed by thank
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um representative
 
02:49:07.950 --> 02:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
spillsbury I want to clarify one of the
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
comments that you made you said there's
 
02:49:14.309 --> 02:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
no criteria and what types of criteria
 
02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:22.429 --> 02:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
to well there are eight
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
different um types of expenditure that
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
someone could theoretically claim and
 
02:49:30.950 --> 02:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
get a grant for right and there should
 
02:49:32.830 --> 02:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
be criteria for each of those eight I
 
02:49:35.389 --> 02:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
would want to engage you in a discussion
 
02:49:38.309 --> 02:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
one by one through the eight just give
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
me one
 
02:49:42.429 --> 02:49:42.439 align:start position:0%
please well child care tuition
 
02:49:48.910 --> 02:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:52.229 --> 02:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
PhD go ahead
 
02:49:56.750 --> 02:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh we have spent very large numbers of
 
02:50:00.670 --> 02:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars on education Freedom
 
02:50:03.670 --> 02:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
accounts which at this point have no
 
02:50:06.670 --> 02:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
caps there's no limit to how many
 
02:50:10.429 --> 02:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
children can apply for them uh as far as
 
02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
I can tell there are no criteria for
 
02:50:18.990 --> 02:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
evaluating the success or lack thereof
 
02:50:20.950 --> 02:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
of those accounts and we continue to
 
02:50:25.950 --> 02:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
fund them uh I believe that the
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
specific uh purposes for the funding
 
02:50:32.429 --> 02:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
that would come into
 
02:50:32.439 --> 02:50:33.950 align:start position:0%
that would come into
this

02:50:33.950 --> 02:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:50:38.150 --> 02:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh come through this bill are certainly
 
02:50:43.389 --> 02:50:43.399 align:start position:0%
as well defined and as reasonable as the
 
02:50:45.150 --> 02:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
way we're approaching the education
 
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts so I believe that we
 
02:50:52.070 --> 02:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
should be supporting this as well thank
 
02:50:55.510 --> 02:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair yes um just to speak
 
02:50:57.389 --> 02:50:57.399 align:start position:0%
specifically to the childcare tuition
 
02:50:59.110 --> 02:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
assistance that's something that I asked
 
02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
about um when we had the speakers
 
02:51:03.870 --> 02:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday and what that refers to is if
 
02:51:07.110 --> 02:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
a mother is working in child care and
 
02:51:09.190 --> 02:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
has a child of her own that needs to go
 
02:51:11.550 --> 02:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
to child care so she can go work at
 
02:51:13.950 --> 02:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
child care that that the tuition for her
 
02:51:15.389 --> 02:51:15.399 align:start position:0%
own child
 
02:51:18.550 --> 02:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
might be assisted so that she could uh
 
02:51:21.150 --> 02:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
work and my understanding of child care
 
02:51:23.710 --> 02:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
tuition discount is if you're working at
 
02:51:26.429 --> 02:51:26.439 align:start position:0%
a daycare you could tuition your own
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
child into that daycare at a discount so
 
02:51:32.110 --> 02:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
that it's it's just the ability of those
 
02:51:33.750 --> 02:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
people to go to
 
02:51:36.990 --> 02:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
work okay and yet there's also H not
 
02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:41.389 align:start position:0%
work okay and yet there's also H not
just

02:51:41.389 --> 02:51:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:43.710 --> 02:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
E I can see there's still a lot of
 
02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
discussion I can also see how this is
 
02:51:48.389 --> 02:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
playing out I just have a question on
 
02:51:51.630 --> 02:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
order hold on a second um so I'm going
 
02:51:54.429 --> 02:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
to take a few more but I also want to be
 
02:51:56.269 --> 02:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the fact that I want to
 
02:51:59.349 --> 02:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
start the exec session at 1:30 so I want
 
02:52:01.070 --> 02:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're not just you know
 
02:52:03.990 --> 02:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
repeating the same things and yes go
 
02:52:06.150 --> 02:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
ahead this is just it's not it's kind of
 
02:52:08.269 --> 02:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
off topic and actually it's relevant to
 
02:52:10.510 --> 02:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
an off topic discussion so just a
 
02:52:12.590 --> 02:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
question on Germain amendments versus
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
non-gain amendments um we're talking
 
02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
about 126a colon 17 if we were to
 
02:52:24.389 --> 02:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
amend another section of 126a be it
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
colon 16 15
 
02:52:30.309 --> 02:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
whatever does that constitute a non-gain
 
02:52:33.630 --> 02:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment or how how how close to the
 
02:52:36.150 --> 02:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
initial bill do we have to be in order
 
02:52:38.389 --> 02:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
to be considered
 
02:52:40.830 --> 02:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
Germain well at the end of the day the
 
02:52:42.750 --> 02:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
clerk's going to have to make that call
 
02:52:45.550 --> 02:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
if we're not sure what I've what I've
 
02:52:47.950 --> 02:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
understood is that if it's in the same
 
02:52:50.510 --> 02:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
section um then we're okay but if it's a
 
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
different section as you're saying then
 
02:52:56.389 --> 02:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
then we'd have to we'd have to get a a
 
02:52:57.389 --> 02:52:57.399 align:start position:0%
call on that because if it's not
 
02:52:58.990 --> 02:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
Germaine we need a public hearing right
 
02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.150 align:start position:0%
Germaine we need a public hearing right
thank

02:53:00.150 --> 02:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
you uh representative ORS followed by
 
02:53:05.389 --> 02:53:05.399 align:start position:0%
fellows yes thank you Mr chair so yeah
 
02:53:07.150 --> 02:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised the way this conversation
 
02:53:11.309 --> 02:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
went uh so number one number two I don't
 
02:53:12.910 --> 02:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
think we're going to advance it but I'm
 
02:53:15.190 --> 02:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
going to try you know I think part of
 
02:53:18.349 --> 02:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
the problem we have in our society is we
 
02:53:21.150 --> 02:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
are the richest Society in the world the
 
02:53:24.389 --> 02:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
poorest of the poor have the best of
 
02:53:26.309 --> 02:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
what most of the world would like to
 
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
have and as my wife would say if Sarah
 
02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
Johnson can rais 12 kids in a single
 
02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
room house you know maybe maybe the
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
father or the mother needs to stay home
 
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
and raise their own kids I mean that's
 
02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
what my wife and I did and we started a
 
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
homebased business and raised our kids I
 
02:53:48.269 --> 02:53:48.279 align:start position:0%
mean what the you know it's like maybe
 
02:53:50.469 --> 02:53:50.479 align:start position:0%
we don't need the government do
 
02:53:50.479 --> 02:53:52.229 align:start position:0%
we don't need the government do
everything

02:53:52.229 --> 02:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:53:55.349 --> 02:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
Jers anything else represented
 
02:53:58.830 --> 02:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
fellows um I just wanted to say that
 
02:54:01.950 --> 02:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
with respect to Grants this we could
 
02:54:06.349 --> 02:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
create this uh fund but we're limiting
 
02:54:08.309 --> 02:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
where the money could come from because
 
02:54:10.269 --> 02:54:10.279 align:start position:0%
the federal government would
 
02:54:13.790 --> 02:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
never um support money for these some of
 
02:54:16.150 --> 02:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
these it items they would support it for
 
02:54:19.950 --> 02:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
like hiring new new people but not for
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
putting money into a retirement plan
 
02:54:26.309 --> 02:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
into a tax advantage savings account and
 
02:54:28.750 --> 02:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
when it comes to things like uh tuition
 
02:54:31.910 --> 02:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
or train training would be great tra to
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
but you in a Federal grant you'd be more
 
02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
likely to have a contract with um snhu
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
or something like that to develop a
 
02:54:47.229 --> 02:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
program and make get affordable at low
 
02:54:52.269 --> 02:54:52.279 align:start position:0%
cost or no cost to recruits so this
 
02:54:55.030 --> 02:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
just and I don't think the federal
 
02:54:57.790 --> 02:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
government would um approve something
 
02:55:01.030 --> 02:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
with another entity managing the program
 
02:55:04.750 --> 02:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
instead of the agency at HHS managing
 
02:55:07.870 --> 02:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
the program because they pay um for
 
02:55:09.870 --> 02:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
administrative cost usually with a
 
02:55:13.269 --> 02:55:13.279 align:start position:0%
percentage so this is really written for
 
02:55:14.950 --> 02:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
some kind of
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
specific plan that somebody has in their
 
02:55:20.790 --> 02:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
mind that we haven't really seen and
 
02:55:22.670 --> 02:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
don't understand that we could fund it
 
02:55:24.510 --> 02:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
with State money but I think other
 
02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
sources would not fit into this so if
 
02:55:30.510 --> 02:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding you correctly you are
 
02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
are you agreeing with representative
 
02:55:34.269 --> 02:55:34.279 align:start position:0%
spillsbury to some extent that there's
 
02:55:35.790 --> 02:55:35.800 align:start position:0%
too many things just listed here that
 
02:55:38.710 --> 02:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.469 --> 02:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
defined I'm I'm my concern is that there
 
02:55:44.990 --> 02:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
are too many things list did that make
 
02:55:48.110 --> 02:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
it restrictive so that it wouldn't
 
02:55:52.030 --> 02:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
qualify for some sources of Grants okay
 
02:55:55.389 --> 02:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative shamber thank
 
02:55:57.750 --> 02:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I disagree with my
 
02:56:00.590 --> 02:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
fellow representative here that you're
 
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
taking the assumption that grants are
 
02:56:04.990 --> 02:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
only Federal there are nonprofit grants
 
02:56:07.710 --> 02:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
there are private individual grants that
 
02:56:11.469 --> 02:56:11.479 align:start position:0%
can be uh uh uh come into for an
 
02:56:14.590 --> 02:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
organization there are uh even state
 
02:56:17.790 --> 02:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
grants that can apply to this I don't
 
02:56:20.229 --> 02:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
think we should look at it as Federal
 
02:56:22.590 --> 02:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
that that this
 
02:56:24.910 --> 02:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
money comes sometimes with strings
 
02:56:26.030 --> 02:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
attached but that's up to the
 
02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
organization to decide if they want to
 
02:56:30.830 --> 02:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
accept that Grant I I just disagree with
 
02:56:33.550 --> 02:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
your your point of it's all
 
02:56:37.950 --> 02:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
federal representative Aly thank you um
 
02:56:39.630 --> 02:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
as I said
 
02:56:43.870 --> 02:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
before this was written with the
 
02:56:47.429 --> 02:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
understand standing with the Senate
 
02:56:50.110 --> 02:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
that the first year they were going to
 
02:56:55.590 --> 02:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
dump 15 million into a section of HHS
 
02:56:58.190 --> 02:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
which didn't really know how to handle
 
02:57:01.309 --> 02:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
it it sounds like um it's taken them
 
02:57:02.830 --> 02:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
quite a while to write the
 
02:57:09.150 --> 02:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
rules um and that the next year they
 
02:57:15.349 --> 02:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
would get it out to a designated ENT
 
02:57:19.150 --> 02:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
to take care of and they put it together
 
02:57:24.630 --> 02:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
as what a lot of people in child care
 
02:57:27.110 --> 02:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
said would be
 
02:57:32.110 --> 02:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
helpful in their businesses to be able
 
02:57:34.630 --> 02:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
to keep or
 
02:57:39.070 --> 02:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
recruit on more workers they they lose
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
workers with great regularity now and
 
02:57:44.830 --> 02:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
they have to close down units because of
 
02:57:49.510 --> 02:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
it um because of that $5 difference but
 
02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of the people that go into this
 
02:57:55.990 --> 02:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
profession want to stay in it and they
 
02:57:59.790 --> 02:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
um they do they are as women always have
 
02:58:02.910 --> 02:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
been and some men as well volun and as
 
02:58:04.510 --> 02:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:58:07.710 --> 02:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
volunteers in that are stretching their
 
02:58:10.429 --> 02:58:10.439 align:start position:0%
budgets to be able to afford to
 
02:58:14.670 --> 02:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
stay and this would these are things
 
02:58:18.030 --> 02:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
that would help them to do that there it
 
02:58:21.110 --> 02:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
isn't complete specification the rules
 
02:58:24.830 --> 02:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be written next year but
 
02:58:28.870 --> 02:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
the idea was that there would be Rules
 
02:58:32.990 --> 02:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
by the time we got around to the 2025
 
02:58:37.710 --> 02:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
Budget on and that would specify
 
02:58:41.630 --> 02:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
everything and that the Senate would
 
02:58:45.269 --> 02:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
again come back and say say we need to
 
02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
put some money into child care and we
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
think it should be the same amount
 
02:58:54.110 --> 02:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
that's what they said last year um but
 
02:58:56.070 --> 02:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
presumably at that point it would be
 
02:58:59.030 --> 02:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
more efficiently used than probably will
 
02:59:04.550 --> 02:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
happen this year so um
 
02:59:07.469 --> 02:59:07.479 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about which I didn't
 
02:59:09.150 --> 02:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
understand before I talked with Mary
 
02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
Jane walner about it but um
 
02:59:19.910 --> 02:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
you've got to remember we became
 
02:59:22.269 --> 02:59:22.279 align:start position:0%
a a
 
02:59:27.550 --> 02:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
um two twers per two worker per Family
 
02:59:31.670 --> 02:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
household system in this country and
 
02:59:34.910 --> 02:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
then the pandemic destroyed
 
02:59:40.830 --> 02:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
that and we have to if in order to get
 
02:59:44.070 --> 02:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
back to it we've got to have more more
 
02:59:47.349 --> 02:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
child care for the twers families
 
02:59:50.110 --> 02:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
especially the twers families that can't
 
02:59:56.389 --> 02:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
afford to pay $5 more on that are
 
02:59:58.670 --> 02:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
working in our we're working in our
 
03:00:00.630 --> 03:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
businesses in our businesses are now
 
03:00:01.710 --> 03:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
even though we've got a lot of
 
03:00:03.349 --> 03:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
immigrants who have come in and have
 
03:00:06.550 --> 03:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
helped to create the surge that we've
 
03:00:09.349 --> 03:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
got in employment now it apparently
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
isn't anywhere near
 
03:00:14.269 --> 03:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
enough so
 
03:00:19.229 --> 03:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
this this is a major economic drag on
 
03:00:22.710 --> 03:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
our on our society because we no longer
 
03:00:25.469 --> 03:00:25.479 align:start position:0%
are a one worker
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
family but we're acting like we have to
 
03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
act like one right now because we don't
 
03:00:30.640 --> 03:00:31.750 align:start position:0%
act like one right now because we don't
have

03:00:31.750 --> 03:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:00:34.990 --> 03:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
Alternatives this would right loosen the
 
03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
Alternatives yeah we know
 
03:00:40.229 --> 03:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
um we've kind of acknowledged there
 
03:00:42.750 --> 03:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
there's an issue it's a policy issue
 
03:00:44.110 --> 03:00:44.120 align:start position:0%
that got to this point where were
 
03:00:49.309 --> 03:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
focused on the the revenue aspect um I
 
03:00:53.150 --> 03:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
think um are we all set discussing this
 
03:00:55.910 --> 03:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
this point okay I'll close the work
 
03:00:57.389 --> 03:00:57.399 align:start position:0%
session on
 
03:01:02.870 --> 03:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
1611 what are we so um the exec session
 
03:01:04.229 --> 03:01:04.239 align:start position:0%

04:09:49.630 --> 04:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
um Statewide education property tax and
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%

04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
move itl on this
 
04:10:03.510 --> 04:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
bill all right do I have a
 
04:10:06.030 --> 04:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
second second from
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
Southworth I know see him down there no
 
04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
I I have trouble seeing him as well um
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your your
 
04:10:17.550 --> 04:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
motion yes uh first of all I got a
 
04:10:21.030 --> 04:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons to itl this first one
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
is that it's the education property tax
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
i s to push that all off a while till
 
04:10:28.030 --> 04:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
till we have a a committee look at the
 
04:10:29.790 --> 04:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
whole thing and see what the courts uh
 
04:10:33.189 --> 04:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
do but this this we heard in testimony
 
04:10:36.349 --> 04:10:36.359 align:start position:0%
that uh this was excess of 6.6 million I
 
04:10:38.590 --> 04:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
think would come back uh is a a credit
 
04:10:40.550 --> 04:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
never hit that high I think the highest
 
04:10:42.910 --> 04:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's hit is 5.6 and it's not growing
 
04:10:46.269 --> 04:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
that fast actually 5.38 5.38 it's moot
 
04:10:48.670 --> 04:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
in other words yeah that's another
 
04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
powerful word
 
04:10:53.950 --> 04:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
moot okay any other
 
04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%

study do I have a
 
04:14:40.149 --> 04:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
Aly and would you like to speak to your
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
motion very brief comments I mean we we
 
04:14:47.469 --> 04:14:47.479 align:start position:0%
heard that there are big differences
 
04:14:49.269 --> 04:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
between one Dam and another Dam one
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
Town's appetite another Town's appetite
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
Downstream uh possibly there's room for
 
04:14:57.070 --> 04:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
amending this in a narrower way we know
 
04:14:59.469 --> 04:14:59.479 align:start position:0%
that the state now can offer a dam but I
 
04:15:01.790 --> 04:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
think that uh certain towns are looking
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
for a financing mechanism so we can give
 
04:15:06.070 --> 04:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
this some more space to shape it and see
 
04:15:09.269 --> 04:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
it come back next year in a budget
 
04:15:13.149 --> 04:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
year thank you any other comments seeing
 
04:15:16.429 --> 04:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
none the clerk oh yes I will just say
 
04:15:19.189 --> 04:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
I'm passionately for this bill I heard a
 
04:15:21.950 --> 04:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion that was policy when
 
04:15:23.990 --> 04:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
it was really just this committee's role
 
04:15:26.710 --> 04:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
was finance and so I'm I'm not going to
 
04:15:31.109 --> 04:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of the uh interim study
 
04:15:33.790 --> 04:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
okay despite that the clerk will call
 
04:15:37.510 --> 04:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
the role absolutely two different roles

motion it
 
04:17:11.710 --> 04:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
second second second by representative
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
ducet would you like to speak to your
 
04:17:19.389 --> 04:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you Mr chair uh
 
04:17:22.830 --> 04:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
currently we have a housing study in
 
04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
progress uh possibly more than one from
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony we've heard I see no need
 
04:17:33.550 --> 04:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
in duplicating that effort and um I
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
guess that's enough thank you okay other
 
04:17:44.189 --> 04:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:47.309 --> 04:17:47.319 align:start position:0%
Aly I think we said it in the work
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
session um this is looking at a
 
04:17:52.590 --> 04:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
particular issue that is not being
 
04:17:55.630 --> 04:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
covered at this time and probably won't
 
04:17:58.870 --> 04:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
be covered for quite some time to come
 
04:18:01.630 --> 04:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
but since it takes a long time to figure
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
out the zoning by the special housing
 
04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:09.030 align:start position:0%
out the zoning by the special housing
committee

04:18:09.030 --> 04:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
so we think that a
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
short focused study of just this one
 
04:18:18.309 --> 04:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
issue could come back again to the
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
special housing
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
committee for them to fit into their
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
General work if necessary but that it it
 
04:18:31.149 --> 04:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
should provide on more Enlightenment on
 
04:18:35.109 --> 04:18:35.119 align:start position:0%
the issue that is very important for the
 
04:18:38.349 --> 04:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
uh lower income parts and the middle
 
04:18:41.670 --> 04:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
inome parts of our Workforce that
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
frequently in housing issues get um the
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
short shift frankly in terms of of
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
building because construction is a lot
 
04:18:56.830 --> 04:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
more lucrative to build for the higher
 
04:18:56.840 --> 04:19:00.510 align:start position:0%
more lucrative to build for the higher
income

04:19:00.510 --> 04:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.520 --> 04:19:02.109 align:start position:0%

shamber

04:21:37.389 --> 04:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
shamber
 
04:21:40.590 --> 04:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
yes and I think I spoke to the motion
 
04:21:43.189 --> 04:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
just now
 
04:21:47.109 --> 04:21:47.119 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know if any other represent
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:54.990 --> 04:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
leapley um I reviewed the statutory and
 
04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
study committees that are
 
04:22:00.389 --> 04:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
currently exist existing and it doesn't
 
04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
look like there's one that is dealing
 
04:22:05.309 --> 04:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
with low income and Workforce housing um
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
and this does not
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
have an impact um fiscally and I think
 
04:22:14.550 --> 04:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
everyone in New Hampshire acknowledges
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
that housing is a crisis so it seems to
 
04:22:18.590 --> 04:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
me a study would be appropriate at this
 
04:22:23.189 --> 04:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:26.950 --> 04:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
you okay representative ducet just just
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
for the record I think we discussed in
 
04:22:30.550 --> 04:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
the work session that we have a special
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
committee on housing and that's what was
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
referenced not a specific study
 
04:22:35.359 --> 04:22:41.950 align:start position:0%
referenced not a specific study
committee

04:22:41.950 --> 04:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
