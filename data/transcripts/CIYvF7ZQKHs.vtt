00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
and see if the marriage had been
 
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh recorded
 
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
and and just make that change based on
 
00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
the information received in the portal
 
00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
but if someone wanted to register to
 
00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:13.830 align:start position:0%
but if someone wanted to register to
vote

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
this would still require them to go
 
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
through the the process of filling out
 
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
at least an online application and then
 
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
processing the information through the
 
00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist who would
 
00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
check our four things identity
 
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
citizenship domicile and
 
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
we'll go from from there
 
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
the third part is relative to recount
 
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.510 align:start position:0%
the third part is relative to recount
fees

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
um many in the states don't have a
 
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
recount fee
 
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh for a certain uh percentage
 
00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh the different candidates this would
 
00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
institute that
 
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
at a quarter of a percent so that uh a
 
00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
candidate that was uh very close
 
00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh within a uh i believe a quarter of a
 
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
percent is what i put in the bill
 
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
but then it does um go in for those
 
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.950 align:start position:0%
but then it does um go in for those
between

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
that quarter of a percent and three
 
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.870 align:start position:0%
that quarter of a percent and three
percent

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
and raises the fees uh they are still
 
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
very very reasonable um for what is
 
00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 align:start position:0%
uh required there is a big jump in the
 
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
statute right now
 
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
when you get to three percent which uh
 
00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
requires that you pay the full cost of
 
00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
the recount
 
00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
um and this kind of short you know
 
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
narrows that gap between the two percent
 
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
and the three percent
 
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh but still like i say
 
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
they are still very very reasonable
 
00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh part number four itemized statements
 
00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:50.469 align:start position:0%
uh part number four itemized statements
still

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh filed by political candidates and
 
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.990 align:start position:0%
uh filed by political candidates and
parties

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
i know you've got legislation that you
 
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
pass through that
 
00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
that changes part of the statute but
 
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
not this particular section right now
 
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem comes when a
 
00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.749 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem comes when a
candidate

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
uses a facsimile machine to send in
 
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
their financials is that depending upon
 
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
the quality that they choose in the
 
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
facts only machine
 
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
and other that when they send in these
 
00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 align:start position:0%
financial statements
 
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
they are often unreadable
 
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
so this puts the
 
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
requirement that the candidate is
 
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
responsible to make sure
 
00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
that that information is legible
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
and that if the secretary of state's
 
00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
office finds that it is not legible
 
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
for the candidate to refile that
 
00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 align:start position:0%
information and provide that legible
 
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.990 align:start position:0%
information and provide that legible
copy

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
i can expand on that if somebody has
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
questions later
 
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
the fifth part is actually not a part
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
that i sponsored but
 
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
one of the other senators and it has to
 
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
do with
 
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh locations that aren't operating
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
on a yearly calendar but
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
fiscal calendar that starts possibly in
 
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
in july the 1st and
 
00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
allows them to continue to spend if
 
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
their meeting
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
is not held by july the 1st
 
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
so that they have the same advantages
 
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.470 align:start position:0%
so that they have the same advantages
that

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
the communities that have uh their
 
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
year starting in january the first
 
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
as all of you know you represent the
 
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.110 align:start position:0%
as all of you know you represent the
counties

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 align:start position:0%
and there is either tax and
 
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
participation notes
 
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
but they are still allowed the various
 
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
towns are allowed to spend money
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
based on the rules between that period
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
of january the first and when the
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
the budget is approved at town meetings
 
00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
or even at the county level that
 
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
at the county which this uh doesn't uh
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
really address
 
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm happy to answer any question
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
that you've got
 
00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start position:0%
i tried to make it short enough that i
 
00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.749 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
members

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
senator gray i want us to the last part
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
the last section in regards to the
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal years
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
first question i guessed that the intent
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
was to deal with
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
approved budgets that dealt with more
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
than one
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
calendar year right the fiscal year goes
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
to two years rather than the prior year
 
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.189 align:start position:0%
to two years rather than the prior year
correct

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
again i i'm going to speak from what
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
i understood uh senator khan to uh
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh his intent on this but
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
in durham coven what we did is we passed
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
the towns could move their town meeting
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh to a different time
 
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
and if uh right now in the law the only
 
00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
ones that can
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
use uh the spending provisions uh that
 
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
are in the law right now
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
to spend money between the start of the
 
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal the start of the calendar year
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
and their town meeting
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
um are towns that that operate that way
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
but if a town has a july first start
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
and they moved their town meeting into
 
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.550 align:start position:0%
and they moved their town meeting into
july

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
july
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
which would have been authorized by the
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
then there was a problem with them
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
spending money
 
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
between july 1st and the authorization
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
of their town meeting
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
and this legislation uh
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
would give them that opportunity uh
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
should their town meeting for any reason
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
be delayed
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
and still retain uh the provisions that
 
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.550 align:start position:0%
and still retain uh the provisions that
the

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
normal towns that have a calendar your
 
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.950 align:start position:0%
normal towns that have a calendar your
budget

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
would be thank you senator i i did
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
understand that i guess i should have
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
been more specific my question relates
 
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.230 align:start position:0%
been more specific my question relates
to

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
line five
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to the change from prior
 
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.550 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to the change from prior
years

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
to prior multiple years and so my
 
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.350 align:start position:0%
to prior multiple years and so my
question

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
is if indeed what we're talking about
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
is a fiscal year isn't that what it
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
should say
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
because arguably prior years
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
if i and maybe there's somebody there
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
who's a better english person than
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
i am but it seems to me that that
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
creates a plural
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh choice of previous years
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
um again the intent of okay
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
senator khan you'd have to speak to him
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
the the way i understand this is
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
the immediately prior year based on that
 
00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.430 align:start position:0%
the immediately prior year based on that
budget

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
and because the ones that start on july
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
1st have two calendar years i suspect
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's why it was made plural
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
however i think it creates another
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
that that is has been pointed out to me
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to raise it uh and
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
care as as i often point out to people i
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
are an engineer
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're gonna have the numbers
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
not with the letters and the in the uh
 
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:38.950 align:start position:0%
not with the letters and the in the uh
grammar

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
grammar
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
so i'll defer to anyone else
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
all right um let's go through this
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee i
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
sort of can't believe we don't have any
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions here let's go through it
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
um by section part one
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'm dealing with the disqualification of
 
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.350 align:start position:0%
i'm dealing with the disqualification of
certain

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
persons in regards to being behind the
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
guardrail and ballots
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
i have a quick question madam chair all
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
right representative terozian and lob go
 
00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:15.990 align:start position:0%
right representative terozian and lob go
ahead

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh senator great for
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify and it looks pretty
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
straightforward this only affects
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
say the town moderator or any other
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
election official who's on the ballot
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
for that particular election to be there
 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
in the area of commonwealth so it
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't preclude them from being there
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
during the process of people coming in
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
right there are many duties which need
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
to be performed
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
at the close of the election the
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
prohibition against
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
them touching a voted ballot
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
is still there that they will not be
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
involved in the counting
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
of their race but as many of you know
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
the verification of the checklist is
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
another thing that has to happen
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh there's other duties uh just cleaning
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
up the polling place remember we've got
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
all those postings inside the
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh voting boats that need to be cleaned
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
up the pencils the
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know in some communities they
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
actually uh disassemble the voting
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
booths and things to get
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
the room ready for a function that may
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
happen the next day
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
so uh again there's there's all kinds of
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
other things in the moderator
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
or the moderator's designee can
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
assign them to other duties
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
remember that in a lot of these
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
locations up north
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult to get enough
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
people to work the election
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
and especially qualified people and
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
i believe that this was passed in the
 
00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
i believe that this was passed in the
past

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
but because of legislative process
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
the the two statues have diverged a
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
this brings them back in line with each
 
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.990 align:start position:0%
this brings them back in line with each
other

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you but
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
senator gray i have a question 658
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
following up on what you said
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
a 658-24 is a disqualification
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
as to handling the ballot
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
section 2 659-58 would appear
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
to be much broader in that
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
which would be we're adding a moderator
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
um or any election official
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
cannot be in the area designated for the
 
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
handling of marked ballots so that's
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
significantly broader than
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
not touching so in
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
for and i've got to relate to my
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
community because that's what i know
 
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.470 align:start position:0%
community because that's what i know
best

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh we have used a gymnasium
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
and everything occurs
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
in that one large area uh
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
the guard rail is set up and but once
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
you go to stand to take your ballot the
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
tables are there for you to mark the
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
ballot the booze
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballots are being processed
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
the food table the all-important food
 
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.630 align:start position:0%
the food table the all-important food
table

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
is behind that guardrail at the end of
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
the room
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
and then the ballot counting devices are
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of the room
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
so if i restrict the moderator
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
who or election official from being
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
is it i could have a moderator so the
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
idea is i have a moderator on the ballot
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
but they're on
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
for a different office they're it's not
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
an election official
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
so now they can't be in my community
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
pretty much anywhere near anything
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
i have an elected moderator who can't
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
essentially do what he's been elected to
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
do right
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
well this would change that this would
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
say that they can be within
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
those guard rails and that's part of the
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
658-24 as it is now enacted and 659.58
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
as it is now enacted is that those two
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
statutes don't agree about whether the
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
person can be
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
in the area not in the area this
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
would combine those two statutes
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
together and say yes
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
you can be within the guard rails but
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
you can't be
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know any place right you know right
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
next to where they're
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
they're counting the votes or be
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
involved in the counting of the votes
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
and you could perform other duties
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
within that area
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
so like in your community when they are
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
counting the checklist to see how many
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
new voters how many
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
changes to republicans or democrats and
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
changes back
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
during the primaries all of those
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
functions have to be performed by
 
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.389 align:start position:0%
functions have to be performed by
somebody

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
and an election official who was on the
 
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.430 align:start position:0%
and an election official who was on the
ballot

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
not only for their elected position but
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
for some other position
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
could be in the area performing those
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
other duties
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
um you know so yes they would be able to
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
further questions hands anybody in lob
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you thank
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
this somewhat follows up on
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
representative griffin's line of
 
00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.110 align:start position:0%
representative griffin's line of
questioning

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
questioning
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire constitution says that
 
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.470 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire constitution says that
the

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
moderator uh in the presence of
 
00:13:58.959 --> 00:14:00.069 align:start position:0%
moderator uh in the presence of
selectmen

00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
shall sort and count the said votes and
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
make a
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
public declaration thereof and this
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
statute seems to be saying well no you
 
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.310 align:start position:0%
statute seems to be saying well no you
can't

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
do you see a conflict in that is this
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
law in conflict with our constitution
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
uh i don't believe so uh i'm
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
normally the secretary of state is on
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
these and i don't know whether he's
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
signed up
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
as a speaker or not uh but um
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
there will be a uh
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
the moderator's designee or an assistant
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
moderator or whatever you want to call
 
00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:39.350 align:start position:0%
moderator or whatever you want to call
them

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh who would be uh taking care of those
 
00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:42.710 align:start position:0%
uh who would be uh taking care of those
uh

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
functions of sorting a lot of times
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
when we talk about things like that we
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
may say the moderator but we also mean
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
the moderator's designee
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
and i believe that through all those
 
00:14:57.199 --> 00:14:58.710 align:start position:0%
and i believe that through all those
things

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
that we would meet the constitutional
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
test um
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to defer to the
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
on that you know
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
i i don't have a problem with the uh the
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
moderator announcing the results because
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
those are also certified by the
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh town clerk or the award clerk
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
um and the uh selectmen
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
um but again as to touching those
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
voted ballots um that would not be
 
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.470 align:start position:0%
voted ballots um that would not be
appropriate

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
and i believe that it would be covered
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
the constitutional part of it would be
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
covered by the moderator
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh selecting a designee to do those
 
00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:45.670 align:start position:0%
uh selecting a designee to do those
functions

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
functions
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
deputies scanlan is on as an attendee
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'll ask to hear from him after we
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
finish going through the sections for
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions for committee
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
members at this point on
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any hands i'm gonna move
 
00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:04.949 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any hands i'm gonna move
on

00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%

part two we take questions on that
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry i thought i said i oh i
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative terezian
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
thank you uh found chairman thank you
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
again senator
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
is there a fiscal note or any uh idea
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
what it would cost to set
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
up this uh information portal
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i have a follow-up question after
 
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.150 align:start position:0%
and i have a follow-up question after
that

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
sure there is no fiscal note on this
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
again the secretary of state may be able
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
to give you
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
additional information we have various
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
portals in the state of new hampshire
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
being able to accept uh an
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
information uh it may be just a uh
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
an email that somebody sends uh you know
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
set up the portal
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
saying hey if you want to change to
 
00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:14.470 align:start position:0%
saying hey if you want to change to
election

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know your registration or
 
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.510 align:start position:0%
uh you know your registration or
whatever

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
and it send an email to the appropriate
 
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.270 align:start position:0%
and it send an email to the appropriate
person

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
um so again whether or not
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
secretary of state filled out the form
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
and said that's the system that i'm
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
which would be in compliance with this
 
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.470 align:start position:0%
which would be in compliance with this
legislation

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
but it can be very simple
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you my follow-up senator
 
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:42.870 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you my follow-up senator
is

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
um so you envision this
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
this is being a state-run portal uh
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
looks like being run by the secretary of
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
state's office
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
and would this be a standardized um
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know portal similar to the dmv that
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
tom clark's
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
access where it would be standard
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
basically standardized for all
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
time i see it being run by
 
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
doit but that doesn't necessarily mean
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
that that's what would happen
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
there are various portals that we have
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
out there right now
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that this would be an another one
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
added to
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
a bigger statewide portal that would
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
have if you want
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know a statement that says if you
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
want to change any of your voter
 
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.710 align:start position:0%
want to change any of your voter
registration

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
or register to vote you know here's
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
where you start you click on it
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh put in your name and some basic
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
information what you want to change
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
i hit the send button and that email
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state to send out to
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
the appropriate
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
town clerk and again i don't see that
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
a large cost impact on the state
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
because we've already got similar things
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
set up
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
um but again i would defer to the
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
on how they answered the question when
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
they were asked if there was a physical
 
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.789 align:start position:0%
they were asked if there was a physical
impact

00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
on section part two
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
looking for hands uh senator gray i have
 
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:22.830 align:start position:0%
looking for hands uh senator gray i have
won

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
won
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
this section
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
is not a study committee
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
or a study with a report as to what to
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
be implemented
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
this actually says you're going to do it
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
if this act takes effect 60 days
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
at a minimum the end of june beginning
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
in july
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
because we're not having session i don't
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
think till june so let's say the end of
 
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.990 align:start position:0%
think till june so let's say the end of
june

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
june
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking effective 60 days after
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
its passage
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
earliest possible date august
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
this being implemented when because you
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
have this
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
reference for until january 1st 2022.
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
and i asked this question because
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
i happen to recall that there's a big
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
push on
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
an audit going on for the secretary of
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
state this
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
summer i recall that they're looking at
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices they know that's
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm sort of um
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
curious as to what you think the
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
timeline is and how
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
the office would handle it or would you
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
just prefer to
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
defer to the secretary of state's office
 
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.190 align:start position:0%
defer to the secretary of state's office
well

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh certainly the secretary of state
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
would add the final word
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
but the way i envisioned this the
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
it would be doit that would have the
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
bulk of the
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
effort here and they would be the ones
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the portal is in
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
aligned with others for security and for
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
the information provided
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh for you know doing the other things
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
they are currently
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
in charge of various portals out there
 
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:19.909 align:start position:0%
in charge of various portals out there
uh

00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
and for those things and so for the
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
secretary of state just
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
to to get with them and say these are
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
the kind of
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
things that i would like on that
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
i think is a minimal intrusion on
 
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.230 align:start position:0%
i think is a minimal intrusion on
secretary's

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
secretary's
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
efforts if your committee decides that
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
you want to push one of those dates out
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
certainly we can talk about that in the
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
or if the committee in the senate
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
wants to accept it um i don't see that
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
it would be a big problem one way or the
 
00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:53.750 align:start position:0%
it would be a big problem one way or the
other

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative prudhommer
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:03.750 align:start position:0%
thank you representative prudhommer
brian

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative prudhommer brian we're
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
we've had that problem before i think it
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
has to do with the angle of whatever
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
do you have a volume on your computer or
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
device that might be turned right
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
way low
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go to representative grow
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll come back to you
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative prude homer brian
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
senator gray for taking my question
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
senator gray would all of the proof of
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
identity and proof of
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh residency requirements that we
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
that we have in the law would that still
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
be in place will
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
will this portal in any way affect those
 
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.830 align:start position:0%
will this portal in any way affect those
things

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
no it won't because what you're doing is
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
just starting the process for
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
voter registration or absentee ballot
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
those forms
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
as the rest of the state law stays
 
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.270 align:start position:0%
as the rest of the state law stays
intact

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
intact
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
it does not allow you to register it
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
allows you to request to be registered
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
and request to have an absentee ballot
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
and request to have your
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
your name party or whatever else uh
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
is and it would be up to the election
 
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.070 align:start position:0%
is and it would be up to the election
officials

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
officials
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
still in state law as it is right now to
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
complete those
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%

okay part three was recounts
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
i didn't see anything on that part four
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
had to do with the format
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
of statements being filed any questions
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%

i did have a question uh on on part
 
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.909 align:start position:0%
i did have a question uh on on part
three

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
um senator gray
 
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh do you know how long the existing
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh recount fees have been in place and
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
what the cost of living increase has
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
been since
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
the current fees were enacted uh
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
no i don't um i can
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
see if i can quickly look up the statute
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
and tell you what it says at the bottom
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
for for when it was
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
um if you you have to bear with me
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
for me to do that though well we the
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee might be witnessing
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
a miracle senator gray thinks he's going
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
to find a statute that's
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
only got one date associated with it and
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
hasn't been mucked around with the led
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
by the legislature since its enactment
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
so let's see
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
660 uh cone two is what i'm looking for
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm on my way
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'm hitting the browse button
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
i'm going way down to the bottom
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
and 660
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the last time that
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
that statute was
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh amended was in 2008
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
and that uh before that um
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
before 2008 it was 1995
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
as long as there's more than one date it
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
means you can't tell anything
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
all right okay thank you all right so
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to wait for that
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
miracle to occur on another day
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
right cordell johnston
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire municipal association
 
00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:20.789 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire municipal association
has

00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair and committee
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
members cordell johnston representing
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking only on part five
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
if that's okay and uh we do support part
 
00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.470 align:start position:0%
if that's okay and uh we do support part
five

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh i think senator gray explained that
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
very well
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh but just briefly um as i think you
 
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.029 align:start position:0%
uh but just briefly um as i think you
know

00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
most towns have their town meeting in
 
00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:52.789 align:start position:0%
most towns have their town meeting in
march

00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
and that's when they adopt their budget
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
and approve expenditures
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
but they they have a fiscal year that
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
runs on it on a calendar
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
calendar year basis so by the time they
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
actually adopt their budget
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
they're already two and a half months
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
into their fiscal year
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
so rsa 3213 authorizes them to spend
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
money during that first two and a half
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
months before they adopt the budget
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
to to make expenditures that are
 
00:28:26.159 --> 00:28:27.350 align:start position:0%
to to make expenditures that are
reasonable

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh compared to prior years
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
and as senator gray mentioned there are
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
some towns
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
that have a that have adopted
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
any town can do this but a small number
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
have done it have adopted a
 
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
june 30 fiscal year and if you have a
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
june 30 fiscal year
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
you can either have your town meeting in
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
march or have it in may
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
but in either in either case you're now
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
adopting your budget before your fiscal
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
year begins
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
so you don't so you don't need the
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh the benefit of rsa 3213
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
unless you find you find yourself in a
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
situation like what happened last year
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
when you have to postpone your meeting
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
as a number of towns did had to postpone
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
their meetings until
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
after june 30th and rsa 3213
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
did not apply to them so we had to get
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
the governor to issue an emergency order
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
which he did
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
that authorized those towns with the
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
with june 30 fiscal year to
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
get the benefit of rsa 3213. so this
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
part 5 would simply put that in place
 
00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:43.350 align:start position:0%
part 5 would simply put that in place
permanently

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
permanently
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the event that there there's a
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
situation like that again
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
where those towns have to postpone their
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
meetings until
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
after june 30th so that's that's the
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of that
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
um madam chair you you raised a question
 
00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.549 align:start position:0%
um madam chair you you raised a question
about

00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
the about the apostrophe uh
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
in line five and um
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
that was a good question and it really
 
00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:09.350 align:start position:0%
that was a good question and it really
is

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's a matter of uh correct
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
english uh the problem with the existing
 
00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:16.789 align:start position:0%
english uh the problem with the existing
law

00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
is it says prior year apostrophe
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
s so if you're intending to refer to
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
just last year it should say
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
the prior years but it doesn't have the
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
word v
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
in there and so you're left
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
it it's unclear whether whether the
 
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
it it's unclear whether whether the
statute

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
intends to refer to just the the last
 
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.870 align:start position:0%
intends to refer to just the the last
year

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
or intends to refer to all prior years
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure the answer i'm not sure
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
it matters that much but it
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
ought to be clear one way or the other
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
so it either should say
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
the prior year apostrophe s
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
or it should say prior years
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
apostrophe and this bill changes it to
 
00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.070 align:start position:0%
apostrophe and this bill changes it to
say

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
prior year's apostrophe and
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
i do think that that's probably the
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
better answer
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
because if you're just comparing it to
 
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:17.990 align:start position:0%
because if you're just comparing it to
last

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
year last year could have been an
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
unusual year
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
so for example if you look at a town's
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the town had probably four
 
00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:32.310 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the town had probably four
elections

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
state pri presidential primary town
 
00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:35.430 align:start position:0%
state pri presidential primary town
election

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
state primary state general election
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
in 2021 they only have one election the
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
town election
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
so your it i think it makes sense
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
that your election budget ought to be
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
or what you're spending on elections
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
ought to be based on
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
um sort of an average of some number of
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
prior years budgets rather than just on
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
last year's budget otherwise you could
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
be spending a lot more
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
if you had an unusual amount of
 
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.350 align:start position:0%
if you had an unusual amount of
expenditures

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
last year so sorry to
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
sorry to go into such detail on that but
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh but the point is that the language in
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
on line five ought to be
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
cleaned up one way or the other it
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
should say
 
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
either the prior year apostrophe s or it
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
should say
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
prior year's apostrophe
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
so you indicated you actually took a
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
position in part five does the
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
missile association take a position on
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
any other parts of this uh
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
legislation uh no no
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
well i do think that uh part one is a
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
useful clarification
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
um but uh other than that no we don't
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
have a position on anything else
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
all right i'm seeing nothing thank you
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
very much also
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%

are if you could raise your hand that
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
would be terrific

and we will listen to your comments
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh and just uh you know there were some
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
questions that were posed uh earlier
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
in the testimony i thought i would just
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
address those uh
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
as best i can i believe represent
 
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.149 align:start position:0%
as best i can i believe represent
bergeron

00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
bergeron
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
raises an interesting point with the
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional mention
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
of uh the role of moderators uh in the
 
00:34:25.599 --> 00:34:27.109 align:start position:0%
of uh the role of moderators uh in the
constitution

00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know i don't know that i'm
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
qualified to answer
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
you know giving a constitutional legal
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
opinion on exactly what that means
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's probably a good question to pose to
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
but what i can tell you is that this
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
provision in the statute has moved
 
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.069 align:start position:0%
provision in the statute has moved
around

00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
over time uh you know relaxing the role
 
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:47.990 align:start position:0%
over time uh you know relaxing the role
of

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh the moderator being able to process
 
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.829 align:start position:0%
uh the moderator being able to process
uh

00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
ballots that have been marked
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
by voters um and has tightened it up
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
so you know that part of it seems to be
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
the priority of
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
the legislature based on the you know
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
the feeling at the time
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
um and i'll just say this personally i'm
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
not speaking
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the office but but i
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
the moderator is elected by
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
the people uh in the town or city ward
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
to do a job you know based on their
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
integrity and credibility
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
and they should be permitted to do that
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
job it's for a fairly short
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
you know if as long as they handle their
 
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.750 align:start position:0%
you know if as long as they handle their
job

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
in a very objective professional way
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
it probably doesn't matter that they
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
might be running for some other
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
position on the ballot you know the same
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
is true with a town clerk
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
their supervisors have a checklist i
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
know that the legislature
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
is full of representatives who are also
 
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.870 align:start position:0%
is full of representatives who are also
moderators

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
moderators
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
and the ones that come quickly to mind
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
are representative lying
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative dan eaton uh represent
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
howard pearl representative bob harb
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
and and i'm sure that's probably just uh
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
the tip of the iceberg so you may want
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
you know you may want to ask them for
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
their input on this
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
item as well you know i know there are a
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
number of uh supervisors of
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
the checklist um i believe
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative ward is one
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
and uh you know so i i think those
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
individuals may have some
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
important insight in helping you
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
decide that topic moving on to
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
part two the question was asked
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
is there a fiscal note uh to
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
creating an election information portal
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh the answer to that is yes uh we
 
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:47.990 align:start position:0%
uh the answer to that is yes uh we
haven't

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
figured it out yet uh what that would be
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
because um it really depends on the
 
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.950 align:start position:0%
because um it really depends on the
design

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
um i'll start off by saying that that i
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
agree with the principles that
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
senator gray has put together in the
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
creation of an election information
 
00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.310 align:start position:0%
creation of an election information
portal

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
portal
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
it may sound like a simple thing to do
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
i.t projects usually end up
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
not being completed on time and i think
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
uh implementation dates that are in here
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
are too ambitious
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
i think it would be more reasonable to
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
shoot for something for the 2024
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
election cycle and i say that because
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
not only
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
would we have to design and develop
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
the portal but we would also have to
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
come up with the procedures
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
on how the portal would interact with
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
local election officials whether it's
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
or the supervisors of the checklist to
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
the standards and the practices that are
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
being used are uniform
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
and and they're properly trained and
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
that would be a very important part
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
of this process we also do have some
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
other important
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
i.t projects that are underway that
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
that have a priority one of them is
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
moving forward with electronic poll
 
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.790 align:start position:0%
moving forward with electronic poll
books

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
books
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
in a way that the towns can benefit from
 
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.710 align:start position:0%
in a way that the towns can benefit from
them

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh we all know that the optical scan
 
00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:21.990 align:start position:0%
uh we all know that the optical scan
accuvote

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
accuvote
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
devices are really
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
rapidly approaching end of life and so
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
actually looking for an alternative to
 
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.790 align:start position:0%
actually looking for an alternative to
that

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
with rfps being issued and things like
 
00:38:35.839 --> 00:38:38.310 align:start position:0%
with rfps being issued and things like
that

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
so again yeah we believe this is a
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
direction that we want to go
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
election information portal but we want
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we do it right
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that we have enough time to do it
 
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.950 align:start position:0%
and that we have enough time to do it
properly

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
madam share the only other area that i
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
would address
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
is part four
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
relative to the statements that are
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
filed by political committees and
 
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.870 align:start position:0%
filed by political committees and
candidates

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh senator gray uh is addressing
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh an important concern and that is that
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh we have many legislators that are
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
filing these reports now
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
on the online electronic system
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
that works great once the information is
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
the information is in a searchable
 
00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:25.910 align:start position:0%
the information is in a searchable
database

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
so individuals that are interested in
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
different parts of
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
campaign finance reporting can go there
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
and see trends and see who's
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
contributing what to the candidates
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
but we do have a pretty significant
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
number of candidates
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
and candidates running for high offices
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
that file paper reports which is still
 
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.950 align:start position:0%
that file paper reports which is still
permissible

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
permissible
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
under the statute many times those
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
reports are hand written
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
and often times those are not legible
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of being able to easily read
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
the information that's being reported
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes we receive type documents in a
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
font size so
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
small that we literally need a
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
magnifying glass to be able to
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
read the content and those are very
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
difficult things to
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
put in pdf form on our website and
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know and have it readable to the
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
general public so
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
i think that the effort to standardize
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
the type of reporting and at a minimum
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
requiring that to
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
be legible and that there be a minimum
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
font size
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's required is really important to
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh transparency and disclosure and
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
so we think this part of the bill uh
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
is an important uh uh
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
it would just be important to the
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
process with that i would be happy to
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
answer any additional questions
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you oh this is the room yeah
 
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.950 align:start position:0%
thank you oh this is the room yeah
representative

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
sorry guys thank you madam chair and
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
font size and different you know
 
00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:28.870 align:start position:0%
font size and different you know
standards

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
to do their reports uh in the
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
handwritten format
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
well that yeah that will be a
 
00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:39.829 align:start position:0%
well that yeah that will be a
determination

00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
by this committee and and your
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
current part in the senate um
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
you know the online uh campaign finance
 
00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:50.790 align:start position:0%
you know the online uh campaign finance
system

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh is actually working quite well and
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
at some point uh it would uh
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
make sense to to certainly move in that
 
00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:00.470 align:start position:0%
make sense to to certainly move in that
direction

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
when when we first started uh when that
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
was first created
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
there was uh significant concern that
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know there were a good number of
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
legislators that
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know didn't have access to laptops
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
and computers to keep spreadsheets
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh and things like that you know i i
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
think that is
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
um uh less of a argument uh to make
 
00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:21.990 align:start position:0%
um uh less of a argument uh to make
today

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh because uh you know everybody is
 
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.109 align:start position:0%
uh because uh you know everybody is
doing

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
things online you know these these
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
meetings are a good example of that
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
where you know we're just moving to
 
00:42:30.079 --> 00:42:31.910 align:start position:0%
where you know we're just moving to
online

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh forums you know for having these
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
discussions so
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
the access to the technology uh i think
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
has dramatically improved
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
since we first implemented the the
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
online filing system
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
um at some point you may want to say you
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
know we'll
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
you know we'll start with the top tier
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
of candidates um
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know governor uh executive council
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
senate um and you know start there
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
making it a requirement
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
and then moving on to the house and the
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
county offices um
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
but again ultimately that you recall
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative barry yes deputy stanley
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
questions about the reporting side of it
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
and um this
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
is legible and as you are aware i'm
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most prolific
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
readers of campaign finance reports in
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
um this is a real actual problem um
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
and you see these candidates for a major
 
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.150 align:start position:0%
and you see these candidates for a major
office

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
through an including governor who filed
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
these reports
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
on paper and by the end and i used the
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
online system i'm the treasurer i think
 
00:43:38.079 --> 00:43:38.390 align:start position:0%
online system i'm the treasurer i think
for

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
three different uh committees um so i'm
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
a political user of the online system as
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
well it's incredibly easy to use
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i just have to wonder why why are
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
these campaigns which are sophisticated
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
raising more than five thousand dollars
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
why are they not using this online
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
system that's in my opinion
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
makes life easy it takes care of all the
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
weird nuances of campaign finance law
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
for you uh
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
richard barry i i would first of all
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
believe that you are a prolific reader
 
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.109 align:start position:0%
believe that you are a prolific reader
of

00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
the information that's available in
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
those campaign finance reports
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
i you know i really don't want to
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
speculate on why a particular candidate
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
would not want to file it online but i
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
will just confirm that
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know there are there are quite a few
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
major candidates that continue to file
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
their reports uh on paper
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
i would call it not true follow-up
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead receive many requests for
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
i i i i'm not questioning i completely
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
heard your question but
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative barry you're still
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
showing on my screen is muted and
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
there's a little
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm i'm coming through the
 
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.030 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm i'm coming through the
uh

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'm coming through the room um
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
how many requests does your office
 
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.750 align:start position:0%
how many requests does your office
receive

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
receive
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
for committees and campaigns to refile
 
00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:14.390 align:start position:0%
for committees and campaigns to refile
paperwork

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
um it happens every election
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know i would have to go back and
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
find some examples for you
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
of what those look like and i'm happy to
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
you when we receive them we we put them
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
up online
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
um which is our practice
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
in the form that they received if we
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
receive some complaints about somebody
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
in a readable form then we will reach
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
out and approach the candidate
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
and ask them um if they would
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
give us something that we can read this
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah the provision that's being proposed
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
this bill uh would give us the authority
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
to require that
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
if we determine that something is
 
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:05.270 align:start position:0%
if we determine that something is
illegible

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%

i'm seeing none thank you deputy scanlon

00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
89 we'll go through the sections first
 
00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:02.470 align:start position:0%
89 we'll go through the sections first
section

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
has to do with the city chief election
 
00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.190 align:start position:0%
has to do with the city chief election
officer

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
the we believe that the
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
chief election officer in
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
any location here in new hampshire
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
should be a
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire resident if not a resident
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
of the town or city
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
currently the
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
way that the towns are done for the city
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me the cities are done for the
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
city clerk
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
in most communities that is an appointed
 
00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:37.589 align:start position:0%
in most communities that is an appointed
position

00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
and there is no residency requirements
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
there is a city in new hampshire right
 
00:49:43.599 --> 00:49:44.630 align:start position:0%
there is a city in new hampshire right
now

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
whose city clerk is a resident of a
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
different state
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
this bill takes away no duties uh
 
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
the only thing it removes is a title
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
and in accordance with state law
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
at the polling place it's the moderator
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
who is in charge of the election
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
um so again
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
between secretary of state and myself
 
00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.430 align:start position:0%
between secretary of state and myself
we've

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
attempted to do this a couple of
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
different times and
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
maybe this time we'll be be successful
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
we've changed it again
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
um you know to take into some of the
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
comments that we've gotten in the past
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
section two
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the taking a certain
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
the state law prohibited
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
any photographs within the uh guard
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
rails or taking a
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
photograph of ballots um
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
there was a successful court challenge
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh saying that a person could take
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
a photograph of their own ballot
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
that that could lead to people
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
having to vote the way
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
somebody wants and take a picture of the
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
ballot and turn it
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
into that person who's uh but this
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
deals more with just if i'm in there
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i take a picture of somebody
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
especially if we have a ballot
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
which is a two-sided ballot like we did
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
in the last election
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
and could be used in any election that
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
taking the photograph of someone else
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
could also take a
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
photograph of their ballot and with the
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
cameras that we have on all the phones
 
00:51:40.079 --> 00:51:41.510 align:start position:0%
cameras that we have on all the phones
now

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
being very detailed
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
that that picture could be blown up to
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
to see what the
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
how the person voted along with other
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
considerations so
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
we would appreciate you looking at that
 
00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:56.390 align:start position:0%
we would appreciate you looking at that
uh

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
section three allowing the opening of
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
our envelopes and the processes
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
again this was very very very popular
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
with the election officials
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh in the last election it
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
allows a quicker process
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
on election day and what this uh section
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
is attempting to do
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
is separate the opening of the outer
 
00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.710 align:start position:0%
is separate the opening of the outer
envelopes

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
envelopes
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
from the processing of the absentee
 
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.069 align:start position:0%
from the processing of the absentee
ballot

00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple of reasons for that
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
right now the processing of the absentee
 
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.069 align:start position:0%
right now the processing of the absentee
balance

00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh if you go into the temporary
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that we put through would
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
only happen
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
on the friday saturday or monday um
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
half you know after you've printed the
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
the checklist
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
um and then um if a
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
person is found not to have signed the
 
00:52:56.079 --> 00:52:57.030 align:start position:0%
person is found not to have signed the
affidavit

00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
or there is some other irregularity in
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
that affidavit
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh many communities attempted to contact
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh so that they could and i'm going to
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
use the term that is
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
used in the in the lawsuit cure
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
the ballot or fix the problem
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
um there is nothing right now that
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
would preclude a person um
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
putting a ballot into an envelope not
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
supplied by the state
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
or or putting the inner envelope in a
 
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
an envelope not supplied by the state
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
and sending it
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
in my community when that has happened
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh that that
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
envelope is opened because they don't
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
know that a ballot is in there
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then once they realize that the
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
ballot is in there
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's either stapled or taped shut uh
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
and put in with the rest of the balance
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
for processing on election day
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
this works on that same principle
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
and the principle of allowing people to
 
00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:04.549 align:start position:0%
and the principle of allowing people to
cure

00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
cure
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
what it says is that the clerk
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
can open those envelopes after they
 
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.069 align:start position:0%
can open those envelopes after they
arrive

00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
arrive
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh under certain conditions and uh
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
look at those signatures and if they are
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
not executed properly
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh contact the individuals
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
this uh the wording that you see in
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
right now i worked extensively with the
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
aclu so that they
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
understood what was going on and
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
did not object to the language at the
 
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.109 align:start position:0%
did not object to the language at the
time

00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they have formed a
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
different opinion now but at the time
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
this went through the senate they were
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
in agreement with the language
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
this would allow the
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
clerk also to open the envelope in the
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
presence of the voters so if the voter
 
00:55:05.599 --> 00:55:06.549 align:start position:0%
presence of the voters so if the voter
came

00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
came
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
with that sealed envelope to drop it off
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
at city hall
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
this would also say that the court could
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
open it at that time
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
look at the signatures give the example
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
of someone who was
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
heading off you know maybe they're a
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
a snowbird and they're going off to uh
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
to florida they're dropping off that
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
ballot as they're on their way out of
 
00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.470 align:start position:0%
ballot as they're on their way out of
town

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
if the clerk is able to look at it at
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there isn't a problem
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
with the signature of the way the
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
affidavit is filled out
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
or the agent of the person right now we
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
allow family members
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
caregivers etc to be designated
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
to be able to drop the ballot off uh but
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
other ones that came through the mail
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
there would be a
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
date and time that it would need to be
 
00:55:57.839 --> 00:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
date and time that it would need to be
posted

00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
posted
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
so that people could observe uh the
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next section the
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
post-election audit
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
um windham you guys just got done
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
with uh processing the
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
part of the problem with windham is that
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state and the attorney
 
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.670 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state and the attorney
general

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
did not see a way that we could open
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
those ballot boxes
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
to do additional investigation the way
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
that the law was written
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
and preserve a chain of custody etc
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
so this bill it started out with just
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
re-establishing the committee to look
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
into audit procedures for the
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
machine count towns but we've added
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
several sections in there
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the ballot law
 
00:57:04.799 --> 00:57:05.430 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the ballot law
commission

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
if they find that there is a significant
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
difference between the vote
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
announced election night and
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
any recount that was done
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
or that an audit
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
finds a significant difference between
 
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.430 align:start position:0%
finds a significant difference between
the

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
announced vote and
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
the audit that was conducted or if there
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
is other creditable
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
creditable uh information that they have
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
that they may request that the
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
attorney general do an investigation it
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
also has
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
words in there for the attorney general
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
that they are allowed to open up those
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
ballot boxes
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh during the investigation and
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
he doesn't need to wait for the ballot
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
law commission
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
should he have credible information uh
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
that there
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
was something that needs investigation
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
he could do it on his own authority
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
again so it tries to take those things
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
that people said are reasons why we
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't do windham right away
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
and take away those roadblocks and
 
00:58:20.319 --> 00:58:21.750 align:start position:0%
and take away those roadblocks and
barriers

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
barriers
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
to that and the last part
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
since the time i was in the house
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
i have tried to work to reinstate some
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
of the duties for the register of
 
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:41.430 align:start position:0%
of the duties for the register of
probate

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
probate
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
um and let me give you an example why
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
um my son passed away
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
a year ago december my daughter-in-law
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
had to go through the probate process
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
my son did have a trust which most of
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
his assets were in
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
um but the attorney
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
just the attorney and and the fees for
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
the bill was a thousand seven hundred
 
00:59:10.319 --> 00:59:13.670 align:start position:0%
the bill was a thousand seven hundred
dollars

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
and the only things that weren't in the
 
00:59:16.839 --> 00:59:18.069 align:start position:0%
and the only things that weren't in the
trust

00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
was one automobile and a small bank
 
00:59:20.319 --> 00:59:22.150 align:start position:0%
was one automobile and a small bank
account

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
now the attorney did modify the trust
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
document slightly
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
to take my son's name off and to to do
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
the other things
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
but even saying that that was half of
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
and i'll drop down to 800 for the
 
00:59:38.319 --> 00:59:39.430 align:start position:0%
and i'll drop down to 800 for the
probate

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
probate
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
portion of this is ridiculous
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely terrible the cost according
 
00:59:46.799 --> 00:59:48.069 align:start position:0%
absolutely terrible the cost according
to

00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
the information that was supplied
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
by the court system um
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
is about a average is around 170 to 180
 
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.950 align:start position:0%
is about a average is around 170 to 180
dollars

00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
per probate they also receive
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
between six and seven phone calls
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
per um
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
probate filing what this bill does is
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
puts back in the register of probate
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
not to be an advocate for anyone but to
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
help the people through the process
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
telling them this is where you go into
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
the electronic system
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of information that you
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
put into
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
block one block two this is the time
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
period that you should expect
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
for the assignment of the executor this
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
is the time period you have
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
to do the uh assets
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
the inventory and the things that should
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
be included in that
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh not giving them advice on
 
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
legal issues but giving them advice on
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
procedural issues
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
so some of the my republican brethren
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh looked at the twenty dollars
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
this bill says that there'll be an
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
additional fee
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars vice 800 dollars for the
 
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.910 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars vice 800 dollars for the
attorney

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
um a small small fee to pay
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
i believe that many many more people
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
with a person who knows the system
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
and can help them navigate that system
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
that there will be many additional
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
people who would be
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
able to go through the probate process
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
um without the use of an attorney
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
and save themselves hundreds
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
of dollars and
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
the 20 will fund
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
the register of probate it is voluntary
 
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
the counties don't need to do this if
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
but again i implore you
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
to to think about our constituents out
 
01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.829 align:start position:0%
to to think about our constituents out
there

01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
my next step in this is if i can prove
 
01:02:10.559 --> 01:02:11.109 align:start position:0%
my next step in this is if i can prove
that

01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
we are saving the court uh considerable
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
funds uh because of the
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
the questions and different things that
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
are going on
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
is trying to get them to reduce their
 
01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.029 align:start position:0%
is trying to get them to reduce their
fees

01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
for that 20 dollars which we are
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
adding in future legislation and on
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
coming years
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm open to questions
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you senator gray committee members
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
um questions for senator gray
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
um let's try to go through it by section
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
just to
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
sort of see if we can go through it part
 
01:02:50.079 --> 01:02:51.109 align:start position:0%
sort of see if we can go through it part
one

01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the city chief election
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
officer um changing the reference
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
to clerk
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh senator gray
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
he hadn't really had any questions about
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
this section until you brought up
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
a situation in portsmouth where the city
 
01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.589 align:start position:0%
a situation in portsmouth where the city
clerk

01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
isn't a resident of the city
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
when i first started at city clerk in
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
nashua i was a resident of hudson so i
 
01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:22.950 align:start position:0%
nashua i was a resident of hudson so i
suppose

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
a similar situation applies to me what
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
you're trying to accomplish here in
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
regards to the portsmouth city clerk
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
and what effect is this going to have on
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
a city clerk who doesn't live
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
the problem i had is more with someone
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
who doesn't even live in the same state
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
but city or state right now
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
it causes confusion between the
 
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:54.870 align:start position:0%
it causes confusion between the
authority

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the moderator at the polling place
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
and the city
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
chief election official the city clerk
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
that comes into play in recounts
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
it comes into play when there is other
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
decisions to be made
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
the city clerk doesn't have a lot of
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
authority during the election
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
and as clear if you look at the
 
01:04:21.359 --> 01:04:22.870 align:start position:0%
and as clear if you look at the
legislation

01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
they are still in charge of any
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
non-legislative action
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh that's out there if they want to you
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
know have
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
um the posting of the various
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
documents done in a particular manner
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
here in rochester the the city clerk has
 
01:04:43.359 --> 01:04:43.829 align:start position:0%
here in rochester the the city clerk has
these

01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
uh boards that
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
have all the postings again as long as
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
that goes along with the
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
the state law that's fine and
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
so those are the types of things that
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
are in there
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
but again it does cause conflicts
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
at certain times with the authority of
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
the moderator which is spelled out in
 
01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:10.950 align:start position:0%
the moderator which is spelled out in
statute

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh for operating the polling place on
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
election day
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
further question madam chair
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
um so in a situation
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
where a city clerk is perhaps training
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
and supervising
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
up to nine or 12 moderators
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
and you have someone new who's
 
01:05:31.839 --> 01:05:33.349 align:start position:0%
and you have someone new who's
interpreting

01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
interpreting
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
state law in a way that the city clerk
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
knows is incorrect
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
the city clerk will no longer have any
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
authority over that moderator to ensure
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
that that polling place is being
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
operated and run consistent with how
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
all the other polling places in the city
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
i believe that your question doesn't
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
state the situation properly
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
that the moderator is in charge of that
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
that if any resident or any citizen
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire has a problem with a
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
moderator not
 
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
following state law that there is a
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
hotline that can be used during the
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
election that i know here in rochester
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh i have been called upon because i was
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
a moderator for
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
more than 20 years to sit down with
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
new moderators uh and even go to their
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
polling places
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
and help them during their first or
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
second election
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
so that there's many things out there
 
01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.190 align:start position:0%
so that there's many things out there
but

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
the city clerk
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
still has responsibilities in the
 
01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:46.789 align:start position:0%
still has responsibilities in the
statute

01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh and that if there is a disagreement
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
the proper place for that disagreement
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh to be adjudicated is through the
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
and if that is on election day the
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
hotline is available
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you senator no further questions

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%

committee room today thank you go ahead
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
we can hear you
 
01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
we can hear you
okay

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
senator you you quickly observed in your
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that just about everybody has
 
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
a cell phone right now
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
and the ability to take pictures and so
 
01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.870 align:start position:0%
and the ability to take pictures and so
forth

01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'm just concerned about the
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement of something like this given
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
people who go through there and who's
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
going to even notice half of them who do
 
01:08:14.079 --> 01:08:17.189 align:start position:0%
going to even notice half of them who do
this

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
certainly enforcement is always an issue
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
again my hope is that with posting this
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
um you know at the polling place
 
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.990 align:start position:0%
um you know at the polling place
possibly

01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh that it will self-police
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
itself in most cases um
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
again you know the enforcement may be
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
a person that takes a picture uh that
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
the moderator might just ask them
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
to delete that photo uh before they
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
transmit it to any place
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
but again what we're trying to do is
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
discourage the people not uh
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know have a confrontation with the
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
voter etc
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
but you know to set out in the statute
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
a code that we believe that they should
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
adhere to for their behavior at the
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
and i believe that this even though it
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
may not
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
be easily enforceable that it will
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
tend to lessen the occurrence
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
thank you uh follow up madam chairman
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
um senator um just wondering have any
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
local election officials requested this
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislation or is it something
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
based on your own observations it was
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
requested by the secretary of state
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien i'm
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%

01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.149 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%

yeah we're not yeah if there's something
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%

01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
something offline at some point with it
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%

01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots

to election day so that
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
that just means they have to open
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
no that just means that just means
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
they have to open the outer envelope at
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
some point they don't
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
have to open it on that they don't have
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
the intent of the legislation is that
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
they would
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
on an ongoing basis opening those
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
open those outer envelopes inspect the
 
01:12:39.199 --> 01:12:41.350 align:start position:0%
open those outer envelopes inspect the
ballot

01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
for the minimal things that you see in
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
and then if there is a problem that is
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
identified try to contact the voter
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
through the information that's supplied
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
voters absentee ballot request
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
which it does request information
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
such as the uh email number
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
or cell phone and then attempt to
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
accept that ballot uh right now
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
that if you
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
do state law without the exceptions that
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
we put in for the covid
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh back when i was a moderator if i
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
received a ballot
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
on election day uh from the clerk
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh opened that uh outer envelope two
 
01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.229 align:start position:0%
uh opened that uh outer envelope two
hours

01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
after the uh uh polls open
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
um then
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
notice that the affidavit wasn't signed
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
that really there wasn't any opportunity
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
for me to to accept that ballot
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that that's what is
 
01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.990 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that that's what is
intended

01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
intended
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
i think that if we can give the people
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
to get their ballot accepted
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
that that is what is desired
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
and this separating the
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
opening of the outer envelope from the
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
processing of the absentee ballots
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
allowing the clerk to do it actually
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
requiring the clerk to do it
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
ahead of time check those things and
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
if they have the information to contact
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
the voter
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
contact them is in the best interest of
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
the democratic process
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay my follow-up question so i do
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
understand your intent um
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
so in lines 24 and 25
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
um it does require the clerks to open
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
the outer envelope so there are actually
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
three steps there's the opening of the
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
outer envelope
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
the reviewing of the affidavit
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
and then the final processing which is
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
on election day
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
but the so they're allowed to open the
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
outer envelope
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
and review the affidavit and then if
 
01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.350 align:start position:0%
and review the affidavit and then if
there's

01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
another pre-processing day with with a
 
01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.030 align:start position:0%
another pre-processing day with with a
team

01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
team
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the election officials say on the
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
saturday before the election
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
they will have to go through that
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
process again with that ballot
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
and then mark the checklist
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
i did not touch the statute about the
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
what the moderator has to do in
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
processing an absentee ballot
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
and the reason i didn't touch that is
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
because of the court order
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh for in joining
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
the state from checking
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
now what the process would be
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
um is certainly the moderator would also
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
look at those signatures
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that the affidavit was
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
filled out properly and that at that
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
time they would be allowed
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
to put the annotations aloud
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
onto the checklist therefore
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
allowing them to process the balance
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
more quickly on election day
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
from my many years as an election
 
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:24.950 align:start position:0%
from my many years as an election
official

01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
official
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
moderator the only time i ever
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
had any difficulty at all uh was on a
 
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.030 align:start position:0%
had any difficulty at all uh was on a
presidential

01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
presidential
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
election and then with proper planning
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
that too wasn't a problem i would hire
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
an extra individual or two
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
to assist me in that process and i was
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
always able to efficiently process those
 
01:16:49.679 --> 01:16:51.910 align:start position:0%
always able to efficiently process those
balance

01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
balance
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for taking my question
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative terezian
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
again uh senator great for taking the
 
01:16:58.960 --> 01:16:59.830 align:start position:0%
again uh senator great for taking the
question

01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
um much of my question was answered with
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
question question to receive um
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
but the what i've got left i guess is uh
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
it appears that the you know there's a
 
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.950 align:start position:0%
it appears that the you know there's a
two-fold

01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
two-fold
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
reason for uh wanting to count
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
or open the up ballot of st ballots
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
election day uh one is certainly
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
um posted free up time on election day
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
for town first and so forth
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
and the other two address um
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
some of the things you mentioned like uh
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
to cure any problems such as commitment
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
signature incorrect name and so forth
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
is there any data on what you know
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
to what extent that's a problem for
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
people forgetting to put that name or
 
01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:49.430 align:start position:0%
people forgetting to put that name or
sign

01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
sign
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the number
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
i do not have any factual data
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
um secretary of state may um
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
in the phone calls that the secretary of
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
state conducted
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh with the supervisors of the checklist
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
town clerks and with the moderators
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
after the election it was a very very
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
very popular thing to do
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
i wanted to add that
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that the aclu asked
 
01:18:24.719 --> 01:18:25.510 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that the aclu asked
me

01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
was whether or not there is a precursor
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
to reinstituting the signature
 
01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.990 align:start position:0%
to reinstituting the signature
verification

01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
verification
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
and my answer to him was that if if i
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
were doing this
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
i would tell him right up front but
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
to reinstitute that signature
 
01:18:44.239 --> 01:18:45.669 align:start position:0%
to reinstitute that signature
verification

01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
verification
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh requires a couple of different things
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
a method of cure which is the reason the
 
01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.630 align:start position:0%
a method of cure which is the reason the
aclu

01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
aclu
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
asked this this would be the method to
 
01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.709 align:start position:0%
asked this this would be the method to
cure

01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
cure
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
but also would involve training provided
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
and a petition from the secretary of
 
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
state's office to the courts
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead further question thank you so i
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
under this provision if it would become
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
law there would be a
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
disadvantage for anybody who voted
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely ballot
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh when their ballot didn't get to the
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
top of to
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
let's say the night before election or
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
whenever the cutoff is the morning of
 
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
the election day
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
they that individual or individuals
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the same
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
chance to have their
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
any deficiencies corrected
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
that is one of the issues that the aclu
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
discussed with me
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
but i assured them that you know if i'm
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
doing as much as i can to make sure that
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
that ballot is counted
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
and that they have fulfilled the process
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else i can do nothing
 
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.350 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else i can do nothing
greater

01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
greater
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
and if i limit um you know that
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
only ballots can be opened at
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
two days before the election then i may
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
be taking
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
away the ability to cure from that
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
individual who dropped their ballot
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
off on their way to florida um
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know and and taking and depriving
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
them of their
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
right to franchise thank you
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron well thank you
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
ma'am chair
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
senator gray i too uh wanted to
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
address the language uh of line 17
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
and 18. uh am i clear then understanding
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
that it's your on page two
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
um it's your intent that this process
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
shall be conducted for every city town
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
and state election
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh in all cities and towns it's not a
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
local option
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to be mandated because it
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
says shell
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
the opening of the outer envelopes yes
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
it shall be done
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
and done by every city town village
 
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.470 align:start position:0%
and done by every city town village
district

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
etc yes the second part of that
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
and this is a concern because i think it
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
would be a logistical nightmare
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying that this needs to be done
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
on the day prior to election day as
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
a day prior to election day and i'm just
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
thinking of a situation
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
in nashua where in a state general
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
election there are going to be thousands
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
of ballots
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to be opened and
 
01:21:38.239 --> 01:21:39.669 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to be opened and
examined

01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
examined
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
the clerk or someone in the office will
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
then have to follow up on a number of
 
01:21:43.199 --> 01:21:43.910 align:start position:0%
then have to follow up on a number of
those

01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
trying to contact the voters and on that
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
same day
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
they're trying to set up the polling
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
places in in nine schools in the case of
 
01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.470 align:start position:0%
places in in nine schools in the case of
nashua

01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
i just don't see how this can physically
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
be done
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
was it your intent to say the day before
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
an election or a day before the election
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh again i'd have to go back you know
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
you didn't give me the page number so
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure which line
 
01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:17.270 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure which line
sixteen

01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh the town of state clerk or their
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
destiny shall open the outer envelope of
 
01:22:21.679 --> 01:22:22.149 align:start position:0%
destiny shall open the outer envelope of
all

01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots received
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
prior to 5 pm on
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
the day prior to the election the
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
envelopes containing
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
all right the intent of that
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
is that this has been an ongoing process
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
from the first day that they have
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
allowed people to vote
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
absentee and that those ballots
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
maybe once a week during the first part
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
of it but
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
as we get closer to the election opened
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
on a
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
daily basis to make sure that they are
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
so that there isn't a
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
a bunch of ballots and remember a lot of
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
our absentee ballots as you
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
remember are people who vote right there
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
at the polls
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
and this again
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
would have the provision in there that
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
while you're still there at the poll
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
that whether you seal that outer
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
envelope or not i really don't care
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
but the clerk would be able to verify uh
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
your signature
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
on the affidavit so uh saying that there
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
will be a
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
ton of these things happening on
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
the day before the election is not
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
what the intent is the intent is that
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
this be
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
an ongoing process so that there isn't
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
a slew of these things happening on the
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
day before
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
and again all those people who voted in
 
01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:55.750 align:start position:0%
and again all those people who voted in
person

01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
you know it would be a much easier
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
process then because
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
you could just uh tell them not to seal
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
the outer envelope as
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh they would hand them back to the
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
clerk and would be good to go
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron i see your issue
 
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
in the wording of the statement it does
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
make it look like it's all supposed to
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
be done
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
then thank you madam karen and i and i
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
don't have any further questions
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
the election audit counting device
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%

01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
chair uh
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
senator my question pertains to page 5
 
01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:49.910 align:start position:0%
senator my question pertains to page 5
line

01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
36 um all the other
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
sections of this bill
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
have an effective date of either a
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
specific date or 60 days after
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
passage this one says it's effective
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
upon passage
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
would this in any way undermine or
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
override what we did with senate bill 43
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
no um in fact i think that this supports
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 43. if ins uh the
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
execution of the audit in windham uh you
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
find that there's a significant
 
01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.470 align:start position:0%
find that there's a significant
difference

01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
in the election for the governor or the
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
election for the u.s senator which you
 
01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:34.670 align:start position:0%
included in your
 
01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:36.790 align:start position:0%
included in your
[Music]

01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
modification to the bill this would
 
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.790 align:start position:0%
modification to the bill this would
allow

01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
the secretary of i should say the
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
to say do i need to expand the
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
investigation into other communities for
 
01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:50.550 align:start position:0%
investigation into other communities for
that

01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
one or both of those elections and check
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
to see if there were
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
regulated therapies there which senate
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill 43 would not allow you to do
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
because it is specific to windom so
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
the ward 3 in manchester uh
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
also had a significant difference
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
statistically you know from the averages
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
of how they normally voted
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that was one that the attorney
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
general said well you know maybe we
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
ought to look at that
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow them to expand
 
01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.189 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow them to expand
that

01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
in you know request uh let me stay
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
emphatically that i believe that what we
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
are actually going to find in windham
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
is that the hand count conducted at the
 
01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.910 align:start position:0%
is that the hand count conducted at the
archives

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
archives
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
lost control of one or more of the
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
ballot thank you senator gray we have a
 
01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.110 align:start position:0%
ballot thank you senator gray we have a
process

01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
established for sb3 and i really don't
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
want speculation
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
as to election results coming forward
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron for the question
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
no further questions thank you
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
committee members representative
 
01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.310 align:start position:0%
committee members representative
muirhead

01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
muirhead
 
01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i wanted to
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
inquire about
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
the very beginning of this section
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
where the procedure for
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
populating the um the committee
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
is described at lines page 3 lines
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
30 to 30 4.
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
um i wonder if you considered
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
um a process that ensured bipartisan
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
representation on the committee
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
it seems plausible that or it seems
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
consistent with this process that the
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee might be populated by
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
um let me go back and
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
two members of the senate and
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
then three members by the
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house that is normally
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
the standard language that we put in
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh generally what happens there is that
 
01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.629 align:start position:0%
uh generally what happens there is that
the

01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house with that language
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
would appoint
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
um one member from each party and then
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
the third member
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh maybe whomever uh is chosen
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the senate when there's two members
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh generally that is
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
one member from each party but we
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
rely on the integrity of the two
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
individuals that are doing the
 
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.030 align:start position:0%
individuals that are doing the
appointment

01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there is bipartisan
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
representation on these type of
 
01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:43.430 align:start position:0%
representation on these type of
committees

01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair would
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
you be willing to amend it to
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
to specify that expectation seems like a
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
very prudent
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
sensible expectation why not make it
 
01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:54.550 align:start position:0%
sensible expectation why not make it
explicit

01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
explicit
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
this were will be legislating for for
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
posterity that may or may not remember
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
these conventions
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh again the bill is in the uh control
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
of the house
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh who are the ones who will make those
 
01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.550 align:start position:0%
uh who are the ones who will make those
decisions

01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
but if i'm using that logic
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
then i need to go into an awful lot of
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
bills that have
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh committees and put that same language
 
01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:22.149 align:start position:0%
uh committees and put that same language
in

01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that we've had a problem
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
in making sure that these type of
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
committees are bipartisan
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
and uh therefore i personally don't see
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%

representative mcdonald thank you madam

representative mcdonald thank you madam
chairman

01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
um and again good morning senator
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
um historically candidates for register
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
of probate
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
have often been party activists of
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
either political party
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they have probate
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
experience sometimes they have not
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
but when they come into the office it'd
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
always be a seasoned staff it usually be
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
a seasoned staff to back them up
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
that of course is no longer the case
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
given changes over the last decade uh do
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
you envision any kind of training or
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
or how would a party activist with no
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
probate experience
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
meet the responsibilities of the office
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
if they were elected into this
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
well i i point to other elected
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
officials that we have right now
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
um that the registered deeds
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
um oh the appointment of the
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
deputy register of deeds deputy register
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
probate or the finance
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
person in the county for the treasurer
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
and that the county commissioners
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
because they do
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
have the responsibility of making sure
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
that the services are provided
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
if they in conjunction with the county
 
01:31:34.719 --> 01:31:35.910 align:start position:0%
if they in conjunction with the county
convention

01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
convention
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
decides that they are going to have
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
these duties for the register of probate
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
and someone is elected
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
whom they feel is incapable of doing
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
those duties
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh they would also be able to uh um
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
take and elect a deputy or appoint
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
appointed deputy
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
to that person and through the use of
 
01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.189 align:start position:0%
to that person and through the use of
the

01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh controlling the salary of
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
the register of probate and the
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
what would be the deputy i believe that
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
as in the past speaking historically
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
has happened many many times before that
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
those controls would be exercised by
 
01:32:23.679 --> 01:32:24.310 align:start position:0%
those controls would be exercised by
those

01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
county commissioners thank you
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
representative barry um yes so senator
 
01:32:34.239 --> 01:32:35.590 align:start position:0%
representative barry um yes so senator
great

01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
a point has been made quite often by the
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
opponents of this provision
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
about experience and who we elect but to
 
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
my knowledge
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
and maybe you can confirm this for me
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
outside of county attorney we don't
 
01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:48.229 align:start position:0%
outside of county attorney we don't
require

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
experience for any other office to be
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
elected including state representative
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
governor executive council um the only
 
01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.390 align:start position:0%
governor executive council um the only
requirement

01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
is age the exception of current attorney
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
so why
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
is there a provision in here that says
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
they have to be experienced or is it
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
just like
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
every other elected office like every
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
other election office and
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes i think people have told me
 
01:33:11.679 --> 01:33:12.149 align:start position:0%
sometimes i think people have told me
that

01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
further questions from panelists
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative barry you have any
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else on the panel on section
 
01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.750 align:start position:0%
anybody else on the panel on section
five

01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
representative lane yes thank you madam
 
01:33:38.639 --> 01:33:39.189 align:start position:0%
representative lane yes thank you madam
chair

01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
um i noticed that
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's a provision about the
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
archives putting things older than
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
i think it was anything older than 40
 
01:33:48.239 --> 01:33:49.430 align:start position:0%
i think it was anything older than 40
years

01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
that will make it very difficult for
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
people to conduct title
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh because they're going to have to go
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
to the county and then they're going to
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
have to go to the state archives or
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
anything that's older than 40.
 
01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
is there some reason that that cutoff is
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
made and
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
and why we're doing that
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
the original cutoff in the original
 
01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:16.310 align:start position:0%
the original cutoff in the original
legislation

01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
was actually 35 years and at the
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
request of a couple of different people
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
including the
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
court system was changed to 40 years a
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
lot of the
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
research that is done is
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
actually only done back to 40 years
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
for the property records
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
and the availability at the the archives
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
um and if the secretary of state is
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
still on
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
i believe that their process is to
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
um take in and make these records
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh digitize them and make them available
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
so that it actually may be easier to
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
search the records that are
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%

registered probate
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
and have a long history with this
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
issue going back almost 40 years
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
in 1983 i was a member of judiciary
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee when we
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
unified the court system prior to that
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
the county was responsible for the
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
superior and probate courts
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
they were part of county government this
 
01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.629 align:start position:0%
they were part of county government this
bill

01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
tries to pull them back under the county
 
01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:31.910 align:start position:0%
tries to pull them back under the county
umbrella

01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
umbrella
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm opposed to part five of this
 
01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.109 align:start position:0%
and i'm opposed to part five of this
bill

01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't make any sense
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
organizationally financially
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
or logistically it might have made sense
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
to have the
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
registered probate who served as the
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
clerk of the probate court
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
be part of county government when the
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
county was responsible for the probate
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
court the county had the courthouse the
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
county paid all the employees
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
during the unification of the court the
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
court system
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
the state took over those
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but they had to leave
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
the register
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
of probate the title and the duties
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
because it's mentioned in the
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
constitution so between 1983 and 2010
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
the register of probate was a full-time
 
01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:19.990 align:start position:0%
the register of probate was a full-time
job

01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
with a full-time salary and a staff
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
that could help train anybody who was
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
elected who
 
01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
may not have been aware of all the
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
duties of the office
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
in 2010 there was a court efficiency
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee i was a member of that
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
and the court looked at ways of
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
being more efficient in their operation
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
and customer service
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
and basically
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
improving the way they operated so they
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
did a lot of study about
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
how much time was spent answering the
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
phones going to the counter
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that they came in
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill that passed in 2010 that
 
01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:03.669 align:start position:0%
bill that passed in 2010 that
consolidated

01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
consolidated
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
the probate court the district court and
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
the family court
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
they were left with the constitutional
 
01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.030 align:start position:0%
they were left with the constitutional
office

01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
of the register probate the
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
the bill in 2010 took the duties of the
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
registered probate
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
and gave them to a court appointed
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh clerk of the probate division of the
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
but you're left with the title the
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional office of
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
the registered probate and the duties
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
they left for that
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
office were to be the record keeper of
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
where the documents were held
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
so they they were the keeper of the
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
historical documents and you can see
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh on uh page eight say uh
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
line line twelve the old language the
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
register probably
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for coordinating with the
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and the
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the circuit
 
01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:02.390 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the circuit
court

01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
the preservation of any closed files
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
having potential for historical
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
significance and then you go down to
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
pick up on line 19 the register shall
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
maintain a current index describing the
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
location of any files
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
which have been removed from the core
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
section those were the only duties left
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
for the elected
 
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
register of probate i've i said
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think i could do that so i ran for
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
register of probate on a platform of
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
doing away with this
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
basically unnecessary position it would
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
require a constitutional amendment
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
the constitutional amendment did not
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
pass so the uh the office is still there
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
the duties are very limited in 2010 with
 
01:39:42.239 --> 01:39:42.629 align:start position:0%
the duties are very limited in 2010 with
that

01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
circuit court bill they said well gee
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's very few duties left we
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
but we have to uh maintain it because of
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
its constitutional
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh position and so they said the pay for
 
01:39:53.119 --> 01:39:54.070 align:start position:0%
uh position and so they said the pay for
the the

01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
registered probate will be 100 a year
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's paid for by the state
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
so this bill tries to pull them away
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
and pull them back into county
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
government where they haven't been for
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
almost 40 years
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the goal is to assist the parties
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
with their probate court filings
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
the counties are given the authority to
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
set the salary for them and they don't
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
want the
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
county taxpayers to be on the hook so
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
they raised the
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
entry fees there is no fiscal note on
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much money it would
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
raise i'm told there are about 10
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
000 filings uh in probate court each
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
year so maybe there's a pot of 200 000
 
01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
but without a fiscal note we don't know
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh sponsor of the bill said he compared
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
it he says well
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you rather pay twenty dollars
 
01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
than eight hundred dollars well this is
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
a twenty dollar surcharge on top
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the existing probate court fees which
 
01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:58.229 align:start position:0%
of the existing probate court fees which
are

01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
maybe a hundred dollars or two hundred
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
dollars depending on what your issue is
 
01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.310 align:start position:0%
dollars depending on what your issue is
um

01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
so the registered probate would have the
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
duty to assist the parties and their
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
salary was set
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
be set by the county um
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's no provision in here that that
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
says that the
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
registered probe is going to have access
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
to any of the probate court information
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
there's no money in here for a computer
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
there's no money for a desk
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
it says they can be co-located at the
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
okay if i am a person try struggling
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
with a probate matter
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
and i know that the register of probit
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
is supposed to help me where am i
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to find him
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think i'd look first in the
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds but
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
so finding the person having them have
 
01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:47.830 align:start position:0%
so finding the person having them have
the

01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
access to the information that might be
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
helpful i i think is
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
is not just not going to work uh the
 
01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
probate division if you look at the
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
court website
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
it has a robust website with detailed
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
instructions and information
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
and for people who don't have a computer
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
they do have a call center
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
where they all the calls for the whole
 
01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
court system get picked up
 
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
at a call center and you can ask a
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
question about a case in superior court
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
you can ask about probate court
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
they have access to the information this
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
staff is trained
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
so having a elected registered probate
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
be responsible for something that's
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
already being covered
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
by trained personnel i think doesn't
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
make any sense
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
i hope that you will amend out part five
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to take any
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee who
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
have questions
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
i have a question madam chair
 
01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:51.590 align:start position:0%
i have a question madam chair
representative

01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
and chair thank you madam speaker for
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
just so uh i'm clear on this so each
 
01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:58.870 align:start position:0%
just so uh i'm clear on this so each
county

01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
currently has one register of probate
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
and they do no work
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
right 800 a year might correct them
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's right yes when i when i was
 
01:43:13.990 --> 01:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
elected to register a probate i went
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
over to the
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
the courthouse uh the day i was sworn in
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and introduced myself they were nice
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
enough to give me a tour
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
and i didn't have to go back there or do
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
anything i i did not collect the hundred
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
dollars or during my campaign i said i
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
am not going to take money
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
for not doing anything that just
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be right so i didn't collect my
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and i think some of the
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
other registers didn't either
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
but yes there's one in each county and
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
their only obligation is
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
as i pointed out is to coordinate with
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state and the
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
administrative judge
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
about where records are held and that's
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
done by staff
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cody
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
i did not have any questions i just
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to welcome the speaker
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
back to the committee i want to
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that representative cody was
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
there at the creation
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
he was there when we did unified court
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
back in 1983
 
01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
where we think representative cody might
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
have been here when the building was
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
built he's been up here so long and i
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
i was there when the building was
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
remodeled for sure
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
there you go yes all right
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh further questions from committee
 
01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:32.470 align:start position:0%
uh further questions from committee
members

01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative barry speaker you make
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
the point
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
in your statement that most of the
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
functions are done by professional staff
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
but as a counterpoint could i also say
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
that that is the case for most of
 
01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:43.750 align:start position:0%
that that is the case for most of
government

01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
the governor does not the governor has a
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
policy director
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
the counselors have assistants that help
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
them most
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
work by government is in fact done by
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
professional staff is it not
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's right it's currently done by the
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
the court staff
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
and the the registered probate has no
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
interaction doesn't have a desk doesn't
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
when i campaigned i said you don't even
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
get a ballpoint pen
 
01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
you have no connection
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
to the the court staff you're an elected
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
official and if you're part of
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be part of county
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
government they have even less
 
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.830 align:start position:0%
government they have even less
inclination

01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
inclination
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill talked about
 
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
because i wondered why the county
 
01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.310 align:start position:0%
because i wondered why the county
commissioners

01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
would be appointing the deputy it to me
 
01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.070 align:start position:0%
would be appointing the deputy it to me
that that

01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
seemed very strange and now i understand
 
01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.510 align:start position:0%
seemed very strange and now i understand
that

01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
he thought that the commissioners would
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
appoint somebody who had the
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
professional expertise
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
but to have that person be a part of
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
county government instead of being
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
part of the court system doesn't make
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
any sense to me
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you further question from
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee members um i did
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
ask and send a invitation notice
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
to judiciary because of the nature of
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
the content of this bill
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to ask if there are any
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
members of judiciary with questions
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative horgan welcome
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you very much madam
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
chair so um
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
we dealt with the probate registered
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
probate issue in the judiciary you were
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
on a
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
you're on the subcommittee together and
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
um so i i support
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
i support the basic concept of restoring
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
the registered probate i'm not sure if
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
this particular version
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
the bill is the one that i would want to
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
go forward i think
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
this this is a function that the
 
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
judiciary took over from the executive
 
01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.669 align:start position:0%
judiciary took over from the executive
branch

01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:39.679 align:start position:0%
branch
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
well i've been following this since 2009
 
01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's been going on since
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
1983 and um so they they're doing a good
 
01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.750 align:start position:0%
1983 and um so they they're doing a good
job

01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
i mean this area is doing a good job of
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
serving the clients but i still think
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
they could do a better job of the
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
storage to register probate that's a
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
very very complicated uh
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
issue it would be analogous to the
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds we talked about the
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
fees for the
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh register of probate the uh i would
 
01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.350 align:start position:0%
uh register of probate the uh i would
actually

01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
favor continuing to support it through
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
fees just like judiciary does and the
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
registry of these
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
this is somewhat controversial but they
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
do charge fees which
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
actually make a surplus which goes back
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
to county government and i
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
i would not be against doing that for
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
the registers of probate um
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
speaker scitec even though she has a
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
different position
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
on this uh on this end than
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
um and i did she gave i think a very
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
good summary of the of the facts and the
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
long history of this so
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
um basically that free i think actually
 
01:47:41.119 --> 01:47:42.390 align:start position:0%
um basically that free i think actually
we

01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
eliminated the position in 2009 i think
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
was during the budget trailer but
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
2010 and 2009 that's about the same time
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
period um
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
and so that's i've been working on this
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
issue several times and uh
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
so that we have a constitutional office
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
that has few of any duties so they do
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
the state archives came in they do work
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state's office
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
and the state archivist on preserving
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
the historical files which is uh
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
um also the registry engaged preserving
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
their historical files we actually
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
passed a bill that expanded the duties
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
slightly so they can use the existing
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
funding that
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
state archives does the state archive
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
gets uh
 
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
has ample is has an ample uh ample
 
01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:26.070 align:start position:0%
has ample is has an ample uh ample
funding

01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
through the various fees that it charges
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
to carry on its operations so they can
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
share a little bit with their registered
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
probate they can help the archives with
 
01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:33.590 align:start position:0%
probate they can help the archives with
that

01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
part of it so that's uh so that's uh
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
so space i do like the concept of part
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
five i'm not necessarily sure that i
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
would want to pass this exact version of
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
it and there's been several other
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
several attempts at working on this um
 
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
ever since we eliminated the duties of
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
registered probate they are by the way
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
currently they're elected by county but
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
they're currently state officials and so
 
01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:56.470 align:start position:0%
they're currently state officials and so
far

01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're officials at all so not actually
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
part of county government we would have
 
01:48:59.520 --> 01:48:59.990 align:start position:0%
part of county government we would have
to

01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
technically put them back in there and
 
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
they presumably would
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
need a staff and i guess staff like
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
everybody else
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
is uh hired by the county commissioners
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
after the county commissioners come in
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i've um
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
so i that's what i have to say about
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
that there's two other
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
topics are near and dear to my heart
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
that i've worked on over the years one
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
remember part two about taking uh photos
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
within the guardrail that's
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh kind of another attempt to get the
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
same goal as the infamous ballot selfie
 
01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:28.310 align:start position:0%
same goal as the infamous ballot selfie
bill

01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i probably shouldn't admit this but
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
i was the prime sponsor of that
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
and uh that was a very strange thing
 
01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:35.189 align:start position:0%
and uh that was a very strange thing
because

01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody until this came
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
along until
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
my bill was passed which actually made
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
it through the legislative process
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
pretty easily nobody
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
really thought of taking pictures of the
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
ballot and posting on facebook it wasn't
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
really a thing that many people wanted
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
even though it was already illegal and
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
then we clarified the law suddenly
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
everybody wants suddenly this be came
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
with you there's a huge brouhaha over
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
and everybody wants to post their
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
ballots on facebook and uh
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh there's a federal court decision
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much uh that's another i pretty
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
much like abandoned that effort i think
 
01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:10.070 align:start position:0%
much like abandoned that effort i think
probably

01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
probably retrospect i wish i hadn't
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
taken on that issue even though i think
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
the concerns behind it were right so
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
another way of doing it i think that's
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh what's in part two
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
um yes it's part two
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
yeah part two so part three i'm neutral
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
on i mean i'm
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
afraid to make any changes uh to
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
election procedures just after all the
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
turmoil of the last election
 
01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
obviously anything that makes it more
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
complicated uh is
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
not good but it seems sensible i will
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
stay on
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
by representing stratfor county district
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
six the towns of durham and madbury
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
which is college town so i'm interested
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
i thought there's a little bit irony and
 
01:50:47.199 --> 01:50:48.790 align:start position:0%
i thought there's a little bit irony and
uh

01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
irony that we're very concerned about
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
snowbird dropping off the absentee
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
ballot on their way
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
i guess to florida i guess you're going
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
to drop it off in november and the way
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
down to florida for the winter
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
and certainly they absolutely have the
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
right to vote here when we're not quite
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
as concerned about the rights of
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
people who spend the whole winter here
 
01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:07.510 align:start position:0%
people who spend the whole winter here
spend

01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
spend
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
um you know nine months out of the year
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
going to school but that's uh
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's i guess that's uh i'll just leave
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
it at that
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
and part one i think it's unnecessary
 
01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
finally part three
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
i think we there are a lot of doubts
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
about the accuracy the voting machines
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly it was very
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
i was suspicious of the windham results
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
like even before there was the whole
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
well i guess i don't want to speculate
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
about what happened i think actually
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh i think probably except to say i
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
think probably the original vote total
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
was probably
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
the correct one and that's still
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
speculation you told me you just didn't
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
want to do that
 
01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that uh yes i trust
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
some machines but not 100
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
and certainly uh that uh committee and
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
the windham
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
it's not speculation say that people are
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
suspicious about the wind and results so
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know this reviving this committee
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing so that's
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh so basically i like part two i like
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
part four
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'm neutral in part three i'm opposed to
 
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
part one and i like the concept of part
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
five it's one of my favorite issues and
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
i was
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
thinking of introducing a bill in 2021
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
but i basically didn't do so
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
mostly just because uh the house is not
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
really operating at
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
full capacity so i was encouraged
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
by my caucus's leadership at least not
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
to introduce any bills that couldn't be
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
put off to 2022 or some other year so
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
that's why i decided to put that one
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
aside but i'm
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
not just pleased that senator gray
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
decided to go ahead and take another
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
try at it so um you know
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
probably so maybe we'll do some more
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
work on it this year
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
next year or maybe not so that's uh
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's my positions i'd be happy to take
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
any questions if anybody has any
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative horrigan does
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you for being
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%

01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on this bill is kate

corgan kate joins us um
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair thank you for
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony my name is kate
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
horgan i serve as the executive director
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire association of
 
01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:34.149 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire association of
counties

01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
the counties are weighing in on part
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
five which is the registers of probate
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
while we believe this bill is well
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
intentioned to assist members of the
 
01:53:43.599 --> 01:53:44.470 align:start position:0%
intentioned to assist members of the
public

01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh this would put an additional burden
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
on county governments
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh these duties right now have been in
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch's jurisdiction for
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
quite some time and do not lie with
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
county government
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass while it does
 
01:54:00.639 --> 01:54:01.669 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass while it does
cover

01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
costs for the salary it would not cover
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
costs for
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
other things that would go along with
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
the office such as miles reimbursement
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
and office space any supplies that they
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
would need a telephone a computer
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
printer things like that um and our
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
other concern is if we
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
set a salary and the fees do not come in
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
as anticipated uh the county would then
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
have to make up that difference
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh that they have
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
while county governments understand that
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
this is an important
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
issue we have been greatly impacted by
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
covet 19
 
01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
financially and adding this additional
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
burden at this time would be a challenge
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions but i
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep it short since
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%

01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%

five the registered probate proposal

now we ask that you remove part five of
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
and vote on it separately as an expedia
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
to legislate or strike it
 
01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
entirely i'm not going to reiterate a
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
lot of the
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
i did submit my own testimony i'm not
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to reiterate a lot of the
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
information that
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
speaker scitec mentioned but
 
01:55:58.229 --> 01:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to tell you a few things there
 
01:56:00.070 --> 01:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
was a representation made
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh that this is um
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
this proposal is actually
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
the counties can either opt in or opt
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
out and that is not true
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
this is an absolute the registered
 
01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:14.070 align:start position:0%
this is an absolute the registered
probate

01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
probate
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
shall have an office either in the
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds or other location
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
determined by the county
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
so it is not optional at all that's the
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
first thing um
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know i would argue as an attorney
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
and as a
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
person who was in the courthouse that
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
the registered appropriate position
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
is a court function it is not a county
 
01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:36.550 align:start position:0%
is a court function it is not a county
function

01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
members of the public who come to the
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
courthouse looking for answers
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
are looking for answers at the probate
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
court they're not looking to be either
 
01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:45.669 align:start position:0%
court they're not looking to be either
given

01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
a business card or toll to go elsewhere
 
01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:48.790 align:start position:0%
a business card or toll to go elsewhere
to

01:56:48.790 --> 01:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
access information or assistance from a
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
registered probate
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know you we have already housed very
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
well versed staff at the court
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
the 10th circuit actually has a health
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
center that has been closed for years
 
01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
and that help center used to be the
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
facility where the public could come
 
01:57:12.629 --> 01:57:12.639 align:start position:0%
and a staff member would sit with them
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
and fill out documentation
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
so they did not have to use an attorney
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
so i mean
 
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
obviously the court got rid of that for
 
01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
whatever reason we all know that they're
 
01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.310 align:start position:0%
whatever reason we all know that they're
understaffed

01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
understaffed
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
but you know the concern is if i'm going
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
for probate matters i want to go to the
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
probate court
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
i don't want to search out someplace
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
else nor should i have to
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
um the issue with the 20 additional fee
 
01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
um i recently filed a probate it was
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
a 250 dollar filing not 175
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
and that fee will still be in place and
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
on top of that an additional 20 dollar
 
01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:51.510 align:start position:0%
on top of that an additional 20 dollar
fee

01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
fee
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
unrealistic to think that not knowing
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
how many people this is going to affect
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
how many people are going to be seeking
 
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
out the register of probate
 
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
to put on people's back to add another
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars to a fund
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
that only pays for salary doesn't pay
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
for any of the other responsibilities
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
as kate corgan you know noted and
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
you know basically we're talking about i
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
mean i can i can
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
assure you that i do more than um
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
fog up a mirror um which was said about
 
01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:26.470 align:start position:0%
fog up a mirror um which was said about
the

01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
qualifications of people in elected
 
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:29.830 align:start position:0%
qualifications of people in elected
positions

01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly if i i am very
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
fortunate as a
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
lot of other elected officials because
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
at our fingertips
 
01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
staff who are educated who help us
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
who guide us and that is the most
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
important thing
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
about this bill there is no
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
provision for that there's no provision
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
for education for whoever is going to be
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
the register of probate
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
to be knowledgeable and and explain to
 
01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.109 align:start position:0%
to be knowledgeable and and explain to
people

01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
the dynamics of what they need to do how
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
they need to do it
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
and in what order so you know that
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's a problem in and of itself
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
um the other thing i will tell you is i
 
01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
am unaware of
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
any elected official who doesn't appoint
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
their own deputy the county
 
01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:20.709 align:start position:0%
their own deputy the county
commissioners

01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
have absolutely no say in the registered
 
01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:25.030 align:start position:0%
have absolutely no say in the registered
deeds

01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
deeds
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
my appointment of one or two deputies
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
i am required however to go to them to
 
01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
get the person
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
bonded which has never been an issue but
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
the county commissioners
 
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
are not involved with that and i know in
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation that's that's
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
one of the proposals is that
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
the commissioners are going to get
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
involved in appointing a
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
deputy you know why or how they're going
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
to figure out qualifications i really
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:59:52.229 --> 01:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i'll point out is
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
this proposal uh references that the
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
registered probate salary
 
01:59:58.669 --> 01:59:58.679 align:start position:0%
um is going to be consistent with rsa
 
01:59:58.679 --> 02:00:00.470 align:start position:0%
um is going to be consistent with rsa
548-17

02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
548-17
 
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
that irsa says that the salary will be
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
100 dollars period
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
and then we go on later on this bill and
 
02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:10.390 align:start position:0%
and then we go on later on this bill and
in

02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
in we're suggesting that the county
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
delegation now is going to be setting
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
the salary so
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit of inconsistency there um
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
but you know all i would all i would say
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
and all i would ask
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
you to do is really take a look at this
 
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know what the need is
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
that is is being
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
um proposed or being said is out there
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done but if there if
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
there is a need out there for the public
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
it falls upon the judiciary and it's the
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
judiciary who needs to staff their
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
offices and help the public that's why
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
we pay
 
02:00:46.070 --> 02:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
fees to these offices
 
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's why people pay fees to my office
 
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
we and by the way the fees associated
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
with my office have to do with
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
my relationship with department of
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
revenue because obviously
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
um we collect all the yell chip and the
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
transfer tax
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
but on top of that the recording fees
 
02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:05.430 align:start position:0%
but on top of that the recording fees
basically

02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
um are used to help with the archival
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
um keeping of the records which is
 
02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
substantial which is substantial
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
so you know in closing i would just you
 
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
know point out that
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
the counties are in opposition to this
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
bill and we
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
would appreciate your consideration
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for ms stacy who
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
joins us here this afternoon we are
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
sb 89 representative barry
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you um stacey for taking
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
um you said in your closing argument
 
02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:45.270 align:start position:0%
um you said in your closing argument
there

02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
um basically you allude to the people's
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
attempt to seek
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
redress right if they have a problem
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
with the current probate
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
they have to go to the judiciary and
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
this is one of my issues
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
with the current system the judiciary by
 
02:01:58.400 --> 02:01:59.270 align:start position:0%
with the current system the judiciary by
design

02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
design
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
is to be insulated from the political
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
will of people
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
it is supposed to be by design
 
02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:06.390 align:start position:0%
it is supposed to be by design
independent

02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
independent
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
how so if a person is having an issue
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
with this body
 
02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
how do they currently seek redress with
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
a body that is literally designed to not
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
be moved
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
versus if it goes back to the power of
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
people or accounting or elected office
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
we can hold that person accountable if
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
you don't do your jobs register of deeds
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
the good people of rockman county cannot
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
elect you but you do your job well so
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
they continue to elect you
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
so how do you reconcile that how do they
 
02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
actually redress
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
when they really have no option because
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's currently being managed by a branch
 
02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
of government
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
that is designed to not be moved well i
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
disagree with that
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
i i honestly believe that your position
 
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
is the answer to that
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
if you have members of the public for
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
your constituents who are having issues
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
with the judiciary
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
they come to you and ask you to put
 
02:02:54.790 --> 02:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
through a piece of legislation
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
ask you to fund them you know all those
 
02:02:58.709 --> 02:02:58.719 align:start position:0%
type of things through the budget well
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
however it has to be
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously you know even in this
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill there is an
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
option here to get rid of the registered
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
probate if they're not fulfilling the
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
functions of their position just like
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
there is for me and it isn't
 
02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
has has nothing to do with an election
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
but the issue here is the judiciary and
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
the only people who can change that
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative barry follow up to my
 
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
last question to your point
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
mr stacy isn't that what this
 
02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
isn't that us doing our job right now i
 
02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:34.149 align:start position:0%
isn't that us doing our job right now i
disagree

02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
i think that you have a court function
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
that needs to remain in the court
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
it is not a county function it belongs
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
in the court
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
that office belongs to it needs to be
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
located within that court
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
not not the county not at some other
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
location where the people aren't going
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
to find it
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
because all i could think of quite
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
honestly is if i'm a member of the
 
02:03:54.719 --> 02:03:55.350 align:start position:0%

years you have any insight as to how
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
well the
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
current situation has worked with the
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
clerk of court replacing the registered
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
what i will say is this my office
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
fields a lot of questions from members
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
of the public because they don't get
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
their answers upstairs they come down to
 
02:05:06.550 --> 02:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
the registry of deeds
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
looking for help and guidance and and my
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
staff and i can't
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
help them um obviously we had clerks
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
that were there who were well-versed
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
they were upstairs in the court so that
 
02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
when people came they could ask them
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
questions and they got their questions
 
02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:20.550 align:start position:0%
questions and they got their questions
answered

02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
answered
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
on site there at the clerk's office that
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
isn't happening as much now
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
and obviously now with culvert it's not
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%

hb89

02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
hb89
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
good so uh many of the prior speakers
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
have covered many of the positions
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
that i was going to address but i was
 
02:07:01.109 --> 02:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
the register of probate when the
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
position was eliminated
 
02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
and one of the one of the unfortunate
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
results of that position being away
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
is there's no long advocate for those
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
people who are coming to the court who
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
need assistance
 
02:07:19.109 --> 02:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
but i had a professional staff and
 
02:07:19.119 --> 02:07:19.750 align:start position:0%
but i had a professional staff and
together

02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
we could provide services as kathy stacy
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
said there used to be a help desk to
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
assist people many of the public
 
02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
um their ability to read
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
and understand the forms how to fill out
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
the forms
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's a problem but if if you
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
don't have a professional staff to work
 
02:07:42.079 --> 02:07:42.629 align:start position:0%
don't have a professional staff to work
with

02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:07:46.470 --> 02:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
it isn't going to be feasible to have
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
somebody sitting in some other office
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
who cannot provide legal advice
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
and may or may not know anything about
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
the probate process the court has an
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
entire staff available
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
to assist the public and any public
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
agency whether it's the
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
whether it's the court system whether
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's the dmv whether it's the registry
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
of deeds
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's the governor's office their
 
02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:11.750 align:start position:0%
whether it's the governor's office their
role

02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
role
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
is service to the public and the
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
judicial branch should provide
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
at the minimum a help desk and eliminate
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
i i have uh heard complain
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
about the emailing everything has to be
 
02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
filed in concord you cannot go to the
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
local probate court
 
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
and hand them a piece of paper it has to
 
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
be in through the e-filing system
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
and that requires the attorneys because
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
not user-friendly system you know if you
 
02:08:41.669 --> 02:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
help the public reform the whole
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
process of how you work through the
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
probate system
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
let them record that paper in this
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
legislation it says the index
 
02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
is going to be uh with this person
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
and the index needs to be in the court
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
because the court system has to be able
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
to find records
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
and the index is the only place they can
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
go to
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to find records um
 
02:09:13.589 --> 02:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
the archives are at the state archives
 
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
they're turning to dust in in a lot of
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
cases because very few of the records of
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
the probate court have been digitized
 
02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
i think that's a far more important um
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
far more to determine get done
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
miss tilton if you could speak up we do
 
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
seem to have a bad connection i don't
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
know whether other
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
members are having a hard time hearing
 
02:09:49.589 --> 02:09:49.599 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing some nods
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
so just please speak up thank you
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay um so in any case
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
the deputy register pay i don't know why
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
the county would be responsible for that
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if it says your payment
 
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
to the counties would be limited to the
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
other funds are available
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
um so it is not enough revenue
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
coming in through the recording fees the
 
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
county would be on the hook for these

02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
county register of probate
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
um and i would like to speak in
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh favor of this bill i have been in
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
touch with
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
eight other registers who are also
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
looking uh forward to what this bill
 
02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:47.669 align:start position:0%
looking uh forward to what this bill
could

02:11:47.669 --> 02:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
provide for their constituents
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
i sent some uh written testimony so i i
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
won't go through at all um
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
but there are two major problems with
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
what happened in 2011
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
which reduced not only the duties of the
 
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.109 align:start position:0%
which reduced not only the duties of the
probate

02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
probate
 
02:12:10.149 --> 02:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
register but reduce the probate court
 
02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
to non-existent i mean it is now a
 
02:12:13.589 --> 02:12:13.599 align:start position:0%
probate division
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
underneath uh the circuit court um
 
02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
and um a a court that
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
had a staff of around 53 uh people
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
um by my 2017 had about
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
nine people across the state um
 
02:12:33.669 --> 02:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
and so the the first problem i see
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
is in the keeping of the historic record
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
when they talk about the historic
 
02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:40.550 align:start position:0%
when they talk about the historic
documents

02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
documents
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
it the registry of deeds and the
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
registry probate
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
go hand in hand to prove all the
 
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
ownership of property
 
02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
in all the counties it's a very
 
02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
important record
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
and it has it
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
really deserves a better oversight the
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
second problem i see
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
is certainly a customer service issue
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
though here in new hampshire we have
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
what we
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
term supervised probate which is a
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
little more difficult than
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
say our neighbors in maine that have
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
unsupervised probate
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
it is a little it's more difficult and
 
02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:18.470 align:start position:0%
it is a little it's more difficult and
um

02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
and the folks who have to use it
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
um could use all the help they could get
 
02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
um large estates usually have attorneys
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
that help
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
its uh the smaller estates that people
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
do on their own that could really use
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
the help and
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
used to get the help but they no longer
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
they no longer do um
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
i was also the uh manager of the
 
02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:48.629 align:start position:0%
i was also the uh manager of the
information

02:13:48.629 --> 02:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
center the creator and manager of the
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
information center
 
02:13:55.270 --> 02:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
for the circuit court and we did try
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
very hard to
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
train people to be able to answer the
 
02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:02.790 align:start position:0%
train people to be able to answer the
questions

02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the probate court but there's a
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between
 
02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between
district

02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
court issues and and
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
probate issues you know probate is all
 
02:14:20.229 --> 02:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
civil um people come to the probate use
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
the probate
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
procedures um when their family is in
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
some sort of crisis
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
they've lost a loved one or they need a
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
loved one to
 
02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
come under go under guardianship and all
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
of those
 
02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
are are sensitive issues and
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
now if you have a probate issue and you
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
can't handle the computer and you go to
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
the courthouse the circuit court
 
02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
house you you go to the window and they
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
say oh there's a kiosk computer over
 
02:14:50.639 --> 02:14:51.189 align:start position:0%
say oh there's a kiosk computer over
there

02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the lobby that you can use
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
um to file your case and oh yes there's
 
02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599 align:start position:0%
a binder there that'll give you some
 
02:14:59.599 --> 02:15:00.470 align:start position:0%
a binder there that'll give you some
information

02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
and there's a telephone if you have more
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
information call the 855 number
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
and they'll help you and that's about
 
02:15:08.550 --> 02:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
all you get
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
if you're going if you're going
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
um to get help at the courthouse
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
um so this bill is i think an attempt
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
um to help the difficulties
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
to to throw the throw
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
some little help to the to the
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
constituents who
 
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
who need it at their times of crisis
 
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
um the training issue that's been
 
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
brought up is a critical issue i
 
02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
i agree with it um uh
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i and i did try and talk with the
 
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
court about that
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about this um this
 
02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:48.629 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about this um this
bill

02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
and they um would didn't want to
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
provide any um and um
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that i think that we
 
02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
we would work on that as registers
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
i certainly have 20 plus years
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
of experience in the probate court and
 
02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:09.830 align:start position:0%
of experience in the probate court and
would

02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
certainly be willing to be of assistance
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think having the register of probate
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
in fact i've talked to people who've
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
looked on the county
 
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh website um looking for probate
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
and i think for the register of probate
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
to be on the county website
 
02:16:34.150 --> 02:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
would be a a good thing for
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
them to be able to find us and us to be
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
able to help
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
when senator gray was talking about a
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
case that
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
that he knew that somebody had had
 
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
that had an attorney that helped them
 
02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:00.469 align:start position:0%
that had an attorney that helped them
they

02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
only had to transfer a car well
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
i think that if they had talked to the
 
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
registered probate they would know that
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
they could just go to the
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
department of the registry to
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
change a private car ownership
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
of one private car without
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
even going to the probate court so
 
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's an example of
 
02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
what kind of help the probate register
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
could do
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
um if they you know if they have
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
a better profile um out in the public
 
02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
and certainly they would deserve to be
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
paid more than a hundred dollars a year
 
02:17:41.359 --> 02:17:42.070 align:start position:0%
paid more than a hundred dollars a year
um

02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
for the work that they do and for uh
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
the training that they would have to
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
get to um to be able to do the job
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
and i certainly am willing to take any
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions anyone has
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much ms bradstreet is
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%

02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
bradstreet who appears before us
 
02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
right you're muted okay
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you ms
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
bradstreet for taking my question
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
so how could you help the citizens if
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:29.830 --> 02:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
well we i had hoped that we would be
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
able to get
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
access to the the the database
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know all all of the estate um
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
records now are are electronic
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
um you don't file any paper anymore
 
02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
they're all electronic
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
and it's all done in concord which is
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons the
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
the county court houses don't have any
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
information because
 
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
everything's done in in concord
 
02:18:59.509 --> 02:18:59.519 align:start position:0%
but i think you can
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
the register can pick up the phone and
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
call the 855 number and
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
know the questions to ask and to get the
 
02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
information that the person's looking
 
02:19:08.479 --> 02:19:11.830 align:start position:0%
information that the person's looking
for

02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
further questions from anybody from this
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
broad street the
 
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
oh well uh yes i thought i
 
02:19:24.629 --> 02:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
had heard that the all the records are
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
not digitized yet
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
oh they they are not
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
they are not you would have to go at um
 
02:19:32.479 --> 02:19:32.950 align:start position:0%
they are not you would have to go at um
i

02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
i was the one that suggested that the
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
the number of years be increased to
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
40 years that are of of paper
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
goes back 40 years at the courthouse but
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
you know i i
 
02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
forget exactly 2016 perhaps
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
maybe it was 15 that the states started
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
all going
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
electronically so there won't
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know eventually here there's not
 
02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to be paper there but
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
40 years is about as far back as the the
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
title searchers like to get to be able
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
to give someone a warranty deed
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
um sometimes there are unique situations
 
02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:10.309 align:start position:0%
um sometimes there are unique situations
but

02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
um the register ought to be able to
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
go into the courthouse and look at the
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
look at the paper files
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
they um that's one thing that
 
02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
the register hasn't been even allowed in
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
the job that they have right now they're
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
not allowed to do because the court has
 
02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
not is not cooperative with them
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative to rosian is that you i

02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh so today under the uh living under
 
02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:56.630 align:start position:0%
uh so today under the uh living under
the

02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
don uh from the change that was adopted
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
in 2011
 
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
to transfer basically all the activity
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
to circuit court
 
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
what is your job description as a
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
registered probate
 
02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
well just what they've just what they've
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
in the bill as the keeper of
 
02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
of any possible historic records
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
um to oversee it
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
with supervision from the administrative
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
judge of the circuit court
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
which is unusual for an elected official
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
to be supervised by an appointed
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
official but that's what the description
 
02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
has been
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
and however we haven't really been
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh we haven't been allowed in the in the
 
02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:46.550 align:start position:0%
uh we haven't been allowed in the in the
courthouses

02:21:46.550 --> 02:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
courthouses
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up question madam chair i'll
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative
 
02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks again for the
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
propose legislation
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
i would that um better serve
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
well i think they get a they get an
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
advocate that knows the system
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
and um and can can help them
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
negotiate their way through it by
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
knowing the
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
process and the procedures um
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
that they that they need to use to be
 
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
able to more efficiently use the court
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
and and get what they need and and have
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
somebody there
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
who's willing to be helpful i i
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
said before that the
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh the atmosphere of a district court is
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
very different than the atmosphere the
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
probate court used to be
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
and i think the circuit court has taken
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere of the district court
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
because the district court
 
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
is the 800 pound gorilla in the middle
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the table
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
because they it is the a huge bulk of
 
02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
the court's
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
work and civil
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
cases are
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
that are in the probate court are much
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
more family
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
related issues
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
they're just a process people have to go
 
02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
to to get the documents they need
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to process a person's estate
 
02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:19.510 align:start position:0%
to be able to process a person's estate
or

02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh handle an incapacitated
 
02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:23.590 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh handle an incapacitated
relative

02:23:23.590 --> 02:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
relative
 
02:23:26.710 --> 02:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
so um it's a it's
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's a different it's a different
 
02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:31.190 align:start position:0%
it's a different it's a different
culture

02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
culture
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
further questions for miss bradstreet
 
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative derozan did you have a
 
02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:35.510 align:start position:0%
representative derozan did you have a
follow-up

02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair i went one
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
last follow-up
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
um so if this legislation would become
 
02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:44.830 align:start position:0%
um so if this legislation would become
law

02:23:44.830 --> 02:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:23:47.429 --> 02:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
um do you think it would speed up the
 
02:23:47.439 --> 02:23:48.150 align:start position:0%
um do you think it would speed up the
process

02:23:48.150 --> 02:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
of people going through the probate
 
02:23:55.270 --> 02:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
from how it's currently done there are
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
there are certain time frames that are
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
important in probate
 
02:24:02.550 --> 02:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
that you can't necessarily speed up um
 
02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:03.830 align:start position:0%
that you can't necessarily speed up um
but

02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
i think it would i think it would help
 
02:24:06.319 --> 02:24:07.030 align:start position:0%
i think it would i think it would help
um

02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
our our constituents um get what they
 
02:24:10.399 --> 02:24:11.030 align:start position:0%
our our constituents um get what they
need

02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
and uh without a lot of um
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
difficulty and it certainly would make
 
02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
the whole experience a better experience
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
for those folks who but through no fault
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
of their own
 
02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
um have had to have to deal with the
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
with the court system thank you
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%

02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%

02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
dan healy um mr healey
 
02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for joining us um
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
and did you have want to speak to
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
each s espy 89
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
yes derry town clerk
 
02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
um i spoke on this bill when it was in
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
02:25:10.710 --> 02:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
um my concern on this is part three
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
number two the opening of absentee
 
02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
ballot outer envelopes
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
i had suggested that it be an
 
02:25:21.030 --> 02:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
option for town and city clerks to
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
change the shell to a may
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think this bill takes into
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
account the larger town
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
the day before the general election we
 
02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:30.790 align:start position:0%
the day before the general election we
had

02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:25:33.750 --> 02:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
around 500 absentee ballots returned to
 
02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
us either done
 
02:25:38.309 --> 02:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
in the lobby or coming through the mail
 
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
now it's saying that we would have to
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
then open up all those envelopes
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
the day before and verify the signatures
 
02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
are there verify that they did develop
 
02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:49.670 align:start position:0%
are there verify that they did develop
correctly

02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
we did pre-processing we pre-processed
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
between four to five thousand ballots i
 
02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:54.469 align:start position:0%
between four to five thousand ballots i
think

02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
the pre-processing is a is a great
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
option and it does catch a lot of those
 
02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:01.190 align:start position:0%
option and it does catch a lot of those
things

02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
the closer you get to the election day
 
02:26:06.389 --> 02:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
the clerks just don't in bigger towns we
 
02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
just don't really have the time to
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
to do this additional step uh if we had
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
to open 500
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
ballots the day before i don't know how
 
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
long we would be in the office
 
02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
and we still have to set up the polling
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
place my other concern with that
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
that section is the security of those
 
02:26:26.070 --> 02:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
open ballots now
 
02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this bill that says
 
02:26:30.469 --> 02:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
what we do with that box of
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
ballots that have the outer envelope now
 
02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:34.230 align:start position:0%
ballots that have the outer envelope now
opened

02:26:34.230 --> 02:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
opened
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
so i i think it needs some work on just
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
that section
 
02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
and it really ultimately is the
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
moderator that verifies the absentee
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
ballots i know my moderator has some
 
02:26:46.469 --> 02:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
concerns on that uh she
 
02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
had told me that she submitted written
 
02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:49.910 align:start position:0%
had told me that she submitted written
testimony

02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i believe it addresses that concern
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
that it it's the moderators
 
02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:54.870 align:start position:0%
that it it's the moderators
responsibility

02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
not the clerk and just the time
 
02:26:59.190 --> 02:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
constraints on it for for the larger
 
02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:00.150 align:start position:0%
constraints on it for for the larger
talents

02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
talents
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think smaller towns might be able to
 
02:27:03.510 --> 02:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
they get say 50 ballots back that day
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
they might be able to go through them
 
02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
but if you're talking
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
you know nashua derry manchester the the
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
larger towns
 
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh we we would have an issue going
 
02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:16.710 align:start position:0%
uh we we would have an issue going
through

02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
500 ballots a day before the election
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
and contacting all those people um and
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
that ends uh my testimony i'd be open to
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:27:27.510 --> 02:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody have any
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
questions for mr
 
02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
i have a question manager representative
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you mr
 
02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
healey for taking the question
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
um pre-prove it uh when
 
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
you had to come or do all the processing
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
on election day was that a problem for
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
your talent did that work out okay that
 
02:27:47.439 --> 02:27:48.630 align:start position:0%
your talent did that work out okay that
way

02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
pre-kobit we had uh no problem going
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
through the absentee ballots
 
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
um compared to 2016
 
02:27:58.630 --> 02:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
i believe our numbers for absentee for
 
02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
the general election were about 1200
 
02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:01.510 align:start position:0%
the general election were about 1200
ballots

02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh this year uh we were closer to 7 000.
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
so there was a quite a big difference i
 
02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
do think the absentee ballots with the
 
02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:12.309 align:start position:0%
do think the absentee ballots with the
pre-processing

02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
pre-processing
 
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
and depending on if um some of the laws
 
02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:15.590 align:start position:0%
and depending on if um some of the laws
on

02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
who can request an absentee ballot
 
02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
change to to make it a little more open
 
02:28:21.910 --> 02:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
we'd see probably in between the the
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred to seven thousand so
 
02:28:25.590 --> 02:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
probably in that three to four thousand
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
range i'm assuming thank you very much
 
02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
asking i just lost somebody
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
where did they go um
 
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
margaret brines would like to speak in
 
02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:53.600 align:start position:0%

02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
02:29:06.790 --> 02:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
um briefly i'm margaret burns i'm the
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
executive director of the new hampshire
 
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
municipal association and we are here to
 
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
express our support
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
for part three of senate bill 89 we do
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
not have any position on
 
02:29:21.429 --> 02:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
any of the other sections generally we
 
02:29:21.439 --> 02:29:22.469 align:start position:0%
any of the other sections generally we
support

02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
this part of senate bill 89 because it
 
02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
does provide
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
some efficiency for municipal officials
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
by allowing for a certain level of
 
02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
pre-processing to occur
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
prior to election day speeding up the
 
02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:35.590 align:start position:0%
prior to election day speeding up the
process

02:29:35.590 --> 02:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
on election day although i do recognize
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
dan healy's concerns expressed about it
 
02:29:42.479 --> 02:29:42.950 align:start position:0%
dan healy's concerns expressed about it
being

02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
a mandate for the opening to occur prior
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
to election day but generally
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
at nhma we have heard support for
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
some level of pre-processing to be
 
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
authorized so that the process can be
 
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
sped up
 
02:29:59.349 --> 02:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
on election day we do have one
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
suggested amendment to the bill which i
 
02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:03.510 align:start position:0%
suggested amendment to the bill which i
believe

02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
has been conveyed to senator gray as
 
02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:07.670 align:start position:0%
has been conveyed to senator gray as
well

02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
on page three of the bill lines
 
02:30:15.030 --> 02:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
21 through 23
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill right now says
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
that the moderator
 
02:30:21.750 --> 02:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
shall mark the checklist so this is
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
the processing that is now that is
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
occurring on election day it says the
 
02:30:29.270 --> 02:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
moderator shall mark the checklist
 
02:30:31.349 --> 02:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
but we would recommend that the language
 
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
be changed to
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
the moderator or the moderators designee
 
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
and the reason for this is that because
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
in in practice it's not the moderator
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
marking the checklist it's the moderator
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
opening the inner
 
02:30:47.910 --> 02:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
envelope announcing the name waiting for
 
02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
the challenge and
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
a ballot clerk is usually there with the
 
02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:52.790 align:start position:0%
a ballot clerk is usually there with the
checklist

02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
actually making the marks on the
 
02:30:56.469 --> 02:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
checklist so we
 
02:30:58.150 --> 02:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
would suggest that the language be
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
altered so that the moderator can
 
02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
designate someone
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
usually a ballot clerk to be the one
 
02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:04.710 align:start position:0%
usually a ballot clerk to be the one
making

02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
making
 
02:31:06.870 --> 02:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
the mark on the checklist on election
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
day so
 
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony i'm happy to
 
02:31:12.150 --> 02:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for ms burns
 
02:31:15.359 --> 02:31:15.670 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for ms burns
from

02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:22.150 align:start position:0%
from
nhma

02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you um
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
also with us on um
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
this issue is deputy scanlon
 
02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlon did you want to comment
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
on hb-89
 
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh once again
 
02:31:44.070 --> 02:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm david scanlan deputy secretary of
 
02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:45.110 align:start position:0%
i'm david scanlan deputy secretary of
state

02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
and i'll be brief because i know i'm
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
probably the one that's standing between
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
the committee at lunch
 
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
and uh we don't want that so um
 
02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to comment on part three
 
02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
um you know i i agree
 
02:31:58.950 --> 02:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
with uh the comments made by dan healey
 
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
and margaret burns
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
um you know i will say that the
 
02:32:04.710 --> 02:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
experience that we had
 
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 state elections uh relative
 
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
to the pre-processing of
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots was was very favorable
 
02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:14.469 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots was was very favorable
and

02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
i think the the moderators in particular
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
found it to be a useful tool
 
02:32:21.190 --> 02:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
in being able to efficiently process
 
02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
their absentee ballots
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the one thing that's missing
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
in this language is
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
is the procedure
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
that took place in 2020 and that is
 
02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:33.590 align:start position:0%
that took place in 2020 and that is
specifically

02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:32:35.910 --> 02:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
allowing the pre-processing to take
 
02:32:39.190 --> 02:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
place on the thursday friday saturday
 
02:32:42.389 --> 02:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
and monday prior to the election at the
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
discretion of
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
the moderator the other important
 
02:32:50.469 --> 02:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh event that we found in this process
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
was the ability of
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
the clerks to contact the voters to have
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
them cure
 
02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
deficiencies on the affidavit form
 
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
allowing those voters
 
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
to actually have their vote count by
 
02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
being contacted
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
and coming in to uh you know to correct
 
02:33:08.399 --> 02:33:08.870 align:start position:0%
and coming in to uh you know to correct
the

02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:33:10.389 --> 02:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
the issue whether it was a signature
 
02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
that was required
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
or some other thing and you know i think
 
02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
that it's important that that be allowed
 
02:33:18.389 --> 02:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
to continue
 
02:33:20.309 --> 02:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
if it is done it should be uniform
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
all towns should have to follow through
 
02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:33:27.590 --> 02:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
um but to the extent that the voters are
 
02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
willing to provide the contact
 
02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:30.710 align:start position:0%
willing to provide the contact
information

02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
on their application and that is either
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
providing a phone number
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
or a an email so that they can be
 
02:33:37.439 --> 02:33:39.349 align:start position:0%
or a an email so that they can be
contacted

02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
contacted
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
um the other uh section of bill that i
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to address was
 
02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
part four um and that's dealing with
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
the audit after an election
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
and potential investigations
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
i know that this committee has has
 
02:33:57.680 --> 02:33:59.510 align:start position:0%
i know that this committee has has
re-referred

02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
re-referred
 
02:34:01.590 --> 02:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
other bills dealing with the same
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
subject matter and i would suggest that
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
that this topic be studied along with
 
02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
those other
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
items um you know the first part of this
 
02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
calls for study committee but the
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
the later parts of it call for processes
 
02:34:19.270 --> 02:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
that would lead to investigations
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
authorized by the bylaw commission or
 
02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
02:34:27.270 --> 02:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
i think we have to be very careful here
 
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of the processes that we might
 
02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
put in place after an election
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important that we
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
have processes in place
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
that lead to accurate counts um both
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
at the local level and at the recount
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
and a process to audit the devices that
 
02:34:46.309 --> 02:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
are used to count the ballots
 
02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh because um
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
at some point we need to achieve
 
02:34:54.790 --> 02:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
finality in elections that's just a
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
a really important component of the
 
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
election process
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
and not have uh questions
 
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
and not have uh elections questioned
 
02:35:09.110 --> 02:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
ongoing after the fact and and after
 
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
the the count the recount and appeal
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
process have been completed
 
02:35:16.950 --> 02:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that there's a door open in
 
02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
this language to continue that
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
into the future um and
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know i think that that has to be
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
careful carefully thought out and
 
02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:26.389 align:start position:0%
careful carefully thought out and
reviewed

02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
and understood before we create a
 
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
process like that
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
and i'll in there madam chair be happy
 
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
to answer questions uh
 
02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
on the bill um otherwise i'm ready for
 
02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
launch too
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
members for deputy scanlon
 
02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:50.469 --> 02:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
again madam chairman thank you deputy in
 
02:35:53.429 --> 02:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
regard to section 3 uh deputy
 
02:35:56.710 --> 02:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
regard to pre-processing uh i'll ask you
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
the same question i asked the
 
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor um does the
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
secretary of state talk 70 data on on
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
percentage or numbers statewide of uh
 
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots where you know
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
signatures or
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
incorrect uh name were on the inner
