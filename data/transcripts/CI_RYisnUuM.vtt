law enforcement these are men and women
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
and individuals who said I want to
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
protect my community in one way or the
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
other and there's a variety of different
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
ways to serve in law enforcement but
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
every single one of these individuals
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
does their does it of their own valtion
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%

00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:27.799 align:start position:0%
do to make everybody's else's lives
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
safer and that takes commitment and it
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
takes sacrifice and as we me have
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned and we'll continue to mention
 
00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
not just sacrifice of those individuals
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
but of those families who also carry
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
that every single
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
day so this year we're we pay tribute to
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
uh once again 55 55 individuals in their
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
families and I guess it is a blessing to
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
say that this year is one of the few
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
years thank God that we are not adding
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
any new names to the memorial it should
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
bring us all an incredible amount
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
um of Pride to know that our law
 
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement is out there every day
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
devoted to protecting and serving our
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
communities and they they truly are the
 
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
best in the
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
nation as we have much to pray um and
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
plan on let's understand first and
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
foremost no state is immune as amazing
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
as these individuals are no state is
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
immune from tragedy can strike anywhere
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
at any time uh you can pass all the laws
 
00:23:26.269 --> 00:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
in the world put all the bubble wrap
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
around the system that you want but at
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
the end end of the day tragedy can
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
strike in a lot of different forms in a
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
lot of different
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
ways what constantly reassures me and
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
what allows all of us I think to sleep
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
well at night is knowing that when
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
tragedy might strike our communities our
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers run into the
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
danger without hesitation only thinking
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
of the job at hand in speaking with them
 
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
often after such events you hear that
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing on their mind in those
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
moments was the safety of others they
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't come to you and say well the first
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
thing I thought of is what do I have to
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
do to Duck and Cover that's not what you
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
hear ever literally ever it's always
 
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
about how do we get in there how do we
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
provide provide protection to those that
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
are that are under
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
harm that unflinching response is
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
because they know that the safeties of
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
others truly depends on them hearing
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
those stories it makes you want to step
 
00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559 align:start position:0%
back and really see the bigger picture
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
and it does it reminds us I think all of
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
what is truly important making sure our
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
priorities are straight and we often
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
gather right here in conquer to tout new
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
successes and we have a lot to be proud
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
of we could be here all day talking
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
about that but if there's one thing that
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
I've learned to be true it's no matter
 
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
again what policies are passed in these
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
buildings no matter what the debate is
 
00:24:42.029 --> 00:24:42.039 align:start position:0%
that may play out in these halls or the
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
coverage that you see on TV it is the
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
people on the front lines that really
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
matter New Hampshire is proudly the
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
number one state for Public Safety and
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
proudly ranked as one of the best states
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh in the country to live in number one
 
00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
overall in the east as we like to to
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
brag about and but that is all thanks to
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
work done by our our law enforcement
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
each and every member of our law
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement is gathered here today and
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
being represented and every single name
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
that adorns this Memorial here is an
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
individual to thank those of you who
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
attend this ceremony each year know that
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
I always remind everyone that just as
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
the sacrifice made by these officers is
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
not just it's not just one day this
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
isn't just a one day memorial event it
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
is really something that I truly believe
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
I think we all believe we need to carry
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
with us 365 days a year right and when
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
again I kind of look at the the kids
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
here I have my own kids a lot of you are
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
here with your families representing
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
your families maybe you've lost a loved
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
one maybe you're just coming out of the
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
office to to gather with us today at the
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
memorial but it's about carrying that
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
that understanding of that sacrifice and
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
what that means to all of these families
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%
and carrying that with us day in and day
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
out instilling something new with our
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
kids the lessons to be learned the honor
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
the pride that it is to serve um and the
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity it is to do something
 
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
for your community something that can
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
leave a a truly indel indelible Mark and
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
strengthens our communities not because
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
of politicians and not because of
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
policies they're always strengthened by
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
the individuals that are standing up and
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
making a difference and it's no easy
 
00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:15.799 align:start position:0%
burden the state of New Hampshire is
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
proud to stand with all these families
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
and we obviously thank you for your
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
courage your sacrifice um continuing to
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
carry that burden New Hampshire is many
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
things but first and foremost we are
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
just that neighbors and community that
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
is truly how we Define ourselves Live
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
Free or Die it's about the individual
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's not about a big system and to have
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
individual standing up for each other
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
any given day under any circumstance no
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
matter what that tragedy may bring um
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's in in the good weather or bad
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
they're always there for us and it
 
00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
really is something that allows us I
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
think a lot of Solace to sleep on so as
 
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
I Look To The Future my time in office
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
does grow shorter um I think the focus
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
always has to be on ensuring the
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
successes that we've made aren't just
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
temporary right they have to be long
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
lasting we want them to to truly take
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%

the sacrifice these officers and their
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
families have made today is the one day
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
of the year where we invite the public

enforcement officers who died in the
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
line of duty we must also reflect on the
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
contributions of all our living law
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%

enforcement memorial wall on this day I
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
would also like to take a moment to
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
recognize someone who was instrumental
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
in the creation of this beautiful
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
monument that stands behind me
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 years ago the original
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers Memorial
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
committee was working very hard in an
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
effort to raise adequate funds to create
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
a permanent Memorial to honor our fallen
 
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
heroes when they finally achieved their
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
fundraising goals they asked a Committee
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
Member at the time a man by the name of
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
Van McLoud a former director of the
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%

artists to submit proposals or models of
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
a concept of what this Memorial would
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
look like and to present those IDE ideas
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
to all the committee retired New
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
good friend of mine who's still on the
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
on the committee today one of the
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
original members of this committee
 
00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
shared his memories of this process
 
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
major asero stated to me that this was
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
just a room full of cops that really
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
knew very little about real art Mr
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
McLoud brought the committee four or
 
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
five proposals from various artists and
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
after a brief discussion they made the
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
decision to ask an artist by the name of
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
Emil Burch Emil's creative Spirit was
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
one of a true artist he shared his work
 
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:32.919 align:start position:0%
through the the New Hampshire State
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
Council on the Arts teaching through the
 
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480 align:start position:0%

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
for people with physical Andor emotional
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
challenges beginning in
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
1976 some of you may have heard over the
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
years what each part of this morial
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
Memorial represents to AAL the overall
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
shape is a star for a reason as ail
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
would point out to us we all wore Badges
 
00:34:59.950 --> 00:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
of various shapes and colors but to him
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
the first badge was one he felt was most
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
associated with and represents law
 
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement and that was a star the
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
flame in the center represents the
 
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
internal flame of Hope and he felt this
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
flame was also symbolic of the memory of
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement officers that would
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
be inscribed on it every law enforcement
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
agency in the state donated a badge from
 
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
their prospective departments I am told
 
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
and those badges are Buried buried in
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
the ground below the center tower under
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
the flame this Memorial was designed to
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
attract people to come inside to
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
investigate to sit down and reflect on
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
the sacrifices of each of the officers
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
inscribed on the wall and while seated
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
inside they would also be shielded a bit
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
from the hustle and bustle of the
 
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.710 align:start position:0%
from the hustle and bustle of the
outside

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
outside
 
00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:47.000 align:start position:0%

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
the construction onsite for absolutely
 
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
every step from beginning to end I am
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
told Emil would probably be mortified
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
that we're here today recognizing him
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
for designing and building this Memorial
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
he did this not for the recognition but
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
because he wanted to share his talents
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
and love for the Arts and he wanted to
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
honor our New Hampshire Heroes Emil
