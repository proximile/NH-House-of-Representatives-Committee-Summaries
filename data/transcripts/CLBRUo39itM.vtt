00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
reviewing receiving complaints about
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
services working with the agencies
 
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
involved to resolve the complaints we
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
visit children in care when we're not in
 
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
lockdown from a pandemic we do visit

children remotely as well and assist
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
them when they need it and we review and
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
monitor critical incidents that happen
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
involving children who are in state care
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%

regularly consult
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
children right now is a very busy time
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
we've been consulting and helping craft
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
legislation to serve children
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
and then the fourth role that we have is
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
providing outreach and education on
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
state systems and that includes
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
providing children and other
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
constituents with information about how
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
the state operates referring them to
 
00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.029 align:start position:0%
the state operates referring them to
services

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
assisting with system navigation
 
00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
and disseminating research findings and
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
practice standards we use the office as
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
a platform to make sure everyone is
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
informed about what children need
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
so in in our
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
2020 annual report
 
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
just to give you a sense of the workload
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
of the past year before the statute
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
changed we saw 312 individual
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
constituent complaints about children
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
receiving services or not
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
we managed
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
2183 critical incidents we reviewed and
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
those included 18 child deaths
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
we do intensive critical incident
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
summaries we did 10 of those last year
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
we did 14 individual child case reviews
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
that helped teams manage make good
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
decisions about
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
how children were being cared for we
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
have a very interesting process to
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
review system issues
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
with a science a safety science based
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
instrument that engages
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
not only looks at the system but also
 
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.270 align:start position:0%
not only looks at the system but also
engages

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
engages
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
the people who work in the system so
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
that they can solve their own
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
and there's another long list of other
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
things that we do i don't want to take
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
too much time on that but i'm happy to
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
answer questions about it so looking
 
00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.110 align:start position:0%
answer questions about it so looking
forward

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
to the next biennium
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
we're already seeing um a great growth
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
in in our role as people start to
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
understand our oversight and where we're
 
00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.070 align:start position:0%
understand our oversight and where we're
helpful

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
um the currency of the office of the
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
child advocate is access to information
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
so when we're brought in to um help with
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
system questions um and create whether
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's creating new programs or evaluating
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
existing ones
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
we're able to have a very special view
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
of things because we have this access to
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
information about children all of their
 
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.350 align:start position:0%
information about children all of their
records

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
and be able to find out how kids are
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
doing in the system
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
and that's really informative and we're
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
able to keep things confidential but
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
also inform the process so
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
we've been very very busy we were hit
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
hard by the covid pandemic this year in
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
terms of staff availability off and on
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
and we've still been a mighty little
 
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
agency getting a lot accomplished
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
so we you have before you
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget which
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
is 670 thousand dollars in the first
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
year and 691 in the second um we have
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
outlined priorities um that were in our
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
original um submission and also a couple
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
of things we've rediscovered since then
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
so that our budget that we're asking for
 
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.390 align:start position:0%
so that our budget that we're asking for
is

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
between 816 and 854 in the first year
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
and 862
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
in the second year
 
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
and why there's a range is that we
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
discovered a new need in terms of
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
a case management system and database
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
that we haven't purchased so we don't
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
have the final cost of that
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
but we're looking at a couple of
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
different systems so that may change
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
over there so i'm going to stop there
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
and take questions if you have questions
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
about individual items or if you want me
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
to explain a bit more about the
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
difference between the governor's budget
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
and our requested budget
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
i think i would i would make a comment
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
about the case management software
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
so i would i would suggest you touch
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
base with i
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
i t
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
because in their presentation
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
they said that they have
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of requests for case management
 
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
and that they're actually using
 
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.790 align:start position:0%
and that they're actually using
salesforce.com

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
salesforce.com
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
which can be easily modified apparently
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
i i i'm telling you what he said i i
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
have no knowledge myself but you might
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
want to check because it could be a less
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
expensive way to get to the case
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
management solution yes thank you thank
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
you for that um and just to clarify
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
when this office opened up in 2018
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
we worked with doit were really generous
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
with us
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
in providing for free for three years um
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
the sales force platform we were
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
actually the pilot for it
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
and and what happened was because you're
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
when you're the pilot of a very large
 
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.710 align:start position:0%
when you're the pilot of a very large
enterprise

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
enterprise
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
um you you
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
you you get what you get um and so we
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
were grateful for that
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
but what's happened is because it's such
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
a large enterprise everyone moved on to
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
the bigger agencies and we're so small
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
um so we haven't we went for two years
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
trying to make changes because in
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
addition to the to the to this the
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
software being new they also were
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
rolling out how to roll it out you know
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
they were the sort of technical pieces
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
of it and so when they when they rolled
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
out our system um it went really fast
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
and it didn't correct so we ended up
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
with a system that's not all that
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
useless it's very good for
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
um holding case documents and um and
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
keeping track of things
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a very um robust
 
00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:52.150 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a very um robust
reporting

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
ability out of it which is what we need
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
in order to inform people like you
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
um and so we had for two years running
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
requests to make changes so that it
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
would be a more workable um system
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
and that was delayed delayed and then of
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
course the pandemic happened
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
and and i have nothing bad to say about
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
doit i think that they were heroes of
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
the pandemic they really stepped up and
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and made this this state operate um
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
but what's has it's happened is that we
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
have three-year-old um problems with our
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
system um and some of them are really
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
like ridiculous problems and others are
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
really operational problems um and we
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
are a very unique agency and the kinds
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
of information we gather is very unique
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
and and we've discovered since that
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of software packages
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
that are made specifically for offices
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
like ours
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
that are really functional in um
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
not only gathering data but also
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
prompting us and how we manage our cases
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that we keep up with them
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
and then and then holding things so that
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
we can report out on really significant
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
information that informs how the system
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
is operating um so we have
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
actually been
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
trying to discuss this with doit um and
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's to a point where they're just
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
not available because of the pandemic um
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
and but before then you know we weren't
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
really you know it's just not a priority
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
and such a huge undertaking of this
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
whole um
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
uh system-wide
 
00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:24.310 align:start position:0%
uh system-wide
is

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
expansion that they're doing with all
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
the other agencies so we thought it
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
would be most expedient so this is the
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
third year so now we start to pay for
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
the sales force system and so what we've
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
done in the budget is subtracted what we
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
would pay doit for the sales force and
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
put it towards a new system
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
makes all the sense of the world so you
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
were fine as a beta but now that it's
 
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:46.450 align:start position:0%
time to roll out
 
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.310 align:start position:0%
time to roll out
[Laughter]

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
someone else would take the first plunge
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
you took all the arrows we did
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
a question representative
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you uh
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
dr o'neill this is uh representative uh
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
t belgium i have a question and please
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
excuse my ignorance
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not a parent but
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
what are the ages that you deal with for
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
child advocate i i don't know if they're
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
preteen or teens or what
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for my ignorance no
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's no problem thank you so much for
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
the question if i think that a lot of
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
people know about the office of the
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
child advocate when they have children
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
and more so when they have problems um
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
so the office of the child advocate
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
oversees all children's services
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
that the state offers or arranges so
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
that would include children from birth
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
to 18.
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
we do actually serve some children who
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
are older who are still served by the
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
system up to age 20 or 21 or so we
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't drop them if they need and
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
those are children who would be
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
who who would be or should be served by
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
say child protection um who may be
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
involved in juvenile justice and now
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
with the expansion of our statute we
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
expect that we'll get um cases involving
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
education access to special education
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
children who need developmental
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
disability services and already we're
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
getting very very busy in the area of
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
mental and behavioral health you know
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
we're following and working hard on the
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
issue of children who are stuck in
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms seeking acute
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
although yeah thank you
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
dr o'neal just a follow-up
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
in cases and i don't know what they've
 
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.750 align:start position:0%
in cases and i don't know what they've
reversed

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
reversed
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
you know how you handle this in cases
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
where teenagers due to substance abuse
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
end up abusing their parents which
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
department actually takes care of that
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so that's
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's there's a two a couple
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
answers for that you know if there's if
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
has um some kind of problem that the
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
parents aren't attending to that could
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
be child protection um uh if the police
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
are called because the pan because the
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
child has assaulted the parent that's
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice both of those are under
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
dcyf the division for children youth and
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
families but that also sounds as though
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
the child needs behavioral health
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
services which would be under the
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
division of behavior children's
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
behavioral health in um dhhs so so and
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's where the office of the child
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
advocate can act as sort of a conduit to
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that all agencies are working
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that child gets their
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
needs met
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
thank you uh dr o'neill i'm glad that
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's that you were as a conduit as well
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
that makes things a lot easier for
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
well we can look you're you're you have
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:52.550 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
on page 134 of our budget books
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh and it goes 134 and part way down
 
00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:04.069 align:start position:0%
uh and it goes 134 and part way down
135.

00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
we have other departments that come in
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
that have 130 pages so yes thank you for
 
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.949 align:start position:0%
that have 130 pages so yes thank you for
that

00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
this one you can catch in one one
 
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:13.850 align:start position:0%
we are a heavy lift
 
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.790 align:start position:0%
we are a heavy lift
[Laughter]

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
any any questions on the budget
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman this is representative
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
walls i'm not sure you can see when i
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
raised my hand oh sorry well that's okay
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not afraid to speak up
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
so mora
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
actually everybody that's coming in here
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
seems to be on a 15 cut of general funds
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
you're not your budget looks like you're
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
doing you actually go up in your budget
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
um it is you know you've said what you
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
need you need a new a news system you
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
need a car and you need a new person
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
but other than it looks like in all
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
honesty you kind of came out of this
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
budget process unscathed compared to
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
everybody else am i reading this
 
00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.350 align:start position:0%
everybody else am i reading this
correctly

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for that question i i don't
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
think we would ever say we're unscathed
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
because we are so small we have such a
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
broad mandate but we did i believe we
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
made a good argument because of the
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
statute change and the mandate that
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
expanded i think the governor took that
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
into consideration um and allowed us to
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
have actually in the governor's budget
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
he gave us a new halftime position a
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
permanent halftime position um so we are
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
actually asking for that halftime
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
position we asked for that to be a
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
full-time position and we asked for yet
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
another position as well
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
and then the vehicle is we believe a
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
cost-saving measure
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
because we do have a great deal of
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
travel ahead of us
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
once the pandemic is over
 
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
no one has been inside any of the
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
facilities where children are placed
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
there's currently almost 400 children
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
who are institutionalized around the
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
state and around the country
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
those children who are out of state are
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
only visited by dcyf once every three
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
months so people aren't inspecting the
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
buildings where they are they're not
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
making sure that the children feel
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
connected um and and in the last budget
 
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.909 align:start position:0%
connected um and and in the last budget
deliberations

00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
deliberations
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
we had received a mandate to um you know
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
be sure that we were visiting children
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
from from this um committee in division
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
three um and because of
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
what happened with the budget veto and
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
then we were down a staff we weren't
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
able to fill and then the pandemic
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
happened we haven't been able to achieve
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
that so we anticipate a great deal of
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
travel this this coming year
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
do you have any unfunded positions
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
um no we had one position that was
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
frozen that just opened up and we're
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
just interviewing to fill that um next
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
week hopefully that will be filled soon
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
um so that would bring us up to
 
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.669 align:start position:0%
um so that would bring us up to
uh

00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
five unclassified positions
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and uh and
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
right five fun classified now we're
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
asking for a six karen is that correct
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes um that once we fill that
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
position we would have um four
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
unclassified four yes and so we're
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
asking for a fifth
 
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.190 align:start position:0%
asking for a fifth
um

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
and there's also i should point out
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's an inconsistency
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
in line 11 for the um unclassified
 
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.270 align:start position:0%
in line 11 for the um unclassified
position

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
where um the there's there's different
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
amounts when we were threatened in the
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
early negotiations with the budget we
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
were threatened with having to cut staff
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
and we noted that the salary for the
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
child advocate was listed in the budget
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
as much higher than
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
what's actually been paid and so we took
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
out that difference and so now it looks
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
as though there's actually a cut in pay
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
in the bienni in the next biennium
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
where we just kept it steady because it
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
well i thank you i just say i am a huge
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
fan of you and your office and the work
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
you do and i have been since you arrived
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
and i am immensely relieved to see that
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
you are being as supported as you are by
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
the governor it's uh because so much
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
else has been caught and this is i'm
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
sure you feel like you're being deprived
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
in some ways every office head does but
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
let me tell you that compared to what
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
we've seen elsewhere in this budget um
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just relieved and i know you're a
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
small office it would have a huge impact
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
um but still you're coming out in in
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
much better shape than i was fearful of
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm very happy for you
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
thank you representative waltz for your
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
kind words um and and we we are very
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
grateful um and we do believe that um
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
that we're able to play a role that's
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
that's significant and we think and the
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
position that we're filling next week is
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
a data analyst position and so we think
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be able to
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a lot more to folks with
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
that person and their ability
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
to show the cost savings across the
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
children's system um that we're able to
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
impact um with the work that we do so
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward to being able to
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
do that and we very much appreciate the
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
task before you we're you know if we
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
don't take it lightly when we're asking
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
for funds because we know that you have
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of difficult decisions to make we
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
well i think that i think that
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
kind of wraps it up who have no
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
additional questions and you you seem
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
satisfied with your budget
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
we certainly are
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
so at this point
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%

appeared pro se

adequately staffed to complete all of
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%

looked through it and we didn't see
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
anything that applied to the board so
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%

it involves preambulation i mean town
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
borders and whatnot that is an ongoing
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
problems and every time we want to
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
solve it we can't and the towns are
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
walk the borders

you can hear it there's a
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
pair to it in the back and the fans run
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
all the time i'm sure you can hear the
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
noise that ambient noise also goes
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
across all of our mics so we're trying
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
to pull the mics as close together as
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
the mission of the dra is to fairly and
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
efficiently administer the tax laws of
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire collecting
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
the proper amount of taxes due while
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
incurring the lease cost to taxpayers in
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
a manner that merits the highest degree
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
of public confidence in our integrity
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
further we provide prompt and
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
constructive assistance to the municipal
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
units of government in matters of budget
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
finance and the appraisal of real estate
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
together we have developed a thoughtful
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
operating budget that will provide the
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
resources for our team to administer the
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
tax laws of our state for another two
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal years in a manner that is
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
consistent with this mission
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
as the primary revenue collection agency
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
we are certainly aware of the current
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
revenue picture and have worked hard to
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
produce a budget that's consistent with
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
the targets provided
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2020 the dra collected
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
2.2 billion in state revenue with a
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
total expense of less than 19.4 million
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
some of those expenses are for
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
activities unrelated to revenue
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
collections such as local assessments
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
and state aid
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
when those unrelated costs are accounted
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
for our cost of collection is three
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
quarters of one percent
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
the information included with this
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
testimony explains how we're able to
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
build the biennial budget that continues
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
to be an unparalleled return on state
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
tax dollar investment
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
we look forward to working with you and
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
developing this budget
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
next madam chair i'm going to move to
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
the questions that you provided thank
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
you and our answers certainly so
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
what new full-time staff has been added
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
to your budget there are no new
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
positions general funded or otherwise
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
that were added to the dra operating
 
00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.230 align:start position:0%
that were added to the dra operating
budget

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
what new part-time staff have been added
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
there are no new part-time staff
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
positions added to the budget
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
what positions had to be eliminated in
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
order to meet the governor's budget
 
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.990 align:start position:0%
order to meet the governor's budget
requirements

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
we have seven unfunded positions
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
that have been removed from the dra
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
we've included the division position
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
number labor grade title and cost for
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
each position in the chart provided in
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
the letter
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
four of those positions are in the
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayer services division which helped
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
to timely process tax returns and
 
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.789 align:start position:0%
to timely process tax returns and
documents

00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
i would note that the clerk 3 position
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
is currently unfunded in our current
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
budget and remains unfunded in the
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
there is a municipal accounts auditor in
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
the municipal and property division that
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
person provides technical assistance to
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
municipal officials and establishes
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
property tax rates
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
lastly there are two multi-state tax
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
auditors in the audit division they
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
primarily audit large multinational
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
corporations for compliance with new
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire's tax laws
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
these two positions were new in our
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021 budget however they
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
were not filled prior to the kobit 19
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic and then we went into the
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
so those positions remain unfilled the
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
estimated revenue for those positions
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
was zero dollars in fiscal year 20 as
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
they are training
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
how will work done by these positions be
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
accomplished without them the workload's
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
been distributed among the funded
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
positions within each division to ensure
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
each division meets their respective
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
missions as well as meeting the overall
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
mission of the department
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
is your agency adequately staffed to
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
complete all work assigned to your
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
agency yes we are
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
what things are you doing found in state
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
law that could be eliminated and why
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
gra runs a pretty lean operation we
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any programs that could be
 
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.910 align:start position:0%
don't have any programs that could be
eliminated

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
and were there any priorities that were
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
not funded all of our fun uh prioritized
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
needs were funded in the governor's
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
last lastly lastly sections of hb2 we
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
have noted that there are a number
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
of sections that apply to the tax laws
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
which we administer
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
um however there are no changes that
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
would impact our operating budget and we
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
can administer the proposed changes to
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
the tax laws within our current
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
operating budget so i don't have any
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
concerns with what is included in house
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
division before we move on
 
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:51.349 align:start position:0%
division before we move on
representation

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
scoot your microphone close to you
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
remember we are
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
this hybrid world is not working well
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
for meetings
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
so two years ago it was very important
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
to us as you recall to get those two
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
auditors to audit those out-of-state
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
larger companies
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me i know that they're
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
not included
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned what 1.5 million
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
dollars is a minimum they would bring in
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
would you advocate that we'd really
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
support those two positions to get that
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
additional funding are you still happy
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
not i'm you're not happy but not having
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
those two positions seems like
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
a foolish thing for us to not do sure
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um certainly
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
the additional bodies would assist us
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
with generating the revenue um i will
 
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
note during the presentation we have a
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
high number of vacancies at this point
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
giving the hiring freeze
 
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.750 align:start position:0%
giving the hiring freeze
so

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
we will be we have unfilled positions
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
that are similar to those those
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
multi-state auditors we have unfilled
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
positions that are included in the
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
operating budget that we would hope to
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
fill during the biennium if the
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
additional positions were added we would
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
certainly do our best to fill those
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
positions as well but again we were
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
trying to be mindful of the targets that
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
were provided to us further follow up
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair so how many vacant
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
funded positions do you have that's a
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
great question
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
you kind of walked into the question but
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
sure um and i was going to go over this
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
when we move on to the presentation but
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
we currently have 25 um vacant positions
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
out of 156
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
full-time funded positions so that's a
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate of about 16 wow that's
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
pretty significant uh thanks madam chair
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
well the corollary to that have you been
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
given permission to hire any of those
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
500 since the hiring freeze has
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
been right we have we are currently
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
recruiting for three positions um we
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
believe that we can fill those positions
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
and still meet our lapse requirements um
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
i am hopeful actually that some of those
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
positions will be internal promotions
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
and so we might be able to hire further
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
beyond that um and kind of move people
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
up through the organization okay why
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
don't we continue with your presentation
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
see no other questions at the moment
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
great so um slide two of the
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
presentation is just our mission
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
statement i read that during the opening
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
remarks so i will skip that
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
um slide three this is just a general
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
organizational chart uh just for folks
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
to understand what we do at the
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
department of revenue we have our
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
administration unit which includes all
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
of our back office functions
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
we have our audit division which does
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
exactly that there are primary auditors
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
for tax compliance within the
 
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.390 align:start position:0%
for tax compliance within the
organization

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
our collections division
 
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.750 align:start position:0%
our collections division
pursues

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
pursues
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
unpaid tax bills that are beyond their
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
appeal process
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
our taxpayer services division
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
handles all routine interactions with
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
the department so they're our primary
 
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.829 align:start position:0%
the department so they're our primary
processing

00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
processing
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
unit for tax returns and tax forms that
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
we receive they also man our call center
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
so anytime you call into the dra and you
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
speak with our lovely call center
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
representatives there in the taxpayer
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
services division and this division also
 
00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:03.910 align:start position:0%
services division and this division also
um

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
does all of our account maintenance so
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
if you called in
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
wanting to move a payment
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
that sort of routine maintenance is done
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
within taxpayer services so if you're
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
not under audit and we're not looking to
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
collect from you your interactions are
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
primarily with our taxpayer services
 
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.109 align:start position:0%
primarily with our taxpayer services
division

00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
lastly our municipal and property
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
division those are the folks that set
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
the tax rates review the assessments for
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
our municipal folks
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
they also administer the utility
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
property tax the timber tax and the
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
on slide four i've provided a big
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
picture overview of our fiscal year 22
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
23 budget compared to our fiscal year 21
 
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.750 align:start position:0%
23 budget compared to our fiscal year 21
budget

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
so you'll see i have broken it out by
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
general funds education trust funds and
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
agency income
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
our fiscal year 2022 budget is just over
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
a million dollars less than our fiscal
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
year 2021 budget for general funds
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
we're about 950 000 less in education
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
trust funds
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
and our agency income remains flat
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the biennium
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2023 or about 200 000
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
less in general funds than 950 000 less
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
in education trust fund and flat funding
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
for agency income
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
so you will see that the difference
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
between for the total budget for fiscal
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
year 2022 is just under 2 million
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
compared to fiscal year 21 and just
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
under 1.2 million or 1.1 million uh for
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 as compared to 21. so
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's an eight and a half percent
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
reduction in fiscal year 22 and a 5.4
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
reduction in fiscal year 23.
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
at the bottom you will see that our
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
position count remains static as i
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have not added any new
 
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.069 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have not added any new
positions

00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
but as i did note current funded
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
position count has decreased from 156
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
full-time classified and unclassified
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
positions in fiscal year 21 to 150
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
positions in fiscal years 22 and 23.
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
our general fund operating budget is 75
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits we are the
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
department of people not things or
 
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.309 align:start position:0%
department of people not things or
programs

00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
all of the positions that we propose to
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
unfund are currently vacant
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
and funding in our budget does include
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
the following positions that are
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
currently vacant but would generate
 
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.829 align:start position:0%
currently vacant but would generate
revenue

00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
so you'll see there's about seven
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in fiscal year
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
22 and 3.2 million dollars in fiscal
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
year 23
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
that would be generated by currently
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
vacant positions that are funded in the
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and 23 budget and we have
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
provided madam chair those numbers to
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
house ways and means so they are aware
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
of those anticipated revenues and just
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
so you know i did ask
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
chairman major in house ways and means
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
did he include this funding
 
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.109 align:start position:0%
did he include this funding
in

00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:41:55.119 --> 00:41:56.069 align:start position:0%
in
his

00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates the house voted on the
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
answer to that was no because it was not
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
current law and current law had them
 
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.230 align:start position:0%
current law and current law had them
unfunded

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
if i
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
go back to the questions you answered
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
the position numbers are in those
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
questions when we went through before
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
right yes they are correct okay thank
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide five some things to
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
note about our operating budget
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
so our doit services and positions are
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
all maintained
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
the doit budget
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
costs are steady over the biennium but
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
they are reduced by approximately 8.7
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
percent compared to fiscal year 21.
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
funding for vendors such as our
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
equalization and tax rate setting vendor
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
and temporary keying services are
 
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.950 align:start position:0%
and temporary keying services are
included

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
i have noted uh where those
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
live within the budget equalization and
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
tax rate setting contract amount has
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
been reduced to reflect updated contract
 
00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.829 align:start position:0%
been reduced to reflect updated contract
pricing

00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
that can be found on page 159
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
and our temporary keying services
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
contract amount was reduced to reflect
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
actual costs over the past few years as
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
more and more documents are coming in
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
electronically we don't have the need
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
for those keying services so we have
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
kind of right-sized that appropriation
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
the budget also maintains operational
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
capabilities as we anticipate adjusting
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
resources for our new rims project
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
however we did eliminate our rims
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
consulting services and that is found on
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
page 153
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is um we had started
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
those services with our capital budget
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation those services have gone
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
very well and we have come in under
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
budget so we're able to continue with
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
the services without needing the funding
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
in our operating budget
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
other reductions
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the budget include in our
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
out-of-state travel employee training
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
overtime and current expense
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
these were due to meeting the targets
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
provided by the governor
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
the division director's business office
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
and other managers have worked very hard
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
to budget conservatively and accurately
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
requesting funds for true needs and not
 
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.030 align:start position:0%
requesting funds for true needs and not
wants

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide six
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
i wanted to highlight the low and
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
moderate property tax relief so this is
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
funded through the education trust fund
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
and it is property tax relief program
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
related to the statewide education
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
we have funded this
 
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
at 800 000 in both fiscal year 22 and
 
00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.910 align:start position:0%
at 800 000 in both fiscal year 22 and
23.

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
23.
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
this is another example of kind of right
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
sizing the appropriation i've include
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
the i've included the program costs over
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
the past three years and you'll see that
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
the costs of the program have decreased
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
so we adjusted the funding within the
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
budget from the education trust fund to
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
reflect what we believe to be the true
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
cost of the program so we didn't want to
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
next on slide seven one of my favorite
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
topics um flood control
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
oh good because that's one of ours too
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
we're gonna ask questions so you could
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
see those questions coming yes
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
so our budget includes eight hundred and
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
eighty seven thousand dollars
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh 256 000 from the general fund and 630
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
000 from other funds in fiscal year 22
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
and the same amount in fiscal year 23
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
and that can be found on page 160.
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
this program reimburses cities and towns
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
for lost property taxes resulting from
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
property acquired in the acquisition of
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
land by the united states for navigation
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
and flood control so these are the
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
merrimack river valley compact and the
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
connecticut river valley compacts
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
the budget does assume that
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts will reimburse their share
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
of 70 percent of the merrimack river
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
valley compact as well as 50 percent of
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
the connecticut river valley compact and
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
that connecticut will reimburse their
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
share of 40 of the connecticut river
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
valley compact
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
as you likely know there's a long
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
history of massachusetts not paying its
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
obligation timely or sufficiently for
 
00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.390 align:start position:0%
obligation timely or sufficiently for
the

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
merrimack river valley compact there is
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
currently just shy of 3 million dollars
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
currently outstanding for fiscal years
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
15 through 20. payments up to fiscal
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
year 14 have been settled in an
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
agreement with massachusetts
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
the governor is authorized to draw a
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
warrant for the payment of such
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursements out of money in the
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
treasury that is not otherwise
 
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
treasury that is not otherwise
appropriated

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
we estimate that the warrant that will
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
be issued for fiscal year 21 is just
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
over six hundred thousand dollars
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
i would note the governor's office and
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh the attorney general's office uh are
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
very much aware of this issue and it is
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding um that they are
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
working on trying to resolve these
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
amounts due from the commonwealth of
 
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.069 align:start position:0%
amounts due from the commonwealth of
massachusetts

00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
so thanks for your thorough presentation
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
on that last night i received an email
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
from ann rice at the attorney general's
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
office we had inquired
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
earlier in the day about the status of
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
the flood control
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
and she pointed out that they're working
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
diligently however
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're still waiting for arbitrators to
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
be appointed
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
and has no idea when that might happen
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
so the likelihood
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
you correctly stated
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
in her email
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
she also said it's been since 2014 so it
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't look like we're going
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
to get any of that money soon manager i
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
think i sent you an
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
a copy of her email but
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
i think you should probably know that it
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't look good
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
but thanks for your presentation that
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
was my understanding as well that we're
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
working on it but it's not maybe going
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
to be anytime soon can we bring this to
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
a final resolution it's my understanding
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
there could be a one-time settlement
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
right and that is what we um that we did
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
settle up to 14 and so there i think
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
could be the opportunity to settle for
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
the amounts due from 15 through 20 and
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
likely 21
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
but the best way to do that would
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
probably be a question directed rightly
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
can you ask ann edwards that you started
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
that email training
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
i think part of the problem in
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts right now is they don't
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
have any more money we have plus they
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
sent home all the workers who work out
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
of state and new hampshire is one of the
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
states suing them because of their state
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
law that said if you're working at home
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
you don't have to pay taxes so now
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
everybody's working at home because you
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
locked them out
 
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.069 align:start position:0%
locked them out
right

00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay on slide eight i just did want to
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
give a couple updates on the priorities
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
from our fiscal year 2021 budget
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
the first is what the result are first
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
is our new revenue information system or
 
00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:56.549 align:start position:0%
is our new revenue information system or
rims

00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
rims
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
as you may know dra received a 30
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
million 160 000 capital appropriation
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
through general funds and other funds to
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
replace our old uh software system
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
we entered into a contract with fast
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
enterprises on october 31st 2018 to
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
implement the commercial off-the-shelf
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
software gen tax
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
that cost is just under 30 million
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
roll out one we have three rollouts
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
rollout one went live on october 28 2019
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
with the meals and rentals tax medicaid
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax and nursing facility
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
quality assessment
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
rollout 2 went live in the middle of a
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic on october 5th 2020 with our
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
largest tax types the business profits
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
tax business enterprise tax interest and
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
and then rollout three is on schedule to

[Music]
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly on page nine the rims
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
health assessments i mentioned this was
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
a cost that was previously included in
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
our operating budget
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
it was a prioritized need from last
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
budget of 340 000
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
to assist dra with periodic project
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
health assessments
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
barry dunn is our vendor for that as i
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned the assessments have gone very
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
well and so we don't need the operating
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
budget funding we've been able to cover
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
all of the assessments all the way
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
through rollout three within our capital
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
budget they have completed six project
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
health assessments so far all of which
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
gave the project an overall score of a
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
five or outstanding with no actions or
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
changes recommended so we really have
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
had a very successful project with rims
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
lastly i'll just mention and we have
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
touched upon this already
 
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.030 align:start position:0%
touched upon this already
in

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
the final fiscal year 2020 2021 budget
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
there were additional positions in the
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
audit division that were included
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
there was an in-state and multi-entity
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
auditors funded for both 20 and 21
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
there were two multi-state auditors for
 
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
half of fiscal year 20 and all of 21 and
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
then an additional multi-state auditor
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
funded just for fiscal year 2021.
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
all of these positions may remain
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
unfilled by the time the budget finally
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
passed the positions were generated
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
within the system
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
we were coming into the january february
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
time frame pandemic hit and we were
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
unable to hire
 
00:52:40.079 --> 00:52:40.870 align:start position:0%
unable to hire
um

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
as we mentioned and talked about there
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
are two multi-state auditor positions
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
that are unfunded in 22 and 23 as i
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
that is all i have madam chair i'm happy
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner is there anything in your
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
line item budget that you would like to
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
talk about or that is changed or
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
beyond what your presentation was and
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
again you're like
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
most of our state agencies for this
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
biennium you have cut positions cut
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
spending and are moving forward with
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
belt tightening given the pandemic
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
that is an accurate statement i have
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
noted for you in the presentation what i
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
believe are all the large fluctuations
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
that you would see
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned there are a few other
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
instances where you'll see current
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
expense or employee training has changed
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
and that is as you mentioned adam chair
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
the belt tightening but the large
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
changes should be referenced in the
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
presentation so i think um we have
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
representation thanks madam chair
 
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
so either you or john beardmore prepared
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
for us several years back the breakdown
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the flood control towns and the
 
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.069 align:start position:0%
of the flood control towns and the
payments

00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
so what the state would be sending to
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
say hopkinton or peterborough whatever
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
could you do that again sure for that
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
hundred what's it six hundred and
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
sixteen thousand dollars and what that
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
breakdown would be sure happy to do that
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair you're welcome and i
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
think that's important
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner before we got started
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other questions right
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
now but i had asked a
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
question about
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
ppe loans
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
i think everybody in the legislature has
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
probably heard from one or more
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
constituents about ppe loans and i know
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to you said you'd send me
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
something right and i would like it but
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
i would also i think like to talk about
 
00:54:40.799 --> 00:54:41.510 align:start position:0%
i would also i think like to talk about
that

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
a little bit while we have the public on
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
because we do have two representatives
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
at home
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
who did not hear that conversation
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
a few attendees
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
so when we started what i said to the
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner was i'm a small business i
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
got a hundred thousand dollars in a ppe
 
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.510 align:start position:0%
got a hundred thousand dollars in a ppe
loan

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
loan
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
and it became both a debit and a credit
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
because i had a loan and then i had a
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
credit because i had a hundred thousand
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
but then i applied for the loan
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
forgiveness i was given the loan
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
forgiveness that loan now turned into
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
only a credit and a grant
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
so i no longer had a loan that i had to
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
pay back so my debit went away but i
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
still had a grant of a hundred thousand
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
dollars and my question was what is the
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
tax implication on that and this is
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
apparently two part there's something
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
the feds are doing which is above and
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
beyond what the state is doing as well
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
as what the state is doing so
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner if you could just run
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
through that because i heard uh
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative griffin representative
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
leishman were both interested i have a
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
feeling that our two representatives at
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
home might have the same interest and we
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
have some time sure i'm happy to go
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
through that so yes madam chair so let's
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
assume that there is a ppp loan of a
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
if and when that loan is forgiven you're
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
correct it becomes a grant
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
for state tax purposes that hundred
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is going to be included
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
in gross income
 
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
any expenses
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
that were paid with that grant and again
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
ppp is payroll protection there are
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
likely wages that were paid with that
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
money any other normal operating
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
business expenses to keep your business
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
open and operating those expenses are
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
deductible so you would see a hundred
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars come in in gross income
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
and then likely a hundred thousand
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
dollars being deducted for wages and
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
normal operating business expenses
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
that means the result impact to
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
your net income to which you would apply
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax rate would be
 
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.470 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax rate would be
zero

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
so so long as the amounts were spent on
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
deductible expenses there would be no
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
business profits tax implications there
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
would be no business profits tax due
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
that's at the state level now let's talk
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
about the federal treatment
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
back and forth with how this was going
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
to be treated federally but the outcome
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
that hundred thousand dollar grant
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
although any other grant would be
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
included in gross income that hundred
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar ppp grant the feds have
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
said you don't include that in gross
 
00:57:20.079 --> 00:57:21.109 align:start position:0%
said you don't include that in gross
income

00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not going in your gross income
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
but you can still deduct the expenses
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
that you used or that you paid for with
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
that money so if you spent the hundred
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars on wages those wages
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
are still deductible
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
so that is an additional benefit and
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
will further reduce
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
the taxes that you owe at the federal
 
00:57:44.319 --> 00:57:45.430 align:start position:0%
the taxes that you owe at the federal
level

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
so again it's a benefit that the federal
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
government has provided to those folks
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
that have received a ppp loan
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3 is currently in the senate
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
has passed out of the ways and means
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
committee has not yet gone to the floor
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3 would have the state
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
following the federal treatment where
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
that additional benefit would be
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
provided to ppp
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
to businesses that received ppp and that
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
loan was forgiven so those that have ppp
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
grants would have this beneficial tax
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
treatment that's essentially what senate
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
bill 3 does
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned madam chair and i'm
 
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
happy to share with the committee um
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
i'll send to the committee there is a
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
tax information release or a tir that's
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
available on our website that walks
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
through this we've also put out
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
a press release
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
to help get this information out about
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
the difference in the federal and the
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
state tax treatment
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative are you raising your hand
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
i yes i am i just did thank you um so
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
you talked about the bpt what about the
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
b-e-t is there an effect on that
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
so the um bet if the ppp loan was paid i
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
used to pay wages those wages would be
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
does senate bill 3
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3 does not address bet okay
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
i guess i have it
 
00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.150 align:start position:0%
i guess i have it
represented

00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.670 align:start position:0%
represented
please

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
so now what about the main street grants
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
or i thought you were going to ask that
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
next that's that's a great question
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
this treatment is only for ppp
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
it is not for main street grants it's
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
not for
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
the self grants it's not for any other
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
grants this treatment is only for ppp
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
and so this beneficial treatment would
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
only be available to those
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
that received ppp
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
and we know that there may be a lot of
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
reasons why a business didn't receive
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
ppp um and so there there is potent
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
there is a fairness issue here it would
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
only be benefiting those that received
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
ppp and if your business did not receive
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
ppp you would follow the normal tax
 
01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.270 align:start position:0%
ppp you would follow the normal tax
treatment

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
but again if the amounts are spent on
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
deductible expenses there really should
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
be no impact there should be no tax
 
01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:24.870 align:start position:0%
be no impact there should be no tax
impact

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
can i just to follow up walls yes
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
when you say there should be no taxable
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
impact does that mean in the bet too
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
because that they would be able to
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
deduct the wages that they paid so
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
there's no taxable impact there no sorry
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking about bpt
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
only only bpt right so they would be
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
grants would come in gross income any
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
amount spent on deductible expenses
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
would be a deducted out and therefore
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
the impact for bpt would be minimal so
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
long as the amounts were spent on
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
deductible expenses
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
that was how i initially understood it i
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be make sure i wasn't
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
convoluting things sure thank you
 
01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.349 align:start position:0%
convoluting things sure thank you
yeah

01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:01:09.359 --> 01:01:11.910 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
busy very busy
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
i am inclined to
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
fund those positions
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i have already emailed while we're
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
sitting here lba and asked them to do
 
01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.230 align:start position:0%
sitting here lba and asked them to do
that

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
so lindsay we're not going to take any
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
action on this budget at this time i
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't know when we will get our
 
01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.230 align:start position:0%
don't know when we will get our
amendment

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.870 align:start position:0%
amendment
but

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you you heard what we said yes
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
thank you yes you do thank you
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
see no other questions i want to thank
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
you for coming this morning spending
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
time with us i want to thank you for
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
being so well prepared and
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you it's nice to see everybody in
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
person yes
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes we're very happy that vaccines are
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
out and we've started getting vaccinated
 
01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:08.870 align:start position:0%
out and we've started getting vaccinated
and

01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's even nicer that the cdc is
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
there is a positive impact because i

communities and create and retain jobs
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
annually each state new hampshire and
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
we do this in partnership for new

hampshire develop the funding priorities

and criteria for selected projects
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
the department of housing and urban

development uses a formula to allocate
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
these resources and if funding levels
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
remain similar to years in past we
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate that new hampshire's total
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
cdbg allocation over the next biennium
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%

dollars
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
cdfa provides the state with
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
exceptionally cost efficient system for
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
providing these resources to communities
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
cdfa is financially self-sufficient and
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
relies on fees from the from the
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
programs we administer plus this state
 
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.029 align:start position:0%
programs we administer plus this state

01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
we can deploy approximately

01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
cnn this budget is the only thing it has
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
in it is the two hundred thousand dollar

match which is flat funded there we do
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%

i'm going to turn this over to
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative leishman this is an
 
01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.470 align:start position:0%
representative leishman this is an
amendment

01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
to hb2
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative leichmann
 
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair or nancy can we have this
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
zoomed in some it's thank you
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
yeah a little bit better
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
how about a little bit how's that
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you okay
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair um
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
and i will turn very quickly to house
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill 2 i believe this is section 9.
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
so this changes the language you'll see
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
presently on section nine where it says
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
of the general court may approve changes
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
to the above plan design cost sharing
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
provisions consistent with rsa 21-i
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
colon 3
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
i found the language a little
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
problematic if you go to the judicial
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
council there's similar
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
language to my amendment so what i'm
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
looking to do
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
um in line seven
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
starting after the comma
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
one or i
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
which is part of the rsa
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
again everyone seen that on line seven
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
are permitted with the prior approval
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee of the general
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
court so i just think it clears up the
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
language a little bit from the existing
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
section nine
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of this
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that there is no confusion
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
about the role of the fiscal
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
committee of the general court that's
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
correct madam chair any discussion by
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
seeing on representative leashman might
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
i assume that you move adoption of
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair i would

when the clerk is ready
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%

01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
mr little discussed with us in depth
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
that public deposit investment pool
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
where he felt like he had a conflict of
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
interest because he was supposed to be
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
protecting and then it looked like he
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
was working
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
kind of against the people he was
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to be protecting and he
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
proposed this language which we
 
01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.390 align:start position:0%
proposed this language which we
discussed

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
at the time and asked that it be added
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
to hb2
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
as an amendment in order to provide
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
proper protection for the banking
 
01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:57.110 align:start position:0%
proper protection for the banking
commissioner

01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
it also allows him to charge
 
01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.270 align:start position:0%
it also allows him to charge
appropriately

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
so that the customers
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
that he's supposed to be protecting are
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
not paying for it but that the public
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
pool is paying for
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
the expenses
 
01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:17.430 align:start position:0%

madam chair represent walls
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
to be clear this simply changes how it's
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
paid for all we're doing is moving
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
how this is paid for am i correct that
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
is correct if you recall
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner little did not have a way
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%

pay for the cost of his involvement and
 
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
instead it was being charged to his
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
customers so he feels that this is a
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
fairer situation provides the
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate protection allows him to do
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
the job he's supposed to do and protect
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%

change to this section
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
as proposed the fund would have been
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing and continuously
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
appropriated however that language has
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
been removed
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
one of the things we discovered
 
01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:11.910 align:start position:0%
one of the things we discovered
when

01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
governor hassan vetoed the min the
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
budget was that things that were
 
01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.790 align:start position:0%
budget was that things that were
continuously

01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
continuously
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
approved continued being spent without
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
any input from
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature and i think on both
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
sides last year when representative
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
lovejoy was
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
chairing division one and now we made an
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
effort to take that out and leave things
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
as it was and i
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
thought she was doing the right thing
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
and i followed along with that

let's see if i can find the numbers i
want

01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
because we have a few minutes
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
peter you're not ready with your
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
amendment on section 19 is that correct
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
is that that late nancy is working on it
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
nancy's working on that okay we will
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
could lba help us with section 51 which
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
we did not adopt
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
page 24. it is an agricultural
 
01:25:32.239 --> 01:25:38.550 align:start position:0%
page 24. it is an agricultural
section

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
and as i understand this this amendment
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
is only adding the division of pesticide
 
01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.950 align:start position:0%
is only adding the division of pesticide
control

01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes this is mike hoffman looking at
 
01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:52.830 align:start position:0%
yes this is mike hoffman looking at
section

01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
51 the previous language said the fund
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
shall only be used to support the
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
purposes of the integrated pest
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
management program
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
this ads
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
and the division of pesticide control
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
so it expands uh the availability of
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
that fund to the division and not just
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
that seems
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay to me is there anybody have any
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
problem with this i
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
i can't remember why we didn't do it
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
while the commissioner was here
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
i just haven't rubbed his own walls
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
please i'm not sure anybody knows the
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
answer to this but i it does jump at me
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
and that is integrated pest management
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
suggests it may or may not include
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
chemicals division of pesticide control
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
pesticides or chemicals and i'm
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if this is some sort of
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
significant policy change of moving from
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
organic to chemical control
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
i know
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's the addition of a division for
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
funding purposes so that was taken out
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
of general funds
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay just i didn't know the implications
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
of it and if perhaps that's what this
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative emerick moves to approve

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.950 align:start position:0%
could lba walk us through section 55.
um

01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think nancy you told me this section
 
01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.229 align:start position:0%
i think nancy you told me this section
was

01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
we probably why we didn't do anything
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
with it yeah i can uh try to screen
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
share some of the information that i
 
01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.510 align:start position:0%
share some of the information that i
provided

01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.830 align:start position:0%
provided
previously

01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
the question was i said you know why
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
don't we just delete this because
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
they've got less money the rooms and
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
meals taxes down we don't need it
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
and then it was like well what are we
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
really deleting nancy started looking
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
into the history it was pretty
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
convoluted so i thought i'd have her
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
share with us what she found before we
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
do anything we're not voting this today
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
this is just for us to think about
 
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
this this section has been suspended for
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
a number of bienniums and it it
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
it credits support to the meals and
 
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
rooms tax
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
based on a budget um from several
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
bienniums ago where the ruins and meals
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
tax was
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
increased in a portion of it 3.15
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
total collection net of expenses was
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
allocated for the budget of this
 
01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.830 align:start position:0%
allocated for the budget of this
division

01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:06.709 align:start position:0%
division
and

01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
each time
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
we try to verify that amount we kind of
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
run into a brick wall
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
i've contacted a number of departments
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
to verify what exactly that amount is
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
and um it is net of expenses that the
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
department of revenue
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
um has for collecting that tax which is
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
a calculation they have to do based on
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
the amount of tax they collect for all
 
01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.470 align:start position:0%
the amount of tax they collect for all
taxes

01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
there's a letter issued to the treasury
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
and then that is shared with the
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
department and the
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
governor's office and you see line items
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
for this item in your budget but there's
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
also an expense for the education trust
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
fund that's backed out debt service
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
and the calculation is done at the time
 
01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:50.229 align:start position:0%
and the calculation is done at the time
before

01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
figures are audited so it's kind of a
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
moving target
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
our calculations are are somewhat dated
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
so i have asked the department that
 
01:30:00.239 --> 01:30:01.669 align:start position:0%
so i have asked the department that
administers

01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
administers
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
division of travel and tourism to verify
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
the numbers in the budget i've asked the
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
governor's office to verify that they in
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
turn have asked the department of
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
and they're going to circle back to the
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
department of revenue
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
the short answer is that this um
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
this uh amount that was allocated as i
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
stated based on a um
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
increase in the rooms and meals tax was
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
done a number of years ago
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
as you well know that the governor has
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
now um
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
proposed decreasing that
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
act so
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
this figure will be in flux again in the
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
and uh i am still working to get an
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
accurate number for what the statutory
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh amount for this division is
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of what it what appears in
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
the budget there is a firm calculation
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
but i have not received it yet
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we're not taking any
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
action on that i just want you to know
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's a lot more complicated than you
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
might think from those two or three
 
01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:04.470 align:start position:0%
might think from those two or three
lines

01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:08.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman yesterday because now i want
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
to turn to page 40.
 
01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:13.830 align:start position:0%
to turn to page 40.
section

01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:19.590 align:start position:0%
section

01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
which leads into
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
something that we have to discuss
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
almost every
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
biennium and who wants to talk about
 
01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:32.390 align:start position:0%
biennium and who wants to talk about
that

01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
section 77
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh changes the
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
cap for the rate uh revenue
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
currently it's based on
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
general fund unrestricted revenue for
 
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
the most recently completed fiscal year
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
this would change it to the most
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
recently completed fiscal biennium
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
which would
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
assuming even revenues in each year
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
adam chair is this the rainy day fund
 
01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.470 align:start position:0%
adam chair is this the rainy day fund
yes

01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
so we haven't done anything with that
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not proposing we do something with
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
it right now but i wanted to know if the
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
division had
 
01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.390 align:start position:0%
division had
questions

01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have the
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director in
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
at one point to talk to us
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i think he will have
 
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:57.030 align:start position:0%
and i think he will have
probably

01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
some questions and some things to say to
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
us about that but if we're going to have
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions on it i wanted to get
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
that out
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
as soon as i could
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll just
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
think about think about that
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
i gotta tell you this is so much easier
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
when lba is in the room and you can say
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
hey nance and mike do we have an
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
amendment on hb1 or something and they
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
can say well would you like to do this
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
or would you like to do that and you can
 
01:33:49.199 --> 01:33:50.709 align:start position:0%
or would you like to do that and you can
just

01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
say yes and they hand it out for you
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:57.590 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
mike and nancy these are going to be
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
more difficult
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
i need to put up the errata sheet
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
technical corrections to source of funds
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
this is not general funds this is the
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
department of labor they brought this to
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
our attention
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
when they were here
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
all right if you recall
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
when mr maryfield was here he pointed
 
01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:35.510 align:start position:0%
when mr maryfield was here he pointed
out

01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:36.470 align:start position:0%
out
that

01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
agency income not general funds but
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
agency income
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
two of them just got swapped
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
and not
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
keyed in the right line
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
the adjustment to make that happen no
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
change in funding no change in bottom
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
line of the budget and just swap one
 
01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:58.390 align:start position:0%
line of the budget and just swap one
thing

01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative emerick moves to accept
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%

01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
did i not give you enough
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
oh no no i was talking about the roll
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
call sheet
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
which i'm gonna fill out
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay just i'm going to have lba
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
walk us through this but a little
 
01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.149 align:start position:0%
walk us through this but a little
background

01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
when department of corrections was here
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
this division discovered that the
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
educational vocational programs had been
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
i have said to helen that
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
we have money to put it back
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
and i wanted her to do a deep dive on
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
how she wanted it spread out and what
 
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
she needed to match the amount of money
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
that she was being given
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
this was
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
the top piece
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
is give it was
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
given to lba
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
and they worked on this this is a
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
two-page attachment because the
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
attachment is in order to fund this
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
what i have done
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
ways and means revenues are
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
too low
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
and we all know that we won't have the
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
march revenues nor will we have the
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
april which is when the business taxes
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
come in and we usually have a really big
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
month so i have taken the money
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
which is general fund dollars from the
 
01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.430 align:start position:0%
which is general fund dollars from the
governor's

01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund i have left the lines
 
01:38:10.239 --> 01:38:11.510 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund i have left the lines
open

01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
so that as this will have passed out of
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
us before that comes so the senate can
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
just flow the money back into that
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
transferred the money over to doc i
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
talked to the governor's budget director
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
he said that they had had
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
a great deal of difficulty when they
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
made that cut themselves and he
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
understood where we were going and he
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
appreciated leaving the two scholarship
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
lines open because they think as i think
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
that the economy is recovering and we
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
are going to see more revenue but we
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
have to go with the house ways and means
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
which was unanimous and those guys are
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
the experts and they're doing what they
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
have right now which i greatly respect
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
and i just tend to be a little more
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
optimistic about the future they can't
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
afford to be optimistic they have to be
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
accurate so their approach is a little
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
different so this is two page amendments
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
what we have lba would you walk us
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
through first the corrections piece
 
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:10.629 align:start position:0%
through first the corrections piece
yes

01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's the first page that you should
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
see on your screen
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
and this would restore funding the 21
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
positions that were unfunded
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
in the education and vocation programs
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
this information was provided by the
 
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.350 align:start position:0%
this information was provided by the
commissioner

01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the general phone totals
 
01:39:29.199 --> 01:39:30.189 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the general phone totals
of

01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
and then if i turn to the next page
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
you'll see the
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
governor scholarship
 
01:39:43.679 --> 01:39:45.030 align:start position:0%
governor scholarship
account

01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be on line 107
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
which is reduced and there's a dollar
 
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
left to hold the
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
i think everybody in the division
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
thought we should have
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
education in the prisons i know we were
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
sued over that i don't think prisoners
 
01:40:07.119 --> 01:40:09.430 align:start position:0%
sued over that i don't think prisoners
can

01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
develop skills to lead a meaningful life
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
if we can't provide some training
 
01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.070 align:start position:0%
if we can't provide some training
representation

01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i just like to thank you
 
01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.590 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i just like to thank you

01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
certainly we all recognize the
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
importance of this
 
01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:23.590 align:start position:0%
importance of this
and

01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that you
 
01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
have taken such a positive stance i just
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
want to say that's very much appreciated
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative madam chair
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative emerick is moving the
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
package of the amendment for the
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
department of corrections and the
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
amendment for the treasury treasury
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative griffin is seconding
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're open for for questions
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative walsh you have your hand
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
up please proceed i do thank you um so
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
i i'm assuming that what's not in here
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
is the transitional housing units all
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
we're restoring is the educational
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
monies is that correct that is correct
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay by the way i do want to enter
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
echo what representative leitchman said
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
i was shocked by these cuts and i am so
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
pleased that you are working to restore
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
them so i i just want to say that as
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
well i think these are crucial um thank
 
01:41:23.119 --> 01:41:23.910 align:start position:0%
well i think these are crucial um thank
you

01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:24.790 align:start position:0%
you
so

01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm as concerned about
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
transitional housing as you are but it
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
was kind of like one step at a time
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
sure and i appreciate that thank you i
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure i clearly it's
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
hard to see these on the screen and
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
particularly this is the first time
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're seeing them i wanted to be sure i
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
understood what we're seeing
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
the first time i'm seeing it as well so
 
01:41:43.119 --> 01:41:44.390 align:start position:0%
the first time i'm seeing it as well so
yes

01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so as well so i have two
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
questions one is the second page numbers
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
look like they're smaller than the first
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
page numbers
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
um maybe i'm misreading it they're a
 
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
little larger
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
no it looks like we're taking
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
we're spending more than we're taking is
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
what i'm suggesting maybe i'm not
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
misreading it but i look like if you if
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
you look at the change column
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
um you have house introduced and then
 
01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:11.830 align:start position:0%
um you have house introduced and then
change

01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
and then it
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at the bottom of
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
treasury right now we are are taking out
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
2.9 million if you look at corrections
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
nancy or mike if you can bring up
 
01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:24.870 align:start position:0%
nancy or mike if you can bring up
corrections

01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at the it's in the same
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
format we are spending two point two
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
million four hundred and seventy nine
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so we are
 
01:42:34.159 --> 01:42:35.350 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so we are
taking

01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
a little more than we are spending i am
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
aware we have a the transitional housing
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
issue and some other issues but this is
 
01:42:47.109 --> 01:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's what we have so we are spending
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
less than we are taking ever so slightly
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
now i see it thank you um
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
my second question is is that as i
 
01:42:56.719 --> 01:42:58.149 align:start position:0%
my second question is is that as i
recall

01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
um there was a total of an eight million
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
dollar cut to the corrections budget
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
if this looks like a restoring five
 
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
total so
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
an additional three million dollar cut
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
i guess that's primarily the
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
transitional housing without seeing the
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
whole no that's actually not right if
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
there was a larger amount of money
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
in the education than we're restoring
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
however the other thing i've done since
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
corrections was here remember they came
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
the first day i called helen and asked
 
01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:36.310 align:start position:0%
the first day i called helen and asked
her

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
if she could call commissioner edelblue
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
at department of education
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
because we have an online virtual
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
charter school that provides
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
some late elementary classes
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
and all of the high school classes
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
and with the new
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
women's prison
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
it was designed with an opportunity to
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
be able to take advantage of some of
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
that online
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
education as well for people trying to
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
get either their ged or finish out their
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
high school diploma she has reached out
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
to him
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
and she is also going to be using v-lacs
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
so there is a difference between what
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
she originally presented to the governor
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
with no velocs and what we're restoring
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the funding so she is giving up about
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
a million
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
point four in educational funding as
 
01:44:30.239 --> 01:44:32.629 align:start position:0%
point four in educational funding as
well

01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that explanation
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
because that was not obvious looking at
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
this i appreciate no it's not i'm sorry
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking i've had so many
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
phone calls
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
trying to work out some of these things
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
to fund some things that i'm losing my
 
01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:47.270 align:start position:0%
to fund some things that i'm losing my
mind

01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
there isn't enough wine in the world
 
01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's how i'm going to put it
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.629 align:start position:0%

vote seven nothing unanimous madam
 
01:45:35.530 --> 01:45:35.540 align:start position:0%

admin services
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
which i am seen for the first time
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to ask lba
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
to bring it up i'm not even going to be
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
able to speak to this i know that
 
01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:52.709 align:start position:0%
able to speak to this i know that
charlie

01:45:52.709 --> 01:45:52.719 align:start position:0%
charlie
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
sent this in
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
he did tell us in his presentation it
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
was coming
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
but i don't remember quite all the
 
01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:24.629 align:start position:0%
but i don't remember quite all the
details

01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay so whoever in
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
can i address that
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
there are nancy absolutely
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
there are three pages which amount to a
 
01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:35.990 align:start position:0%
there are three pages which amount to a
combined

01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
combined
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh 600 and 8 000 in fy 22 and 631 000
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
and fy
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
23 and what this is
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
is a reallocation of sorts of funds
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
for a budgetary transfer for maintenance
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
of buildings in
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
that are occupied by other agencies
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
and normally
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
and those agencies already have this
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
built into their agency transfers so
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
there's no corresponding change here but
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
it was misclassified
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the budget as general funds and it
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
should have been
 
01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.390 align:start position:0%
should have been
classified

01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
classified
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
as transfers from other agencies so
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
there are no impact to those agencies
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
but it does reduce the general fund
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
sorts of fund within the das budget and
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
increases the transfer line so the
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
agency nets that amount in general fund
 
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.189 align:start position:0%
agency nets that amount in general fund
dollars

01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
and that was their request during their
 
01:47:37.199 --> 01:47:38.390 align:start position:0%
and that was their request during their
presentation

01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
though there are three different
 
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.189 align:start position:0%
though there are three different
entities

01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh the department of revenue the
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
department of state and the department
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
of natural cultural resources
 
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
again no impact to those agency budget
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
lines because it's already been budgeted
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
in their transfer lines appropriately
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
a representative emerick moves the
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
administrative services errata sheet for
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
the technical corrections representative
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
emmerich seconds is there any
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
conversation questions represent walls
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
and lba nancy you're going to answer
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%

thank you so they're
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
what is the effect really on das and
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
their spending so this is 600 000 of
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
general funds it's coming back to them
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
do they get to spend it to make some of
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
that 15 cut or was that oh yes they do
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%

ah
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
this is called the additional need from
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
das and this is long and i'm just seeing
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
this now
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
mr clerk
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
i have to apologize to the division for
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
being an hour late this morning i had to
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
go to a meeting with the speaker and the
 
01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.870 align:start position:0%
go to a meeting with the speaker and the
governor

01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
but i know that representative emerick
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
did an absolutely magnificent job while
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
and represented burj wants to know we
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
need emotion that reverse of immigrant
 
01:49:59.589 --> 01:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
did a magnificent job
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:06.470 align:start position:0%
 
nancy

01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
nancy
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
i know you worked like a yeoman on this
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
one as well so
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to turn it over to you i will
 
01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:14.470 align:start position:0%
i'm going to turn it over to you i will
say

01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of things that we
 
01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
found in the das budget
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
one of them was the errata sheet we just
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
took care of
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
the other one was at cyber security
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
which they've been paying to the tune of
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
600 000
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
was supposed to been transferred over to
 
01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:33.910 align:start position:0%
was supposed to been transferred over to
doit

01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
doit
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
because it hits every agency and every
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
branch so it's not just the executive
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
branch but also the judicial branch so
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
we've made those question that we've
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
made those changes
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
and we are working now to restore
 
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
admin services to where they would have
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
been if they'd made the same amount of
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
cuts as everybody else but not had to
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
cut so many people because of the
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
mistakes in the budget so nancy if you
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
will walk us through it please
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
sure madam chair the what you have in
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
are 20 pages thank you mike for
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
stringing these together because they
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
were 20 separate documents
 
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
and these restore the 20 positions
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
that the agency specified
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
as having been unfunded
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
in their budget it's you would find it
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
on the last page page 18
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
of the agency's
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
budget presentation
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
and this is just all the backup for
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
every one of those items
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
the only change that we made at the
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
agency's request from what you saw
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
was i believe um
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's the very first request their very
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
first prioritized need
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
which is a new position
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
it is not um it was included in their
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
request but it was not um unfunded it
 
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
was a new position for an administrator
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
to handle the five different attached
 
01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:03.030 align:start position:0%
to handle the five different attached
boards

01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
boards
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
that have been
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
put into the department's budget
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
and so you'll see that as priority
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
number one and the reason you're seeing
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
priorities here is because subsequent to
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
their presentation to the division
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
they did provide our office with a
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
ranking for each one of the bundles if
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
you recall they issued i believe it was
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
fixed bundled and they were a buy
 
01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:28.149 align:start position:0%
fixed bundled and they were a buy
um

01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
category whether it was procurement
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
public works personnel
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
audit or the commissioner's office and
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
the budget office and subsequent to
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
their presentation
 
01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:40.229 align:start position:0%
their presentation
um

01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
given that the um
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
the division was interested in the
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
positions they supplied priorities for
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
each position individually and so that's
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
why you see a priority number in order
 
01:52:54.070 --> 01:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
for each position and the reference to
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
the bundle that they had originally
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
so a very long-winded way of saying
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
these are the 20 positions in priority
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
order and their impact on the budget
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
several of these
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
are shared i'm sorry have a mixed
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
funding source so there would be um as
 
01:53:15.189 --> 01:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
you'll see an agency income piece so
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
that's not all general funds
 
01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
um a several of them are part-time and
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
not full-time
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
so um they're amount to small salaries
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
and benefits
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
but the net um
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
for all of these
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
was described um
 
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
prior to this so
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
these represent the restoration of
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
essentially 20 unfunded positions except
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
for the one new one so 19 unfunded and
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
if there are questions again i'm going
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
to let nancy
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
answer them represent walls
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so i've opened their bundles
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
and uh it was a total of about
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
approximately 1.3 million per year
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm losing this a little bit is this
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
600 000 through the biennium or 600 000
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
per year per year
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
so it's one
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
six and six twelve so it's most of what
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
their bundles were is what it sounds
 
01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:16.310 align:start position:0%
their bundles were is what it sounds
like

01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's everything
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's all of those positions that they
 
01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:22.229 align:start position:0%
it's all of those positions that they
identified

01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
identified
 
01:54:22.239 --> 01:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
identified
everything

01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's 600 000 per year and it was 1.3
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
million per year
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
that they showed on their bundles so it
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
sounds don't forget don't forget the 600
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
000 from cyber security that they also
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
were erroneously paid for so we had
 
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
their errata sheet
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
and then we had the other six hundred
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
thousand commissioner goulet is still
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
working on the details of that amendment
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
and i don't have it yet
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
so to be clear it looks like we are
 
01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:52.470 align:start position:0%
so to be clear it looks like we are
restoring

01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
restoring
 
01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
almost everything that were in their six
 
01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:56.390 align:start position:0%
almost everything that were in their six
bundles

01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
bundles
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
am i correct
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
yes for positions only these were just
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
the positions
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
and the agency is as the chair indicated
 
01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.430 align:start position:0%
and the agency is as the chair indicated
um

01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
going to be providing some language
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
cyber security piece
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
and we are also working on a possible
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
house bill one amendment
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
make these positions
 
01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:25.990 align:start position:0%
make these positions
um

01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
well i'll leave it at that this is the
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
das piece that we're talking about right
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
here so
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
they're funding um
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
keith is all is being worked on
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
so that we can provide the backup for
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
these funds
 
01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:48.080 align:start position:0%

all right representative um
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
as paul said 2001 we were merged
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
administratively with ps
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
but the enabling statute required that
 
01:59:16.639 --> 01:59:18.550 align:start position:0%
but the enabling statute required that
any

01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:20.310 align:start position:0%
any
existing

01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
existing
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
classified employees positions remain
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
classified employee positions
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
so we currently have six full-time
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
classified positions one of which is not
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
has not been uh is empty
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh the person retired and
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
that was the operations manager
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
and uh we we did a rehire and we did it
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
as a peas employee
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
we have four
 
01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:49.189 align:start position:0%
we have four
part-time

01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
01:59:49.199 --> 01:59:50.310 align:start position:0%
part-time
uh

01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:51.830 align:start position:0%
uh
year-round

01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
year-round
 
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
classified employees
 
01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:55.030 align:start position:0%
classified employees
uh

01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
again over the years through attrition
 
01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
as uh our harbour masters
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
our part-time harbour masters were
 
02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:02.790 align:start position:0%
our part-time harbour masters were
leaving

02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh we hired we hired harbor masters as
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
uh as pda employees
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
so what you see in front of you is is
 
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
basically the
 
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
the pay for those employees and and with
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
the full-time ones the benefits
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
but i think it's important uh to say
 
02:00:21.199 --> 02:00:22.709 align:start position:0%
but i think it's important uh to say
that

02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
they're paid
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
their pay comes out of the classified
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
system and the check checks are cut cut
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
but we reimburse
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
the general fund for these payments for
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
these folks
 
02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.390 align:start position:0%
these folks
payroll

02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
in the end there is no net effect on
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
general fund revenues
 
02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:46.310 align:start position:0%
general fund revenues
right

02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
and soon i would imagine at some point
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
future i don't know how far in the
 
02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:52.390 align:start position:0%
future i don't know how far in the
future

02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
everybody will be a peas employee and
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
not no longer a state employee right
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
well this is this there's one little
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
thing that we're trying to work through
 
02:01:03.669 --> 02:01:03.679 align:start position:0%
and that is that two of those positions
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
by statute are required to be police
 
02:01:06.239 --> 02:01:07.350 align:start position:0%
by statute are required to be police
officers

02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
officers
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
certified by pstc
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
and they're in group two
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
um group two retirement
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh so we're trying to have some
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
discussions on
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
how that could work
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
with the legal authority that peace has
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
so we've got some discussions going on
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:01:27.199 --> 02:01:28.229 align:start position:0%
with that

advance

02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
advance
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
i mean i just it to me it
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
the words don't work and i well they're
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
stuck with whatever das gives them for a
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
a class line so
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know what gene's got in there i
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
mean we're talking about 220 dollars but
 
02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:30.550 align:start position:0%
mean we're talking about 220 dollars but
it's

02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
they don't have any
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
choice over what those are called
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
and and if i may madam chair the i mean
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
is classifieds
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
the scale is in is in the book and it's
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
a step system so right what they do is
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
this is again this is i'm not
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
a finance guy but what they do is they
 
02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
look at the step system and they know
 
02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
who's up for the next step and then they
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
have the
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
um increases that that are required
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
until our annual increases the cost of
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
living increases and so that's that's
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
how some of these numbers get uh
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
increased over over the period of time
 
02:04:19.199 --> 02:04:22.229 align:start position:0%
increased over over the period of time
yeah

02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:23.840 align:start position:0%

sheet if you can bring it up
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%

02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%

justice sheet in front of you and we can
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
and is it large enough
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's got a lot of roads
 
02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
it looks like they moved
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know what they did with the
 
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
money they just moved some stuff out
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
well when they came in they uh talked
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
about an irs
 
02:06:34.239 --> 02:06:36.950 align:start position:0%
about an irs
um

02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
problem that they identified
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
the uh the medical investigators as
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
employees where the state had been
 
02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
treating them as contractors yeah
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
so the department of justice challenged
 
02:06:51.119 --> 02:06:52.310 align:start position:0%
so the department of justice challenged
that

02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
and the irs reversed their positions so
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
now the department of justice can treat
 
02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:00.229 align:start position:0%
now the department of justice can treat
these

02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
investigators as contractors
 
02:07:05.589 --> 02:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
so they're moving the appropriations
 
02:07:05.599 --> 02:07:06.709 align:start position:0%
so they're moving the appropriations
from

02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
class lines that would be
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
employees in for example 14 and then
 
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
further down you see quite a bit in
 
02:07:18.069 --> 02:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
class 50
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
and the benefit lines and they're moving
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
that into the contracts for program
 
02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
services line
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
there's no general fund impact it's just
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
a small adjustment at the bottom from
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
one source of funds to another less than
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
less than ten thousand dollars involved
 
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:48.400 align:start position:0%

02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
this was when the
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
department of labor was in
 
02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:01.430 align:start position:0%
department of labor was in
and

02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
nancy pointed out that there was a
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
drafting error at the very end of
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
section 127 and that last sentence
 
02:10:10.229 --> 02:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
was new
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
right so rather than having it lost in
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
the shuffle i asked legislative services
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
just to fix it now
 
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't have to keep track of it
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
as a technical correction at the end of
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
the process
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
works for me
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
and we all approve this with that
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
language in it so
 
02:10:31.550 --> 02:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
um i will move to approve amendment
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
202106 87h representative emmerich

any questions on this
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
see none if you could call the role
 
02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%

that's
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
i think i need four more pairs of hands
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
not two more pairs of hands i need
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
my husband always maintains he just
 
02:11:26.550 --> 02:11:26.560 align:start position:0%

02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:27.750 align:start position:0%
needs to clone himself to get everything
done

02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh mike
 
02:11:37.550 --> 02:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
is amendment
 
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
2021 0695
 
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%

02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it is yes
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
okay let's
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
look at that because at least all of us
 
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
read hb 281 when it was the floor of the
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
house so although it's several pages
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
long here
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
we've had a bite at the apple already we
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
passed it last
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%

02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
at the request
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
of chairman
 
02:12:30.310 --> 02:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
norman major and vice chairman patrick
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
abrami this bill passed on the floor of
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
the house so it is the house
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
position and this is exactly what you
 
02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:39.189 align:start position:0%
position and this is exactly what you
saw

02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
saw
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
on the floor of the house
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
what it does
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
is on the
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
last page
 
02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:49.750 align:start position:0%
last page
um

02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
it suspends the effective date
 
02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
until january 2026
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
of the single sales factor
 
02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:00.470 align:start position:0%
of the single sales factor
apportionment

02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
and we were asked to put this into hb2
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
as a new section because of house
 
02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:16.709 align:start position:0%
as a new section because of house
approved

02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
buy the house
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
so i would move the adoption of
 
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
amendment two zero two one o six nine
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
five h

02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
i love it when you've had something two
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
or three weeks ago to read so now we're
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
not all fumbling with something we
 
02:13:52.629 --> 02:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
sir clerk if you could call the role i
 
02:13:56.069 --> 02:13:56.079 align:start position:0%

02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
i did not alleviate my need for four
 
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%

okay

02:15:03.589 --> 02:15:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
we're still waiting for nancy on that
 
02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:11.750 align:start position:0%
we're still waiting for nancy on that
one

02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay i want to go to section 53
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%

hog
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
and keep all these
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
which would mean somebody else gets some
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
of my paper there's yours
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
there's mine
 
02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
this believe it or not is a relatively
 
02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:53.030 align:start position:0%
this believe it or not is a relatively
easy

02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
easy
 
02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
cut in the budget of a small amount but
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
since we have fewer revenue dollars
 
02:15:59.830 --> 02:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
than we have other things we're looking
 
02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
on page 25.
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday commissioner caswell talked
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
about wanting to hire
 
02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
a new staff member
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
the director of intergovernmental
 
02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:15.109 align:start position:0%
the director of intergovernmental
affairs

02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
that position is currently empty
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
and this relates to the job
 
02:16:24.629 --> 02:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
and what this amendment does
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
is it says yes you can hire that person
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
but it takes effect january 1
 
02:16:30.159 --> 02:16:31.669 align:start position:0%
but it takes effect january 1
2023

02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
2023
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
so it pushes
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
much of the expenditure out of this
 
02:16:35.359 --> 02:16:36.629 align:start position:0%
much of the expenditure out of this
biennium

02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
into the last six months of the year and
 
02:16:41.669 --> 02:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully by then everything will turn
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
around and we'll have more revenue on
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
the other hand
 
02:16:45.359 --> 02:16:46.870 align:start position:0%
the other hand
if

02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
things turn around faster than ways and
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
means things this is an easy change for
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
the senate to make if they end up with a
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
lot more money than we have so i've left
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
everything the way it is said yeah you
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
can have this position but we're not
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
going to fund it until the last six
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:17.709 --> 02:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
representative emerick adopts amendment
 
02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
2021-0738 and moves to adopt
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
0738h representative emerick
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
we ended up with a lot more money
 
02:17:35.509 --> 02:17:35.519 align:start position:0%
but if we don't this is an easy cut
 
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
position isn't there anyway we'll just
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
save a few dollars
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
madam chair does nancy know how much

02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%

about that we haven't
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh was
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
did anthony finish that amendment with
 
02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
ken mayfield's change on the due process
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
um i haven't seen that yet from oh
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
actually i emailed you something
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday i believe but i was up here
 
02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:22.070 align:start position:0%
yesterday i believe but i was up here
yesterday

02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:22.790 align:start position:0%
yesterday
ken

02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
ken
 
02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh marifield
 
02:21:28.389 --> 02:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
his people were looking at
 
02:21:28.399 --> 02:21:29.750 align:start position:0%
his people were looking at
it

02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
in more depth i guess that was anthony's
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
proposed change to his language
 
02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i i did send you anthony's proposed
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
change but then later i heard from ken
 
02:21:39.439 --> 02:21:41.910 align:start position:0%
change but then later i heard from ken
merrifield

02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
merrifield
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
who asked if
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
he asked his hearing officer to look at
 
02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
the language
 
02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:48.790 align:start position:0%
the language
and

02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
i did hear from representative walsh
 
02:21:53.349 --> 02:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
that she was interested in what ken
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
merrifield was going to provide
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
well until that amendment's ready to be
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
released it can't be released and i
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
guess anthony
 
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
held it up with ken's whole
 
02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:05.830 align:start position:0%
held it up with ken's whole
permission

02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
permission
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
that could
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
be i do you can't release that right now
 
02:22:12.319 --> 02:22:13.830 align:start position:0%
be i do you can't release that right now
okay

02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
um it can we go to page
 
02:22:16.479 --> 02:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
um it can we go to page
62

02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
62
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
and look at the dnc changes it's not
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
clear to me
 
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
which ones generate revenue
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
and which ones do not generate revenue
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
commissioners spoke about this briefly
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
but then even when i read it later i
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't positive
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
man and chair are you 62 in hb1 or hb2
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.830 --> 02:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
now let me see if that's
 
02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
142 six on page 62
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
which is at the bottom of the page
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner briefly discussed
 
02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:13.190 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner briefly discussed
this

02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
mike can you run us through this i mean
 
02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:23.190 align:start position:0%
mike can you run us through this i mean
it

02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:23:25.270 --> 02:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it looks like it's existing
 
02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:28.150 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it looks like it's existing
language

02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
and chair
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
these are
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
these are appropriations for essentially
 
02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
park projects
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
that they're hoping to generate
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
additional revenue for
 
02:23:44.550 --> 02:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
in campgrounds upgrading the uh the rv
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
what the revenue is nancy
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
they did not supply i don't believe they
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
supplied any revenue associated with
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
with these items i'd have to go back and
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
look at
 
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
reason that explains why i couldn't find
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
it in here
 
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i i remember her discussing
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
it um as being you know
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
particularly in hampton
 
02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:11.349 align:start position:0%
particularly in hampton
um

02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
at the hampton rv park that they could
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
fill those
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
rather quickly
 
02:24:20.309 --> 02:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
and same at jericho mountain but
 
02:24:22.630 --> 02:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
additional revenue i don't know if they
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
supplied anything to that effect
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
and as written this is a general fund
 
02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:30.389 align:start position:0%
and as written this is a general fund
appropriation

02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
right but she did tell us we were
 
02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'd have to go back and look at their
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
presentation in more detail i don't
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
think it was in the presentation i had
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
the presentation at home and then i
 
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
tried to read this online
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
and i couldn't find it when i was
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
reading hb2 online when i was home
 
02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
right and you know these are
 
02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
essentially capital appropriations as
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
well but
 
02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
okay what do we have in the in the
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
budget hb2 last year
 
02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.990 align:start position:0%
budget hb2 last year
for

02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
fort stark because it seems to me this
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
has gone to 615 000
 
02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i thought i remembered something
 
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
smaller that perhaps
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
the senate took out
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
in 2019 there was a house bill two
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
the thrift which was the
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
number of one-time projects
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
and it was deleted during the process i
 
02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly when
 
02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
or i believe the amount was around 400
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
or 350 000 i'd have to double check that
 
02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
but it did drop out during the process
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and we put it in in the house but i
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
think this is double what they asked for
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
i think you are right about that i can
 
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
um verify that
 
02:25:49.590 --> 02:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
so if i can it
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
she said starting on line nine now i'm
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
on page sixty three
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
the sum of sixty six hundred fifty five
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
thousand for the purpose of
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
redevelopment improvement projects at
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
jericho mountain beach area campground
 
02:26:06.309 --> 02:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
including the rv dump station two new
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
pit toilets ten campsites four camping
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
cabins extension water facilities etc
 
02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
she said that section would bring in
 
02:26:16.479 --> 02:26:17.590 align:start position:0%
she said that section would bring in
revenue

02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:19.750 align:start position:0%
revenue
yes

02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:26:22.469 --> 02:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
recall that she discussed that as
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
being a very popular area and that they
 
02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:25.670 align:start position:0%
being a very popular area and that they
could

02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
generate revenue with the addition of
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
those projects but we don't have a level
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
of detail for that
 
02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can figure out
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
which one she does she didn't say
 
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
there'd be any revenue for fort stark
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
what about the hampton rv park is she
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
getting did she say additional revenue
 
02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:47.270 align:start position:0%
getting did she say additional revenue
there

02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure about that because it's
 
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
essentially an upgrade of the system
 
02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:52.630 align:start position:0%
essentially an upgrade of the system
so

02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what revenue could be
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
attributable to that
 
02:26:59.190 --> 02:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
if the lights exist now it's just an
 
02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
upgrade to the amperage
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
did she say
 
02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:05.349 align:start position:0%
did she say
that

02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
rvs were bypassing them because they
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't use the electricity
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
they are they are obsolete it's my
 
02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:13.750 align:start position:0%
they are they are obsolete it's my
understanding

02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that means they're
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
being bypassed
 
02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:17.830 align:start position:0%
being bypassed
but

02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
certainly they could charge additional
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
can you find out for us
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
for each of these sections
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
if there is additional revenue and if
 
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
yes what they think it is going to be
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
and can you also ask her why fort stark
 
02:27:42.309 --> 02:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
has gone up so much more than it was two
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
i know construction has
 
02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:47.990 align:start position:0%
i know construction has
increased

02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
increased
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
but a 50 percent increase in
 
02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
construction costs in two years seems to
 
02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
be a little high
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i can certainly touch base with her
 
02:27:59.910 --> 02:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if appropriate to
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
mention but i'm not certain that the
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
increased revenue is not going to be
 
02:28:07.270 --> 02:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
within the park fund either and not
 
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
general funds no it'd be in the park
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
fund but if she's making more money for
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
the parks then she can afford to pay for
 
02:28:14.319 --> 02:28:15.670 align:start position:0%
the parks then she can afford to pay for
more

02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking for general revenue now
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
she would spend that on the parks
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
but she's asking as i understand this
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
for general fund dollars to upgrade the
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
park so did i misread that
 
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
no these are
 
02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
okay i didn't misread that
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
no you did not
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
well you'll find that out for us and
 
02:28:49.990 --> 02:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
then we have
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
the page page 64
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page 64.
 
02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
we have a section section 145
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:10.230 --> 02:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
and we need to repeal this nancy can you
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
speak to this
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
section 145. no one's 146 i'm sorry
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
or mike i don't know who wants to talk
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
to you this is the doj
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
02:29:31.270 --> 02:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
02:29:33.429 --> 02:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit odd drafting because
 
02:29:33.439 --> 02:29:35.030 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit odd drafting because
145

02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
145
 
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
is the body worn cameras
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
146 is in the middle of another section
 
02:29:44.309 --> 02:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
that relates to the body worn cameras
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
but 146
 
02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
is a repeal
 
02:29:50.469 --> 02:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
of a commission
 
02:29:55.510 --> 02:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:58.870 --> 02:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i believe
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
i always get tripped up because these
 
02:30:04.309 --> 02:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
sections are out of order
 
02:30:07.270 --> 02:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
i think these are standard
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is standard language going back to
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
line 13
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
when when
 
02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
legislative services drafts
 
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
the commission you'll see on line 33
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
that they have a report due november 1st
 
02:30:23.590 --> 02:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
2021 and then the commission effectively
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
is repealed on the same date or day
 
02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:29.830 align:start position:0%
is repealed on the same date or day
later

02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
02:30:33.510 --> 02:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
how they handle commissions
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:30:36.479 --> 02:30:37.270 align:start position:0%
so that
um

02:30:37.270 --> 02:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
they don't go on forever
 
02:30:44.469 --> 02:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
well if you do they they submit a report
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
a chaptered study that goes out of
 
02:30:59.270 --> 02:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
existence because it's in chapter law
 
02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
these are in statute these are statutory
 
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.270 align:start position:0%
these are in statute these are statutory
commissions

02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
and i believe this kind of language was
 
02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
developed several years ago
 
02:31:07.280 --> 02:31:08.309 align:start position:0%
developed several years ago
to

02:31:08.309 --> 02:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
clean up the books as it were so that
 
02:31:13.270 --> 02:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
these kinds of commissions don't
 
02:31:16.150 --> 02:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
continue on ad infinitum okay so we
 
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
could just approve this
 
02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
section to clean up the commission
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
language yes
 
02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:23.190 align:start position:0%
language yes
well

02:31:23.190 --> 02:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
if you flip to page 65
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
section 148 makes an appropriation for
 
02:31:33.190 --> 02:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
so you may want to look at all the
 
02:31:36.870 --> 02:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
sections together
 
02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
what section is that
 
02:31:51.270 --> 02:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
so it's a five hundred thousand dollar
 
02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:58.230 align:start position:0%
so it's a five hundred thousand dollar
appropriation

02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:09.270 --> 02:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
so they effectively go out of commission
 
02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:18.950 align:start position:0%
so they effectively go out of commission
literally

02:32:18.950 --> 02:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
literally
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
in 2021 and then they get an
 
02:32:20.479 --> 02:32:27.270 align:start position:0%
in 2021 and then they get an
appropriation

02:32:27.270 --> 02:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
well that appropriation
 
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:36.710 align:start position:0%

one to to balance their budget we just
 
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:25.520 align:start position:0%

what they had for house bill 2 paperwork
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
when they came into the division yep and
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's much clearer and they're asking to
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
delete some unnecessary sections
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%

section 58 which is one of ours
 
02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
and section 58 which is on page 26 as i
 
02:36:57.760 --> 02:36:58.950 align:start position:0%
and section 58 which is on page 26 as i
said

02:36:58.950 --> 02:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
has a one-line change
 
02:37:03.750 --> 02:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
and what it does is the existing law
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
says any of which equipment purchase in
 
02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
excess of five thousand dollars they
 
02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
want to scratch five thousand dollars
 
02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
and they want to replace that with the
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
approval threshold for contracts set by
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
the governor and council manual of
 
02:37:19.270 --> 02:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
procedures and i believe they changed
 
02:37:21.429 --> 02:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
that a few years ago to ten thousand
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
dollars and so they're trying to bring
 
02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
this up i don't see any problem with
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
approving this section so that it
 
02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
matches what's in the manual does it
 
02:37:35.349 --> 02:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative emerick moves to approve

represent walls
 
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um it looks like
 
02:37:48.630 --> 02:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
my first reaction is we should make this
 
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
permanent so we don't have to do this
 
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
annually and it looks like it is that
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's amending the rsa and that's right
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%

02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
morning that the unobligated balance is
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
less than 200 000
 
02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
so my original thought had been if it
 
02:39:51.030 --> 02:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
was closer over a million or something
 
02:39:52.630 --> 02:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
we would cut it because we had to make
 
02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
some cuts since it's only down to less
 
02:39:57.190 --> 02:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
than two hundred thousand dollars i
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
frankly think we should just to prove it
 
02:40:01.510 --> 02:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
move this on does anybody have any other
 
02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:08.870 align:start position:0%
move this on does anybody have any other
thoughts

from his sprint across over to
 
02:41:55.200 --> 02:41:56.309 align:start position:0%

02:41:58.950 --> 02:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes i took the subway from the lob to
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
the state house
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
way to go all right if you can bring up
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
what we just got from doj and we're
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at page
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
65 basically
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
um section
 
02:42:16.230 --> 02:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
150 on line 31 and mike's going to bring
 
02:42:17.830 --> 02:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
up a document
 
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
that they have just printed
 
02:42:22.309 --> 02:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
and grade and scat and
 
02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
scratch through what they don't want and
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
he's going to walk us
 
02:42:33.269 --> 02:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm on page three of the letter
 
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
and at the bottom of that page you'll
 
02:42:41.750 --> 02:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
see the statement that the language
 
02:42:44.469 --> 02:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
strikeouts on the attached document are
 
02:42:46.870 --> 02:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
requested to remove from house
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
be removed from house bill 2 is
 
02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:50.389 align:start position:0%
be removed from house bill 2 is
introduced

02:42:50.389 --> 02:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
02:42:53.110 --> 02:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
and the request is to keep
 
02:42:55.349 --> 02:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
the remaining text for the
 
02:42:57.269 --> 02:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
medical examiner and director of
 
02:42:58.790 --> 02:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
diversity outreach
 
02:43:01.349 --> 02:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
positions and as i understand this this
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
go along with that house bill 1
 
02:43:08.710 --> 02:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
amendment to um
 
02:43:11.429 --> 02:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
restore the previous
 
02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
language regarding the medical examiners
 
02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:17.590 align:start position:0%
language regarding the medical examiners
because

02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
since the irs is no longer pursuing this
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
they can pay them as contractors
 
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
and this email was copied to the
 
02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
the budget director was included so um
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear any resistance from from
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
that office
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
so this basically
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
goes along with that house bill 1
 
02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:43.910 align:start position:0%
goes along with that house bill 1
cleanup

02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
so if we
 
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
move on to
 
02:43:48.870 --> 02:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
page i don't know if these pages are
 
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
numbered but 65 of house bill 2
 
02:43:56.070 --> 02:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
they're asking to strike
 
02:44:06.150 --> 02:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
which would have authorized an
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
so since they are
 
02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:14.870 align:start position:0%
so since they are
paying

02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
paying
 
02:44:16.870 --> 02:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
these people as contractors they don't
 
02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
need to establish that position
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
that looks like language that would have
 
02:44:42.389 --> 02:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
for certain investigations which would
 
02:44:50.469 --> 02:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
and then submitting claims
 
02:44:54.309 --> 02:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:44:56.230 --> 02:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
an unclassified position would have been
 
02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
on salary and wouldn't have
 
02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
155 is being eliminated that would have
 
02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
established a deputy chief
 
02:45:08.479 --> 02:45:09.830 align:start position:0%
established a deputy chief
uh

02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's plural so more than one definite
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:19.279 --> 02:45:31.349 align:start position:0%
 
156.

02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:31.359 --> 02:45:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
not

02:45:33.030 --> 02:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not either but if they don't want it
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's about cremation of human remains so
 
02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
they're in charge of that
 
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
and they were making some changes to the
 
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
law that i guess they've decided they
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't need
 
02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:57.110 align:start position:0%
don't need
correct

02:45:57.110 --> 02:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:59.670 --> 02:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
so basically mike if i have this from
 
02:46:02.710 --> 02:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
their document that we just all just got
 
02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
and we've been looking at with you
 
02:46:07.830 --> 02:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
yes you could make a an amendment
 
02:46:11.269 --> 02:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully one not four but to delete
 
02:46:11.279 --> 02:46:12.710 align:start position:0%
hopefully one not four but to delete
section

02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:46:12.720 --> 02:46:14.469 align:start position:0%
section
151

02:46:14.469 --> 02:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
151
 
02:46:14.479 --> 02:46:16.230 align:start position:0%
151
154

02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
154
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
155 and 156
 
02:46:21.510 --> 02:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
02:46:24.389 --> 02:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
exactly what i asked ols for
 
02:46:24.399 --> 02:46:26.550 align:start position:0%
exactly what i asked ols for
okay

02:46:26.550 --> 02:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:39.910 --> 02:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
152 and 153
 
02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
all dealing with
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:49.590 --> 02:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
and i guess i'd hang on to the other two
 
02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
for a minute because if we get
 
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
real crunch time trying to cut
 
02:46:56.950 --> 02:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
positions the easy thing is to push
 
02:46:58.870 --> 02:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
those out rather than cut them so they
 
02:47:00.870 --> 02:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
don't hire them right away to save a few
 
02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:03.990 align:start position:0%
don't hire them right away to save a few
bucks

02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:04.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:47:04.830 --> 02:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
let's could i have a motion to approve
 
02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:08.630 align:start position:0%
let's could i have a motion to approve
section

02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:10.790 align:start position:0%
section
150

02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:28.230 align:start position:0%
all right
so

02:48:28.230 --> 02:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:30.630 --> 02:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
let me talk to you about
 
02:48:32.790 --> 02:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
the small business development center
 
02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
and i don't right now have
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
an amendment for that
 
02:48:40.150 --> 02:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
i think each of us has been flooded with
 
02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:41.349 align:start position:0%
i think each of us has been flooded with
emails

02:48:41.349 --> 02:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
emails
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
saying that they were cut
 
02:48:45.990 --> 02:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
eight hundred and four and eighty
 
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars over the course of a
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
biennium and they couldn't exist without
 
02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:52.630 align:start position:0%
biennium and they couldn't exist without
that

02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:48:54.790 --> 02:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
so what the governor had originally done
 
02:48:56.500 --> 02:48:56.510 align:start position:0%
was put fifty thousand
 
02:48:56.510 --> 02:48:57.670 align:start position:0%
was put fifty thousand
[Music]

02:48:57.670 --> 02:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:00.309 align:start position:0%
[Music]
into

02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure where the figure that we've
 
02:49:10.389 --> 02:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
been getting in our emails came from
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
well the cuts of 440 000
 
02:49:15.429 --> 02:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
in each of the two years
 
02:49:18.630 --> 02:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at the budget
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
they were they max they have been
 
02:49:26.230 --> 02:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
authorized in the budget is 315 000.
 
02:49:28.469 --> 02:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:49:30.309 --> 02:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
a hundred and twenty five thousand less
 
02:49:32.230 --> 02:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
than what we're being told
 
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
was in the budget
 
02:49:36.550 --> 02:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
i talked to the governor's budget
 
02:49:38.230 --> 02:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
director this morning
 
02:49:40.309 --> 02:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
and i told him we were going to transfer
 
02:49:42.070 --> 02:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
money out of the
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tourism line
 
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
and we were going to fund
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
small business development center
 
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
at 225
 
02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:53.670 align:start position:0%
at 225
000

02:49:53.670 --> 02:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the first year and 225 000 in the
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
second year representative leishman you
 
02:50:00.950 --> 02:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
found that what was the amount of money
 
02:50:02.710 --> 02:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
they actually spent
 
02:50:06.070 --> 02:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
in 2020 madam chair was 166
 
02:50:12.469 --> 02:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
000 and change so in 2020 the small
 
02:50:15.230 --> 02:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
business development center spent
 
02:50:17.670 --> 02:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
166 000
 
02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
of state funding
 
02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly what they will
 
02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:23.670 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly what they will
spend

02:50:23.670 --> 02:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
spend
 
02:50:26.710 --> 02:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
in 21 because that year is ongoing
 
02:50:28.870 --> 02:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
but we're proposing i'm going to propose
 
02:50:30.910 --> 02:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment to give them
 
02:50:33.190 --> 02:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
225 000
 
02:50:35.429 --> 02:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
in each of two years
 
02:50:37.510 --> 02:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's not quite as much as they got in
 
02:50:39.349 --> 02:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
the last biennium
 
02:50:41.750 --> 02:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
but you we've seen state agency after
 
02:50:44.070 --> 02:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
state agency come in and say
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
my spending level in general funds is
 
02:50:48.309 --> 02:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
down twelve percent or five percent or
 
02:50:51.030 --> 02:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
four percent depending on the size of
 
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
their unit so i do think we all wanted
 
02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
to give them money and we wanted to give
 
02:50:59.349 --> 02:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
them reasonable money to go forward and
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
this is going to require some belt
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
tightening but the state's doing some
 
02:51:05.190 --> 02:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
belt tightening and hopefully we'll have
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:12.230 --> 02:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
it seemed like
 
02:51:17.190 --> 02:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:21.349 --> 02:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
nancy is that you with your hand up
 
02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
it is me madam chair with my hand up and
 
02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:26.550 align:start position:0%
it is me madam chair with my hand up and
um

02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
i wish it said nancy and
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
lavenas figure that out by the time we
 
02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
meet again actually i sign on with mike
 
02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:34.070 align:start position:0%
meet again actually i sign on with mike
hoffman's

02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
hoffman's
 
02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
name so it'd be confusing if they're
 
02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:37.110 align:start position:0%
name so it'd be confusing if they're
like

02:51:37.110 --> 02:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:51:40.469 --> 02:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
you you guys share a license don't you
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
we do
 
02:51:44.309 --> 02:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's it so that's why and
 
02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
and um so this is a little less than i
 
02:51:48.790 --> 02:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
originally thought but when i found out
 
02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
how much money they really were budgeted
 
02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what we were sent
 
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's what i think we'll do there's a
 
02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion because they did
 
02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
receive an appropriation late
 
02:52:03.110 --> 02:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the budget process last
 
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
session um in-house bill 2 of 125 000 in
 
02:52:09.510 --> 02:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
each fiscal year
 
02:52:11.750 --> 02:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
well maybe by the time we get done the
 
02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
senate they can raise that right so
 
02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's why that you see that 100
 
02:52:19.830 --> 02:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
number floating around well i want to
 
02:52:21.429 --> 02:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
give them something i wanted to keep
 
02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
going i think we all do and i think
 
02:52:25.510 --> 02:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're cognizant of how much money we're
 
02:52:28.469 --> 02:52:28.479 align:start position:0%
having to cut
 
02:52:29.910 --> 02:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
02:52:34.469 --> 02:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:37.110 --> 02:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
all right i think now we're still
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have anything else
 
02:52:40.870 --> 02:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
lba do you have anything that we should
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
have discussed that we haven't
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
for the agencies i mean we've still got
 
02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
some agencies that are coming in we have
 
02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
the national guard coming in
 
02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have liquor at two
 
02:52:53.349 --> 02:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
o'clock the public hearing by the way i
 
02:52:55.269 --> 02:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
think you all got to notice
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
is next tuesday starting at one o'clock
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's zoom
 
02:53:02.550 --> 02:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
i think that division one will meet
 
02:53:05.830 --> 02:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
tuesday morning i told ken
 
02:53:07.670 --> 02:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
that then what i'm going to do is drive
 
02:53:09.670 --> 02:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
home and zoom from the house because i
 
02:53:11.750 --> 02:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
think that could go on quite a while and
 
02:53:13.630 --> 02:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to stay up here in room
 
02:53:16.630 --> 02:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
202 at least at home if i need a snack i
 
02:53:19.830 --> 02:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
can run down and get a snack
 
02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
watch my cats try to upset my monitor
 
02:53:27.269 --> 02:53:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to be then if nobody
 
02:53:31.830 --> 02:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
has anything nancy your hand is still up
 
02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:32.710 align:start position:0%
has anything nancy your hand is still up
or

02:53:32.710 --> 02:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:53:34.710 --> 02:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
up again
 
02:53:37.030 --> 02:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
no it is not up again it will be down
 
02:53:39.590 --> 02:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
momentarily okay
 
02:53:42.070 --> 02:53:42.080 align:start position:0%

opportunity to provide you an overview
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the liquor commission's fy 2223
 
02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
and just
 
02:55:35.910 --> 02:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
to let you know that the commission is
 
02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
very mindful of our statutory
 
02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility to optimize revenue for
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
while at the same time maintaining
 
02:55:46.790 --> 02:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
controls and improving efficiencies of
 
02:55:48.309 --> 02:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
our business
 
02:55:51.429 --> 02:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
we feel that the 2223 budget supports
 
02:55:54.070 --> 02:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
the level of funding that will allow us
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
to maintain safe operations
 
02:55:59.269 --> 02:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
while returning maximum revenue to the
 
02:56:01.030 --> 02:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
just quickly
 
02:56:04.230 --> 02:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
the two areas of the budget that i would
 
02:56:06.070 --> 02:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
like to bring to your attention is the
 
02:56:07.750 --> 02:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
first is staffing
 
02:56:10.790 --> 02:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
the funds associated with our positions
 
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
is 56 percent of our budget
 
02:56:16.469 --> 02:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
and even at this level the commission
 
02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
operates with a very
 
02:56:21.429 --> 02:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
very lean full-time labor force and what
 
02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
i would consider a robust part-time
 
02:56:25.269 --> 02:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
labor force
 
02:56:27.750 --> 02:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
the second is the funding necessary to
 
02:56:29.590 --> 02:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
implement and maintain
 
02:56:33.349 --> 02:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
the new next gen d6 365
 
02:56:36.150 --> 02:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
software platform to support our new
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
point of sale and back office financial
 
02:56:41.429 --> 02:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
systems that are currently scheduled to
 
02:56:44.150 --> 02:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
go live at the end of this year
 
02:56:46.230 --> 02:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
and at this point madam chair i would
 
02:56:49.510 --> 02:56:49.520 align:start position:0%

equipment in our rooms it exchanges all
 
02:57:47.429 --> 02:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
the air five times an hour
 
02:57:49.269 --> 02:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
takes out all those nasty covered
 
02:57:51.750 --> 02:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
particles and everything else but it's a
 
02:57:53.590 --> 02:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
wee tiny bit noisy
 
02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:54.469 align:start position:0%
wee tiny bit noisy

uh
 
02:58:04.469 --> 02:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
so the liquor fund is self-funded
 
02:58:06.389 --> 02:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
our budget is a separate liquor fund
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
outside of the general fund and no
 
02:58:10.389 --> 02:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriations are used to
 
02:58:12.309 --> 02:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
maintain our operations
 
02:58:14.389 --> 02:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
the commission operates 69 retail
 
02:58:17.590 --> 02:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
outlets nine state owned and 60 leased
 
02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
they generated over 617 million in net
 
02:58:22.870 --> 02:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
retail sales in fy 20.
 
02:58:24.870 --> 02:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
product is shipped out of two warehouses
 
02:58:26.469 --> 02:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
one is state owned and the other is
 
02:58:28.870 --> 02:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
contracted with dhl
 
02:58:30.469 --> 02:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
liquor revenue is transferred to the
 
02:58:32.150 --> 02:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
general fund after deducting
 
02:58:34.230 --> 02:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
administrative costs and our transfers
 
02:58:35.990 --> 02:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
to the alcohol abuse prevention and
 
02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
treatment fund and the granted advantage
 
02:58:40.070 --> 02:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
health care trust fund
 
02:58:41.830 --> 02:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
beer tax and permit revenue is
 
02:58:43.830 --> 02:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
transferred in a separate line item to
 
02:58:45.190 --> 02:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
02:58:46.790 --> 02:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
and the budget
 
02:58:48.389 --> 02:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
presented is the level of funding
 
02:58:50.230 --> 02:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
necessary to support our revenue
 
02:58:52.150 --> 02:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
estimates and our mission to optimize
 
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state of new hampshire
 
02:58:57.429 --> 02:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
on page three we've provided the revenue
 
02:59:00.309 --> 02:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
trend and the transfer language there
 
02:59:02.150 --> 02:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
are two laws that govern liquor fund
 
02:59:04.389 --> 02:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
transfers the first is the five percent
 
02:59:05.990 --> 02:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
of previous year gross profit
 
02:59:07.830 --> 02:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
transferred to the alcohol abuse
 
02:59:09.910 --> 02:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
prevention and treatment fund and the
 
02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
second is the additional funds in the
 
02:59:13.750 --> 02:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
event of a shortfall in the granite
 
02:59:16.630 --> 02:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
advantage healthcare trust fund
 
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
on line one net revenue for fy 20 is a
 
02:59:21.389 --> 02:59:21.399 align:start position:0%
little over
 
02:59:24.630 --> 02:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
141.8 million and increases to a little
 
02:59:29.429 --> 02:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
over 149 million in fy 23.
 
02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
line 2 is the 5 transfer to hhs that
 
02:59:35.590 --> 02:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
starts at a little over 10 million in fy
 
02:59:38.230 --> 02:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
20 and increases to just under 11
 
02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
million in fy 23.
 
02:59:43.349 --> 02:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
on line three is the transfer to the
 
02:59:45.630 --> 02:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
general fund for fy 20 it was
 
02:59:47.670 --> 02:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
131.8 million
 
02:59:50.150 --> 02:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
the amount for fy21 is the amount that
 
02:59:51.670 --> 02:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
would have been transferred to the
 
02:59:53.590 --> 02:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
general fund if not for the additional
 
02:59:57.750 --> 02:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
funds requested by hhs and our fy 22 and
 
03:00:02.630 --> 03:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
23 are a little over 138 million
 
03:00:04.710 --> 03:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
on line 4 we've provided the revenue
 
03:00:06.230 --> 03:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
plan numbers
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
with line 5 showing the difference
 
03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
based on current trends the estimated
 
03:00:13.110 --> 03:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
transfer to the general fund for fy 22
 
03:00:17.510 --> 03:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
and 23 is 1.6 million and 2.1 million
 
03:00:20.070 --> 03:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
higher than the estimates currently in
 
03:00:20.080 --> 03:00:22.469 align:start position:0%
higher than the estimates currently in
hb1

03:00:22.469 --> 03:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
on line six is the additional 8.5
 
03:00:27.110 --> 03:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
million that's already been transferred
 
03:00:29.269 --> 03:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
to hhs this year for the shortfall in
 
03:00:30.790 --> 03:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
the granite advantage
 
03:00:32.710 --> 03:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
so this leaves a transfer to the general
 
03:00:34.830 --> 03:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
fund this year of approximately
 
03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
128.5 million
 
03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
line eight is beer tax which remains
 
03:00:42.309 --> 03:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
around 13 million and line nine is the
 
03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
total of the transfer to the general
 
03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:45.510 align:start position:0%
total of the transfer to the general
fund

03:00:45.510 --> 03:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:00:47.110 --> 03:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's also important to note that our
 
03:00:50.389 --> 03:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
expenses to net sale ratio is consistent
 
03:00:54.230 --> 03:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:56.790 --> 03:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
online i mean on page four
 
03:00:58.550 --> 03:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
we list out our major but we have a
 
03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
question yeah okay yeah thank you i'm
 
03:01:02.389 --> 03:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
sorry to interrupt you but i have a
 
03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
question regarding your alcohol abuse
 
03:01:07.750 --> 03:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
and prevention program uh do you have
 
03:01:10.870 --> 03:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
any data to su to support that it's been
 
03:01:13.510 --> 03:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
positive that it has a a good you know
 
03:01:15.830 --> 03:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
impact they just transfer the money they
 
03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't collect the data that's a
 
03:01:19.110 --> 03:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
different crew that's a different group
 
03:01:21.030 --> 03:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay sorry thank you
 
03:01:22.790 --> 03:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
so you're off the hook you guys can send
 
03:01:24.550 --> 03:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
me a candy bar for that
 
03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:01:31.429 --> 03:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
on page four we're listing our major
 
03:01:36.070 --> 03:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
budget categories that correspond to the
 
03:01:38.070 --> 03:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
numbers on page five to the spreadsheet
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
on page five
 
03:01:41.670 --> 03:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
so item number one are salaries and
 
03:01:45.349 --> 03:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
benefits they're decreasing in fy 22 as
 
03:01:49.110 --> 03:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
a result of position changes and a
 
03:01:52.469 --> 03:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
decrease in the retiree health
 
03:01:55.269 --> 03:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
fy 23 increase
 
03:01:58.790 --> 03:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
are to fund the 27th pay period in other
 
03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:01.110 align:start position:0%
are to fund the 27th pay period in other
increments

03:02:01.110 --> 03:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
increments
 
03:02:03.990 --> 03:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
current expense includes 2.8 million for
 
03:02:06.710 --> 03:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
our advertising contract and other items
 
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
such as office and cleaning supplies
 
03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
paper bags and receipt rolls for our
 
03:02:13.510 --> 03:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
outlet stores
 
03:02:16.070 --> 03:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
rents and leases this is to fund the
 
03:02:19.110 --> 03:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
necessary current rent obligations and
 
03:02:21.269 --> 03:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
expanding square footage for new outlet
 
03:02:21.279 --> 03:02:22.550 align:start position:0%
expanding square footage for new outlet
locations

03:02:22.550 --> 03:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
locations
 
03:02:25.349 --> 03:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
fy21 budget is underfunded because of
 
03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
outlet changes that we've made after the
 
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
budget period so this creates a larger
 
03:02:35.670 --> 03:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
increase in fy 22. fy 23 is level funded
 
03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:36.950 align:start position:0%
increase in fy 22. fy 23 is level funded
utilities

03:02:36.950 --> 03:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
03:02:38.870 --> 03:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
in fy 22
 
03:02:41.510 --> 03:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
are decreasing and are flat funded in fy
 
03:02:44.389 --> 03:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
23 as a result of more energy efficient
 
03:02:44.399 --> 03:02:45.990 align:start position:0%
23 as a result of more energy efficient
outlets

03:02:45.990 --> 03:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
outlets
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
item number five contracts for operation
 
03:02:50.870 --> 03:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
includes our maintenance contracts such
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
as electrical hvac
 
03:02:54.950 --> 03:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
security systems
 
03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
and smart safes and armored car services
 
03:03:01.510 --> 03:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
which we added in november of 2018.
 
03:03:04.150 --> 03:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
fy 22 funding is based on current
 
03:03:06.469 --> 03:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
contracts and our projected needs
 
03:03:09.750 --> 03:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
fy 23 increase is a result of an extra
 
03:03:11.349 --> 03:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars for maintenance and
 
03:03:14.389 --> 03:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
support contract for the d365 software
 
03:03:16.870 --> 03:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
platform this is to support the point of
 
03:03:20.550 --> 03:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
sale and back office financial system
 
03:03:22.950 --> 03:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
doit is the funding needed to maintain
 
03:03:25.429 --> 03:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
our current pos and back office systems
 
03:03:27.590 --> 03:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
and additional funds necessary for
 
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
licensing cloud services and other
 
03:03:32.309 --> 03:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
annual software requirements to support
 
03:03:36.230 --> 03:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
the new d365 software platform
 
03:03:38.070 --> 03:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
equipment includes items such as
 
03:03:40.389 --> 03:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
shelving checkouts on this item number
 
03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
seven is checkouts and security cameras
 
03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
for new and updated outlets and a
 
03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
rotation plan for replacing
 
03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
existing equipment such as vehicles
 
03:03:53.590 --> 03:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
floor cleaners and forklifts
 
03:03:55.750 --> 03:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
number eight in-state travel this is the
 
03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
funding for
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
store moves and staffing changes
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
and number nine
 
03:04:04.870 --> 03:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
other expenses the primary change is
 
03:04:06.630 --> 03:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
from debt services
 
03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
which is based on the current bond
 
03:04:12.389 --> 03:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
schedule and estimates for new debt
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to note that you'll see
 
03:04:16.469 --> 03:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
changes in the indirect cost line
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
because the total for the agency was
 
03:04:20.950 --> 03:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
previously budgeted and paid for out of
 
03:04:23.030 --> 03:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 1023 financial
 
03:04:26.870 --> 03:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
administration and in fy 22 and 23 we've
 
03:04:29.269 --> 03:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
reallocated the amount to the divisions
 
03:04:33.830 --> 03:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:38.070 --> 03:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
we'll go to page six the fy 22 requested
 
03:04:41.429 --> 03:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
budget is 1.1 million or 1.4 percent
 
03:04:43.990 --> 03:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
more than the fy 21 adjusted authorized
 
03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:44.870 align:start position:0%
more than the fy 21 adjusted authorized
budget

03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:04:46.870 --> 03:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
a number of class categories decreased
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
such as salaries and benefits utilities
 
03:04:51.510 --> 03:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
equipment and debt and a number of class
 
03:04:53.670 --> 03:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
categories increased such as rents
 
03:04:55.750 --> 03:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
contracts and doit
 
03:04:58.309 --> 03:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
this is a result of fy21 adjusted
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
authorized budget versus what we
 
03:05:02.070 --> 03:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
actually spent
 
03:05:05.510 --> 03:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
so with fy22 based on what our current
 
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
spend pattern is
 
03:05:09.750 --> 03:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
there are two pie charts
 
03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
show the annual budget
 
03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
first by class with salaries and
 
03:05:17.590 --> 03:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
benefits making up 56
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
and then the other one by accounting
 
03:05:21.590 --> 03:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
unit to show that store operations makes
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:28.389 --> 03:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
on page seven
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
fy 23 budget the requested budget is 3.4
 
03:05:35.670 --> 03:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
million or 4.3 percent increase over
 
03:05:35.680 --> 03:05:37.349 align:start position:0%
million or 4.3 percent increase over
fy22

03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
fy22
 
03:05:39.030 --> 03:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
the two main reasons for the budget
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
increase is the 2.1 million in salaries
 
03:05:44.830 --> 03:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
and benefits for the 27th
 
03:05:47.510 --> 03:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
paycheck and a million dollars in
 
03:05:51.030 --> 03:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
contracts and operations for the d365
 
03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance of support contract
 
03:05:55.910 --> 03:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
but we've also included an appendix for
 
03:05:57.830 --> 03:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
a technical correction requesting to
 
03:06:00.150 --> 03:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
move the funds for the contract from
 
03:06:03.110 --> 03:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
class 103 to class 38 software
 
03:06:05.349 --> 03:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
technology which i will explain when we
 
03:06:09.349 --> 03:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:11.429 --> 03:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
tina can you stop a minute
 
03:06:14.710 --> 03:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
we're seeing agency after agency come in
 
03:06:18.230 --> 03:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
lower percentage than last year
 
03:06:23.429 --> 03:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
so seeing
 
03:06:26.230 --> 03:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
a 4.3 percent increase here
 
03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
and in a previous one you also had an
 
03:06:28.720 --> 03:06:30.469 align:start position:0%
and in a previous one you also had an
increase

03:06:30.469 --> 03:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:06:30.479 --> 03:06:32.710 align:start position:0%
increase
i

03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:35.349 --> 03:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned
 
03:06:38.950 --> 03:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
that other agencies are making some cuts
 
03:06:41.510 --> 03:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate you guys raise money
 
03:06:42.870 --> 03:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
but we need
 
03:06:45.190 --> 03:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
i currently need to cut
 
03:06:46.790 --> 03:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of money i mean you must
 
03:06:48.469 --> 03:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
know what the ways and means revenue
 
03:06:49.750 --> 03:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
estimates were
 
03:06:51.910 --> 03:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm concerned about all of these
 
03:06:51.920 --> 03:06:54.389 align:start position:0%
so i'm concerned about all of these
increases

03:06:54.389 --> 03:06:54.399 align:start position:0%
increases
 
03:06:57.110 --> 03:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
well the increase for fy 23 you'll see
 
03:06:59.030 --> 03:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
the 2 million of that is for the
 
03:07:01.590 --> 03:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits for the 27th pay
 
03:07:04.150 --> 03:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
period and we have no control over that
 
03:07:06.389 --> 03:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
and well i did get that out and i don't
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
think yours was that much lba did give
 
03:07:11.750 --> 03:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
me a share on that i will double check
 
03:07:13.510 --> 03:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
that when i go home but i don't think
 
03:07:15.750 --> 03:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
yours was that high on what they
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
expected it to be
 
03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
our our average checks right now for a
 
03:07:27.349 --> 03:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:29.110 --> 03:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
and we are looking at increasing our
 
03:07:31.750 --> 03:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates for 22 and 23 by the
 
03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
1.6 and the 2 million
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
i would just say madam chair is you know
 
03:07:40.309 --> 03:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
to have this type of revenue increase
 
03:07:43.030 --> 03:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
where our revenue uh versus prior year
 
03:07:44.550 --> 03:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
our net profit
 
03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
is up 14.7
 
03:07:46.720 --> 03:07:47.469 align:start position:0%
is up 14.7
or

03:07:47.469 --> 03:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:07:51.190 --> 03:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
13.9 million and our actual uh
 
03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
revenue to the general fund is up 5.2
 
03:07:57.990 --> 03:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
percent or 4.4 million at this point i
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
think it would be uh i think it would be
 
03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
a miscalculation of our funds to be able
 
03:08:06.950 --> 03:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
to cut anything now and continue to
 
03:08:09.269 --> 03:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
drive those profits when we're when
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're finally after many years coming
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:21.190 --> 03:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
i think the numbers speak for themselves
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
if you were in the room you would hear
 
03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
the sighs i'm hearing joe
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
i hear what you're saying but i am
 
03:08:26.399 --> 03:08:27.670 align:start position:0%
i hear what you're saying but i am
concerned

03:08:27.670 --> 03:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
03:08:30.070 --> 03:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
please continue
 
03:08:33.990 --> 03:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:36.630 --> 03:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
so on page seven the pie charts show the
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
same breakdown by class and accounting
 
03:08:38.399 --> 03:08:39.510 align:start position:0%
same breakdown by class and accounting
unit

03:08:39.510 --> 03:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
unit
 
03:08:41.190 --> 03:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
on page eight
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
the commission is the organizational
 
03:08:44.790 --> 03:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
structure and the commission is made up
 
03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
of three divisions that report to the
 
03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and the deputy commissioner
 
03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
blow are the divisions with the areas of
 
03:08:53.269 --> 03:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities listed and the number
 
03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
of unclassified and classified positions
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
how many positions are unfunded in each
 
03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
of these divisions
 
03:09:05.990 --> 03:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
we have no unfunded positions how many
 
03:09:08.710 --> 03:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
positions are vacant in each of these
 
03:09:08.720 --> 03:09:10.150 align:start position:0%
positions are vacant in each of these
divisions

03:09:10.150 --> 03:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
divisions
 
03:09:13.030 --> 03:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
at this point we have about 24 vacant
 
03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:14.630 align:start position:0%
at this point we have about 24 vacant
positions

03:09:14.630 --> 03:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:09:17.110 --> 03:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
in which division
 
03:09:23.670 --> 03:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:26.389 --> 03:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
would you like the breakdown
 
03:09:28.550 --> 03:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
what would you like me to no
 
03:09:33.429 --> 03:09:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:34.950 --> 03:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
on page nine
 
03:09:37.030 --> 03:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
provides a breakdown of the office of
 
03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
the commission and followed by each
 
03:09:38.720 --> 03:09:39.830 align:start position:0%
the commission and followed by each
division

03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
the primary budget changes are the same
 
03:09:44.469 --> 03:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
throughout fy 22
 
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
result of reallocating of indirect costs
 
03:09:51.349 --> 03:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
and fy 23 is for the 27th pay period so
 
03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
at this point i won't take the time to
 
03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
go through each individually unless you
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:02.229 --> 03:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
what does the division
 
03:10:05.590 --> 03:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
guys what would you like her to do
 
03:10:08.309 --> 03:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
okay please continue
 
03:10:10.229 --> 03:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
okay so you'll see for the office of the
 
03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
commission the fy 22 budget increase is
 
03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:14.950 align:start position:0%
commission the fy 22 budget increase is
62

03:10:14.950 --> 03:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
62
 
03:10:18.950 --> 03:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
or 545 000 but the indirect cost that
 
03:10:22.469 --> 03:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
was reallocated to this division was 527
 
03:10:24.229 --> 03:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
000 so there really isn't much of an
 
03:10:27.670 --> 03:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
increase in 22 and the fy 23 budget is
 
03:10:29.110 --> 03:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
increasing 2
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
or 31 000 for that extra paycheck
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
and all of that
 
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
tina some of those uh reallocations came
 
03:10:39.110 --> 03:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
out of your division right
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
your office
 
03:10:43.510 --> 03:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
came out we will see we will see a
 
03:10:43.520 --> 03:10:45.349 align:start position:0%
came out we will see we will see a
corresponding

03:10:45.349 --> 03:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
corresponding
 
03:10:45.359 --> 03:10:46.950 align:start position:0%
corresponding
lowering

03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
lowering
 
03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
in your area
 
03:10:51.830 --> 03:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
correct about 1.8 million in in finance
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
administration okay thank you you're
 
03:10:54.479 --> 03:10:56.950 align:start position:0%
administration okay thank you you're
welcome

03:10:56.950 --> 03:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:56.960 --> 03:10:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:10:57.910 --> 03:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:59.990 --> 03:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
so each page we provided a pie chart
 
03:11:01.830 --> 03:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
that shows um the office of the
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
commission salaries and benefits
 
03:11:08.950 --> 03:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:08.960 --> 03:11:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:11:09.750 --> 03:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:11:11.590 --> 03:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
authorized full-time positions in this
 
03:11:14.309 --> 03:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
division is two unclassified and two
 
03:11:16.389 --> 03:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
classified positions
 
03:11:18.309 --> 03:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
on page 10 we have the division of
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement and i also highlighted on
 
03:11:24.710 --> 03:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
each page the corresponding um pages in
 
03:11:26.870 --> 03:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
the house bill 1
 
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
so you know where each division starts
 
03:11:30.790 --> 03:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that's very helpful thank you
 
03:11:32.389 --> 03:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
03:11:36.309 --> 03:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh fy 22 budget is increasing 1 or 36
 
03:11:38.630 --> 03:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
000 for enforcement
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
but they also have the added 32 000 for
 
03:11:43.269 --> 03:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
indirect costs so enforcement is pretty
 
03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
much flat funded in fy 22 and fy 23
 
03:11:50.229 --> 03:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
budget is a 5 increase or 232 000 and
 
03:11:52.229 --> 03:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's to fund the additional pay
 
03:11:52.239 --> 03:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
that's to fund the additional pay
paycheck

03:11:53.510 --> 03:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
paycheck
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
can you talk about the position changes
 
03:11:59.190 --> 03:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
under salary you have a 82 000 decrease
 
03:12:01.830 --> 03:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
what positions changed
 
03:12:01.840 --> 03:12:02.870 align:start position:0%
what positions changed
um

03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:05.750 --> 03:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
we had some people that retired and you
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
have new people coming on at a lower um
 
03:12:08.399 --> 03:12:09.269 align:start position:0%
have new people coming on at a lower um
step

03:12:09.269 --> 03:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
step
 
03:12:11.429 --> 03:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
and we also had some positions that we
 
03:12:11.439 --> 03:12:12.630 align:start position:0%
and we also had some positions that we
dragged

03:12:12.630 --> 03:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
dragged
 
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
for a period of time
 
03:12:18.469 --> 03:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:12:21.110 --> 03:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
in the division of enforcement the
 
03:12:23.110 --> 03:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
authorized full-time positions one
 
03:12:26.870 --> 03:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
unclassified 12 sworn in 12 civilian
 
03:12:28.950 --> 03:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
i mean 21 sworn i'm sorry and 12

civilian
 
03:12:32.790 --> 03:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
the division of enforcement provides
 
03:12:32.800 --> 03:12:33.990 align:start position:0%
the division of enforcement provides
over

03:12:33.990 --> 03:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
over
 
03:12:37.590 --> 03:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
services for over 5 700 licensees
 
03:12:39.590 --> 03:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
and they collect over 18 million in
 
03:12:44.550 --> 03:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:46.389 --> 03:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
on the next slide you have the division
 
03:12:50.710 --> 03:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
fy 22 budget decrease 11 or a million
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
dollars there's the 1.8 million for the
 
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
deduction in indirect costs an fy 22
 
03:13:03.429 --> 03:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
budget increase is 1.4
 
03:13:06.870 --> 03:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
or 114 000 which is for the 27th pay
 
03:13:06.880 --> 03:13:08.229 align:start position:0%
or 114 000 which is for the 27th pay
period

03:13:08.229 --> 03:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:13:10.950 --> 03:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
as you can see uh the doit budget makes
 
03:13:14.630 --> 03:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
up about 60 of this division funding
 
03:13:16.550 --> 03:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
the authorized full-time positions is
 
03:13:18.469 --> 03:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
one classified
 
03:13:22.150 --> 03:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
15 in finance seven in hr four in our
 
03:13:24.870 --> 03:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
outlet auditors two inventory control
 
03:13:28.150 --> 03:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
and three in legal
 
03:13:30.309 --> 03:13:30.319 align:start position:0%
on page 12 we have the division of

marketing and merchandising
 
03:13:36.630 --> 03:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
fy 22 budget increase is 2.5 or 1.6
 
03:13:36.640 --> 03:13:37.590 align:start position:0%
fy 22 budget increase is 2.5 or 1.6
million

03:13:37.590 --> 03:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:13:39.750 --> 03:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is because this division absorbed
 
03:13:43.269 --> 03:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
most of the indirect cost of 1.3 million
 
03:13:47.429 --> 03:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
fy 23 budget increase of 4.8 percent or
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
3 million dollars is for the 27th
 
03:13:53.030 --> 03:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
paycheck and for the additional funding
 
03:13:56.309 --> 03:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
for the maintenance and support contract
 
03:13:58.309 --> 03:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
the authorized full-time positions is
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
one unclassified 13 in marketing and
 
03:14:04.469 --> 03:14:04.479 align:start position:0%

03:14:13.269 --> 03:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
on page 13 i provided the workers comp
 
03:14:16.150 --> 03:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
in unemployment comp budgets accounting
 
03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
in unemployment comp budgets accounting
units

03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
units
 
03:14:20.229 --> 03:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
and then on page 14 we have the appendix
 
03:14:22.229 --> 03:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
technical correction where we're
 
03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
requesting to move the funding from
 
03:14:27.590 --> 03:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:31.349 --> 03:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
1030 store operations the class 103 to
 
03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
class 38
 
03:14:37.670 --> 03:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
on page 15 we provided you a snapshot of
 
03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
the contract cover page where it was
 
03:14:41.830 --> 03:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
approved through gnc
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:49.590 --> 03:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
so that concludes the presentation we've
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
also provided responses to madam chairs
 
03:14:53.830 --> 03:14:53.840 align:start position:0%

could you tell me why your overtime line
 
03:15:17.269 --> 03:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
03:15:19.590 --> 03:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 18 at the bottom of the
 
03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:20.870 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 18 at the bottom of the
page

03:15:20.870 --> 03:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
in 2020 there was 17 000 and you're
 
03:15:27.030 --> 03:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
forecasting 70 000 for this coming
 
03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what page you're on uh 343
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:43.110 --> 03:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's for the um synar grant
 
03:15:49.590 --> 03:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
and in the budget for
 
03:15:52.229 --> 03:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 we had
 
03:15:54.870 --> 03:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
less funding we only had
 
03:15:57.349 --> 03:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
what was it one grant for sinar and
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
they've increased it by another
 
03:16:00.630 --> 03:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
50 000
 
03:16:05.429 --> 03:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:07.830 --> 03:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
so the the grant itself the funding for
 
03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
the grant has increased
 
03:16:12.150 --> 03:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
which was allocated throughout the the
 
03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
um grant so you can see it went from
 
03:16:18.870 --> 03:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
on page 344 for the total for fy22 it
 
03:16:27.750 --> 03:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:30.950 --> 03:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay how does that get increased why
 
03:16:33.910 --> 03:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
how does that get increased
 
03:16:35.830 --> 03:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so how does that get increased the
 
03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:37.110 align:start position:0%
yeah so how does that get increased the
grant

03:16:37.110 --> 03:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
grant
 
03:16:41.190 --> 03:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
we received additional funds from hhs so
 
03:16:44.229 --> 03:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
there was a new uh grant award it went
 
03:16:47.349 --> 03:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:49.670 --> 03:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
it started out at at 50 there was an
 
03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
increase to 55 000 and then we just
 
03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:03.349 --> 03:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:05.830 --> 03:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i look at the
 
03:17:05.840 --> 03:17:07.830 align:start position:0%
and i look at the
total

03:17:07.830 --> 03:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
total
 
03:17:07.840 --> 03:17:09.190 align:start position:0%
total
for

03:17:09.190 --> 03:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:17:12.309 --> 03:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement the fda tobacco i continue
 
03:17:13.910 --> 03:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
that all the way down to again to the
 
03:17:13.920 --> 03:17:14.790 align:start position:0%
that all the way down to again to the
total

03:17:14.790 --> 03:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
total
 
03:17:17.030 --> 03:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
are you saying that grant is responsible
 
03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:25.670 --> 03:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
because if you look at the actual of 142
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
and what you're planning for in
 
03:17:28.319 --> 03:17:30.229 align:start position:0%
and what you're planning for in
2022

03:17:30.229 --> 03:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
2022
 
03:17:32.870 --> 03:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's like 64 percent of my rough head
 
03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:35.269 align:start position:0%
it's like 64 percent of my rough head
numbers

03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
03:17:37.190 --> 03:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
so that's because of the grant you're
 
03:17:37.200 --> 03:17:40.070 align:start position:0%
so that's because of the grant you're
saying

03:17:40.070 --> 03:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:17:40.080 --> 03:17:43.190 align:start position:0%
saying
yes

03:17:43.190 --> 03:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:43.200 --> 03:17:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
interesting

03:17:45.349 --> 03:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
i have i have nothing further at the
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:54.710 --> 03:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
phantom chair uh neither purpose or
 
03:17:56.880 --> 03:17:58.070 align:start position:0%
phantom chair uh neither purpose or
balls

03:17:58.070 --> 03:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
balls
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
neither bill nor i have these documents
 
03:18:02.550 --> 03:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
lba doesn't have them um they said
 
03:18:04.150 --> 03:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get them from janet
 
03:18:05.590 --> 03:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
nothing has turned up through this
 
03:18:07.510 --> 03:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
entire presentation neither of us have
 
03:18:08.950 --> 03:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
been able to follow this because we
 
03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the documents and i just
 
03:18:12.389 --> 03:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to point that out that we don't
 
03:18:14.309 --> 03:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
really know what's going on
 
03:18:15.349 --> 03:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
we are
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
i mean as as i said this morning one of
 
03:18:19.269 --> 03:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
the things we've learned in this
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
division was why remote meetings are not
 
03:18:25.349 --> 03:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
working well and here we are so thank
 
03:18:27.510 --> 03:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
you for that well i think it might have
 
03:18:29.269 --> 03:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
to do with when the liquor commission if
 
03:18:31.030 --> 03:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission sent the documents
 
03:18:33.590 --> 03:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
because nobody else seems to have them
 
03:18:36.070 --> 03:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
except you guys and well we didn't get
 
03:18:38.389 --> 03:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
them until later this afternoon when
 
03:18:40.389 --> 03:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
they were brought in so we didn't have
 
03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
them early either as you recall sitting
 
03:18:45.590 --> 03:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
on the division last year most of these
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
documents are handed to you as they walk
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
through the door
 
03:18:51.110 --> 03:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
which we appreciate so i i hear what
 
03:18:52.309 --> 03:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
03:18:54.070 --> 03:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing i can do about it
 
03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
sitting right now
 
03:18:58.389 --> 03:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
nina can you tell me what
 
03:19:01.190 --> 03:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
sinar actually is i guess i don't
 
03:19:01.200 --> 03:19:02.630 align:start position:0%
sinar actually is i guess i don't
understand

03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:19:05.830 --> 03:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
why you get a grant from hhs
 
03:19:08.229 --> 03:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
i will defer that to the chief that
 
03:19:12.630 --> 03:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:15.670 --> 03:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
i think of you as selling product making
 
03:19:17.590 --> 03:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
money spending
 
03:19:19.910 --> 03:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
money to sell the product but making
 
03:19:22.870 --> 03:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
money and giving it to us and us not
 
03:19:25.190 --> 03:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
giving it back to you so this was a
 
03:19:27.110 --> 03:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
little confusing
 
03:19:29.429 --> 03:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
for me
 
03:19:32.229 --> 03:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
and maybe mark can step up to the mic or
 
03:19:34.389 --> 03:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
he has a mic back there he can explain
 
03:19:36.150 --> 03:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
this to me
 
03:19:39.030 --> 03:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:40.950 --> 03:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
can you guys hear
 
03:19:40.960 --> 03:19:41.590 align:start position:0%
can you guys hear
me

03:19:41.590 --> 03:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
not really
 
03:19:44.710 --> 03:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay i'll come up
 
03:19:47.110 --> 03:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
remember we have this air filtration
 
03:19:47.120 --> 03:19:48.229 align:start position:0%
remember we have this air filtration
system

03:19:48.229 --> 03:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have wonderful air
 
03:19:53.269 --> 03:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:56.309 --> 03:19:56.319 align:start position:0%

thousand dollars was actually awarded to
 
03:20:15.830 --> 03:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
us through hhs to do alcohol compliance

that money was utilized or is being
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
utilized uh in partnership with the
 
03:20:34.710 --> 03:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities throughout the state
 
03:20:37.110 --> 03:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
to do alcohol compliance
 
03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
um at any one of our
 
03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:40.790 align:start position:0%
um at any one of our
uh

03:20:40.790 --> 03:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
i think we're at 3 000 3400
 
03:20:48.630 --> 03:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:50.950 --> 03:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
so let me see if i have this
 
03:20:53.190 --> 03:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
you sell product you make money
 
03:20:54.870 --> 03:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
five percent of that money goes to the
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
governor's commission on alcohol abuse
 
03:20:59.030 --> 03:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
and you got a hundred thousand dollars
 
03:21:09.349 --> 03:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
so the money that was actually given to
 
03:21:15.190 --> 03:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
us was actually not requested it was
 
03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:16.309 align:start position:0%
us was actually not requested it was
actually

03:21:16.309 --> 03:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:21:19.990 --> 03:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
requested of us to run this program
 
03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:20.790 align:start position:0%
requested of us to run this program
so

03:21:20.790 --> 03:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
um i i don't understand the five percent
 
03:21:25.359 --> 03:21:26.710 align:start position:0%
um i i don't understand the five percent
turnaround

03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
turnaround
 
03:21:26.720 --> 03:21:27.590 align:start position:0%
turnaround
but

03:21:27.590 --> 03:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:21:27.600 --> 03:21:28.950 align:start position:0%
but
um

03:21:28.950 --> 03:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:31.429 --> 03:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
this was something that back in the day
 
03:21:35.190 --> 03:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
was it was called util the util grant
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh for underage compliance
 
03:21:41.590 --> 03:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
and it has just come forward in a
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
mark can you tell us how enforcement is
 
03:21:59.910 --> 03:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
really organized do all of those people
 
03:22:01.910 --> 03:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
report to you
 
03:22:04.950 --> 03:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes we we have a rank structure for
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:11.830 --> 03:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
is a rank structure that has been
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
minimized and leaned down
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh over the years but our
 
03:22:17.600 --> 03:22:18.469 align:start position:0%
uh over the years but our
uh

03:22:18.469 --> 03:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:22:18.479 --> 03:22:19.750 align:start position:0%
uh
our

03:22:19.750 --> 03:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement personnel our
 
03:22:24.070 --> 03:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
investigators actually report to a
 
03:22:27.030 --> 03:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
supervisor a a boot on the ground
 
03:22:27.040 --> 03:22:28.550 align:start position:0%
supervisor a a boot on the ground
supervisor

03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
supervisor
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
so you have one supervisor
 
03:22:33.510 --> 03:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
we have three supervisors for three
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
different teams
 
03:22:35.120 --> 03:22:37.349 align:start position:0%
different teams
of

03:22:37.349 --> 03:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:45.269 --> 03:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
okay are those supervisors part of the
 
03:22:47.429 --> 03:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
21 sworn staff
 
03:22:47.439 --> 03:22:50.710 align:start position:0%
21 sworn staff
yes

03:22:50.710 --> 03:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
and how many do each of the three
 
03:22:56.309 --> 03:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
supervisors have reporting to them
 
03:22:56.319 --> 03:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
supervisors have reporting to them
um

03:22:57.110 --> 03:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:06.469 --> 03:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
temporary assignments
 
03:23:08.469 --> 03:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
where we need of course everything is
 
03:23:11.670 --> 03:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
done driven here so if we see that data
 
03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
is showing us that we need help in a
 
03:23:17.349 --> 03:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
certain area we will actually
 
03:23:19.510 --> 03:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
move that supervisor i'm sorry that
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
investigator to the particular area to
 
03:23:23.510 --> 03:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
help out
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
so according to the information on page
 
03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
8 you have 34
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
people in your enforcement
 
03:23:33.990 --> 03:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
division and you of course are the one
 
03:23:37.190 --> 03:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
unclassified under you you have three
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
33 classified of those three are
 
03:23:40.800 --> 03:23:42.710 align:start position:0%
33 classified of those three are
supervisors

03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
supervisors
 
03:23:45.190 --> 03:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
having six to seven people reporting to
 
03:23:47.830 --> 03:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
them so between 18 and 21 people
 
03:23:50.070 --> 03:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
reporting to them
 
03:23:53.349 --> 03:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
do the rest of the people report to you
 
03:23:55.349 --> 03:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh no so
 
03:23:57.110 --> 03:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
then um
 
03:23:59.910 --> 03:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
on our administrative side of the house
 
03:24:01.110 --> 03:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:24:04.070 --> 03:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh for the majority civilian staffing
 
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
a civilian a civilian supervisor that
 
03:24:14.229 --> 03:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
oversees the auditing area we have a
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
sworn supervisor that actually looks
 
03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
over the
 
03:24:19.910 --> 03:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
licensing area
 
03:24:23.110 --> 03:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
and that is all overseen by a
 
03:24:23.120 --> 03:24:24.550 align:start position:0%
and that is all overseen by a
lieutenant

03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
lieutenant
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
so you have
 
03:24:28.150 --> 03:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
a total of five supervisors
 
03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
in your area
 
03:24:34.070 --> 03:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:36.870 --> 03:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
so the breakdown madam chair would be
 
03:24:39.030 --> 03:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh three sergeants
 
03:24:43.510 --> 03:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:46.150 --> 03:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
and then of course myself and the deputy
 
03:24:46.160 --> 03:24:47.269 align:start position:0%
and then of course myself and the deputy
chief

03:24:47.269 --> 03:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
chief
 
03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:24:50.309 --> 03:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
the rest our civilian
 
03:24:50.319 --> 03:24:55.110 align:start position:0%
the rest our civilian
staff

03:24:55.110 --> 03:24:55.120 align:start position:0%

with the grant that you received from
 
03:25:16.070 --> 03:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
majesty i had asked earlier if you've
 
03:25:18.309 --> 03:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
got any data just to prove that it's
 
03:25:19.750 --> 03:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
been a positive
 
03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
impact or effect and they got them off
 
03:25:24.710 --> 03:25:24.720 align:start position:0%

underage buyers
 
03:26:00.229 --> 03:26:00.239 align:start position:0%

to be be done in terms of compliance
 
03:27:49.349 --> 03:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
there was a i'm just asking that because
 
03:27:50.790 --> 03:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
there was a huge problem with that in
 
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
the past before your tenure of course
 
03:27:54.870 --> 03:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless there it's been a huge
 
03:27:56.469 --> 03:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
problem and
 
03:27:58.469 --> 03:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and and
 
03:28:01.190 --> 03:28:01.200 align:start position:0%

any other questions representative
 
03:30:34.800 --> 03:30:35.830 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
leishman

03:30:35.830 --> 03:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
leishman
 
03:30:38.229 --> 03:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:30:40.070 --> 03:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
so we heard from the
 
03:30:41.510 --> 03:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner the department of
 
03:30:43.990 --> 03:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
administrative services that has shown
 
03:30:46.950 --> 03:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
us and seen documentation a lot of our
 
03:30:49.110 --> 03:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
health care and benefits costs have been
 
03:30:51.429 --> 03:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
reduced substantially
 
03:30:53.670 --> 03:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
yet i'm looking at yours and i'm just
 
03:30:57.510 --> 03:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
going i'll take a page here 349
 
03:30:57.520 --> 03:30:58.469 align:start position:0%
going i'll take a page here 349
and

03:30:58.469 --> 03:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:01.830 --> 03:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
compared to 2020 and going over to
 
03:31:05.349 --> 03:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
2022 your benefits are up nearly 20
 
03:31:05.359 --> 03:31:06.630 align:start position:0%
2022 your benefits are up nearly 20
percent

03:31:06.630 --> 03:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
so why are your costs for benefits
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
going up so much when other departments
 
03:31:14.550 --> 03:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
and commissions and so forth in the
 
03:31:14.560 --> 03:31:15.429 align:start position:0%
and commissions and so forth in the
state

03:31:15.429 --> 03:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:31:18.630 --> 03:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
going down or staying flat
 
03:31:20.630 --> 03:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
well the actual
 
03:31:24.309 --> 03:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
budget for benefits is based on the
 
03:31:26.550 --> 03:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
full-time positions or the benefits
 
03:31:26.560 --> 03:31:28.229 align:start position:0%
full-time positions or the benefits
associated

03:31:28.229 --> 03:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
associated
 
03:31:31.590 --> 03:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
with um part-timers so that's that's
 
03:31:33.990 --> 03:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
driven by the system it's not calculated
 
03:31:35.910 --> 03:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
by us
 
03:31:38.229 --> 03:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
so it could be that we've had a position
 
03:31:41.349 --> 03:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
that changed from somebody that came in
 
03:31:43.750 --> 03:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
with a family that before was on a
 
03:31:50.790 --> 03:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:50.800 --> 03:31:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:31:53.590 --> 03:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
tina have you been having quite a bit of
 
03:31:53.600 --> 03:31:55.670 align:start position:0%
tina have you been having quite a bit of
turnover

03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
turnover
 
03:31:57.670 --> 03:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:32:00.070 --> 03:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
in finance or agency well anywhere
 
03:32:02.710 --> 03:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
because you're right as people change i
 
03:32:04.870 --> 03:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
mean it's not as
 
03:32:06.229 --> 03:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
you may have had some people who had a
 
03:32:08.950 --> 03:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
baby who used to be a two person and so
 
03:32:10.870 --> 03:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
now their family but i just wondered if
 
03:32:12.950 --> 03:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
you were having from
 
03:32:15.349 --> 03:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
retirements because we are have had a
 
03:32:17.110 --> 03:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
lot of retirements
 
03:32:19.590 --> 03:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
i mean some of that leads to turnover
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
yes we have had turnover
 
03:32:24.950 --> 03:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
and that leads to benefit changes based
 
03:32:24.960 --> 03:32:25.830 align:start position:0%
and that leads to benefit changes based
on

03:32:25.830 --> 03:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:32:27.030 --> 03:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
who you hire
 
03:32:27.040 --> 03:32:36.630 align:start position:0%
who you hire
correct

03:32:36.630 --> 03:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
going once going twice unsure if it may
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
yes i didn't know if your hand was up
 
03:32:45.429 --> 03:32:45.439 align:start position:0%

03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
program was dropped off at nine o'clock
 
03:34:27.910 --> 03:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
this morning over at the state house so
 
03:34:30.469 --> 03:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
i sincerely apologize for
 
03:34:32.870 --> 03:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh they're not getting to uh the
 
03:34:35.110 --> 03:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
representatives as commissioner we have
 
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
a couple of people who who are i mean
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
five of us are here in the state house
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
by nine o'clock this morning i was
 
03:34:43.269 --> 03:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
meeting with the governor on something
 
03:34:45.349 --> 03:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
else so you know it's just been one of
 
03:34:47.110 --> 03:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
those days where we've all been running
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
here and there and we understand
 
03:34:49.439 --> 03:34:50.309 align:start position:0%
here and there and we understand
now

03:34:50.309 --> 03:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:34:52.150 --> 03:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
there are really significant
 
03:34:55.590 --> 03:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
difficulties with remote situations and
 
03:34:58.150 --> 03:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
i think we have encountered almost all
 
03:35:00.309 --> 03:35:00.319 align:start position:0%
of them including a sound board that was
 
03:35:03.110 --> 03:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
losing a channel so we had constant
 
03:35:05.110 --> 03:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
static and we tried
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things here we were the
 
03:35:08.469 --> 03:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
most creative people at trying to get
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
rid of static so that represent walls of
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative hatch no longer had it in
 
03:35:15.910 --> 03:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
their ear that you could imagine but
 
03:35:17.910 --> 03:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
replacing the board finally is what did
 
03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
it so you know it's been
 
03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
up and down and we appreciate it we're
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
working the best we can through this
 
03:35:26.550 --> 03:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
right now most of us here in this room
 
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
have been
 
03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
happily vaccinated and
 
03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
tracy took the hard way he had coveted
 
03:35:34.630 --> 03:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
and recovered so he joined the herd the
 
03:35:37.349 --> 03:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
hard way i took the vaccinated route
 
03:35:39.750 --> 03:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we've just tried a variety of
 
03:35:41.830 --> 03:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
things here and we're working together
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a perfect world even when you
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%

03:35:46.710 --> 03:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
