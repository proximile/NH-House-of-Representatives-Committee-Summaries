full-time active
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
firefighters Mr chairman um I have
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
handed your uh your Clerk and article
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
that was uh fairly recent in the union
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
leader talking about a firefighter uh
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
from the city of Manchester who did have
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
early detection um and was discovered to
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
have had uh cancer of the colon and so
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to make sure that article
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
was available for uh the committee
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
members to
 
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
read I think it's important that we
 
00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
realize that prevention is extremely
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
important and that their our
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
firefighters have been facing a number
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
of significant Health RIS risks because
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
of the material that they use in putting
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
out fires but it's not only that it's in
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
the clothing that they wear we all know
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
about pasas but I don't think most of
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
you know that their clothing their fire
 
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
preven so they don't get burned contains
 
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
P so they have no choice they must wear
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
these uh these articles of clothing to
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
protect themselves so um I think it's
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
time that we step up and we do what we
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
need to do to protect them as
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
well um there are basically I I'd like
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
to just discuss eight key points when
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about occupational
 
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
hazardous awareness um firefighters are
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
exposed to carcinogens during their
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
operations they uh need increased
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
awareness of early detention specific
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
dangers uh are associated with pasas the
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
first one is the occupation
 
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
Hazard awareness firefighters again are
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
exposed to numerous carcinogens during
 
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
firefighter operations which increase
 
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
their risk of developing cancer
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
substantially a cancer screening program
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
would raise awareness even more about
 
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
occupational ha hazards and emphasize
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
the importance of early
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
detection secondly I think we all know
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
early detection saves lives cancer is
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
often more treatable when detected in
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
its early stages implementing regular
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
screenings can help identify potential
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
cases of cancer among firefighters
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
enabling prompt medical intervention and
 
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.269 align:start position:0%
enabling prompt medical intervention and
saving

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
saving
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
lives three job related health support
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
firefighters put their health and their
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
life on the line to protect others a
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
cancer screening program demonstrates a
 
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
commitment to the well-being of these
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
Brave individuals providing them with
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
the necessary tools and resources to
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
Monitor and address potential health
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
risks associated with their profession
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
four it actually reduces health care
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
costs early detect early detection and
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
intervention can contribute to lower
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
health care costs in the long run by
 
00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
identifying and treating cancers at an
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
earlier stage the financial burden on
 
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
both firefighters and our Health Care
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
Systems can be reduced compared to the
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
costs associated with Advanced stage
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
cancer treatment can also improve the
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
quality of Life timely cancer screenings
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
can lead to less invasive treatment
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
options and better overall outcomes by
 
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
prioritizing the health of firefighters
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
we not only extend their life expectancy
 
00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839 align:start position:0%
but enhance their quality of life during
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
and after
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
treatment number six is long-term
 
00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:51.399 align:start position:0%
datadriven decisionmaking the cancer
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
screening program would generate
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
valuable data on the prevalence of
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
cancer among firefighters information
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
will be used to red Define uh safety
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%

safety standards implementing a
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
screening program sends a powerful
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
message about the commitment to
 
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
occupational services within the fire
 
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
service it encourages The Establishment
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
and enforcement of stricter safety
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
standards ensuring a healthy your work
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
environment for current and future
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
of firefighters through a cancer
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
screening program can contribute to
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
higher job satisfaction and retention
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
rates I think that I I hope that we can
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
all agree that these eight points I
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
think are are critical we know these
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
folks are being exposed to cancerous
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
chemicals and I think we should step up
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
and we should support them and uh
 
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can um pass this bill and
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
we can provide those services for these
 
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
folks thank you very much Mr chairman
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator questions for Senator

Mr chairman and thank you Senator Carson
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
for bringing this important bill um I
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
have some experience in the diagnostic
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
space I actually as an analyst covered
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
the company that brought that um the
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
colag guard the test for colar rectal
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
cancer and I was working with a lot of
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
companies that were trying to work on
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
this Blood broad blood BL based
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
screening uh my concern is that the
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
multi-cancer blood test um that's
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
detecting signals from as many cancer
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
types as possible um is both too broad
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
of a description and it's something that
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
currently is not approved by the FDA and
 
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
there's questionable validity to it
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
especially because as it's moving
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
towards the the approval process with
 
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
Gallery which is the one that was
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the Senate hearing um that
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
one even in in their data published at
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
the European Society of medical oncology
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
they used two different tests so they
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
couldn't actually compare the different
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
tests um because as they're learning
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
more the screening test changes so we
 
00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't really use it serially for
 
00:15:18.199 --> 00:15:18.910 align:start position:0%
couldn't really use it serially for
these

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
firefighters um so that's pretty much
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
experimental so I'm very concerned about
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
um doing that and giving false hope to
 
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
our firefighters and the ultrasound
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
diagnostic screening of oncology um of
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
cancer when there's not already a signal
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
I wasn't able to find any data on that
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
my question would be that we know that
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
lung CTS and skin cancer screening are
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
important and they save lives my
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
question would be if um you would be
 
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
amenable to removing the more
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
experimental sections from this and
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
focusing at this point on the lung CTS
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
and skin cancer screenings and then
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
possibly working to see if companies um
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
like the one that makes Gallery might
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
include New Hampshire firefighters and a
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
clinical trial for these because this is
 
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
a population that should be addressed
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
and it would have a benefit to the
 
00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
company for looking at this and as a
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
experimental diagnostic um we should
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are appropriately
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
setting the the goals and and
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
expectations for our firefighters while
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
contributing to science so that maybe we
 
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
can detect these early and get
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
actionable effort well thank you very
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
much for your questions what is
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
important to me is the actual screening
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
that takes place I think we need to do
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about very specific
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
types of testing and they're the they're
 
00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
here they're going to be able to answer
 
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
that better than I can about um that
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
particular type of test what's important
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
to me is that it gets done that's what
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
I'm here advocating for they need to
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
have a a cancer screening
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
program thank you you're welcome
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative Paz off and then
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative McLean thank you Mr chair
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
could you explain what currently stops
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh five fighters from screening is it
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
the price is it that they don't know
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
about it and um also uh do you have any
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
idea how how invasive and how long this
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
screening is and uh your bill has a cup
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
for not exceed $1300 so I wonder if we
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
have any idea
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
what the uh expected price for
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive screening is
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
now thank you I'm going to try um I had
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
a little difficulty trying to understand
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
what you're saying are you asking
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
me about first of all the price of the
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
screening and then the first question I
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
think you're trying to what what stops
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
them from screening now what's the bar
 
00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
barrier uh to to screening thank you
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
many um it's my understanding that um
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
many people don't normally get that type
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
of screening um what you're going to do
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
is you're going to get them when they
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
come into the fire service and really
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's a baseline um I would hope that
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
they would continue to get this type of
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
screening um this type of my
 
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
understanding it's not uh it's not cheap
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's more than
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
$100 um but those are all details that
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
um will get worked out as we go through
 
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
this process again my point is this is
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
something that we really need to
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
do representative mlan and then
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King uh thank you Mr
 
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
question so um I work with uh a lot of
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
folks in uh the volunteer firefighting
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
community and the call firefighting
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
community and so they actually were made
 
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
aware of this bill and and they came to
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
me and they asked me to ask this
 
00:18:58.149 --> 00:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
question and and the question is just
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
basically looks like this bill is just
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
for for full-time firefighters and so is
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
that just because that's a pilot program
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
is the intention at some time to pull
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
those folks in or is is the long-term
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
intention of this just to be for
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighters so their question
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
is just they're just trying to
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
understand the the scope and what role
 
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
it might play for them in the future
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you this is this is a
 
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
beginning point this is a starting point
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is establishing this program as
 
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
with any prog program it can expand over
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
time so the the really the point is
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
let's get started let's we're going to
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
start with these folks and they can if
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
they feel that they need to be included
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
someone can file a bill and include
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
them you're welcome representative Seth
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
for taking
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
questions this is a healthc care bill
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a benefit of healthcare
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm curious
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
um firefighters are generally employees
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
of municipalities right and are there
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
any municipalities right now that offer
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
this benefit uh some do some don't or
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
none of them do and and uh why should
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
the state be taking over um paying for a
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
benefit that can be done and fought for
 
00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
at the municipal level thank you okay
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um I can't answer the I I
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
believe the first part of the question
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
um those
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
are uh the contracts are done
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
individually through each municipality
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
and there's um some firefighters here
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
who could probably speak to that I would
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
hope that once the project gets started
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
and they start the state will start this
 
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
and the state will pay that it will
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
become part of their contract over time
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm I'm hoping that happens
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
but we all know how that works out
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes other question
 
00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:01.870 align:start position:0%
sometimes other question
representative

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for bringing this bill
 
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:06.830 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for bringing this bill
before

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
us in regards to the funding mechanism
 
00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:11.799 align:start position:0%
if I look at say an average cost of
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
$1,000 per fighter fighter which is I
 
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.269 align:start position:0%
$1,000 per fighter fighter which is I
think

00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable given the fact there only $5
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
million in the if I do the math it's
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
5,000 firefighters is that going to be
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient to cover the number because
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
they can pay for it out of pocket my
 
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
concern is that once they pay for it out
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
of pocket if we run out of the money
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
because too many people get into the
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
line before they did that they won't
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to get the $1,000
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
back thank you um this did go through
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
Senate finance and they felt that um
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
there was an adequate amount of money to
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
to for this program thank
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Senator Donna
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester thank you very much Mr
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
the record Donna Susi I represent the
 
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
town of Lichfield and five Wards in the
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester um you have a lot of
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
good questions and a lot of technical
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions many of which I believe will
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
be answered by the folks that will
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
follow me so let me be very brief in
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
saying that um part of the reason I'm
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
here is as a a co-sponsor of the bill
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
this was truly a priority of the Senate
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
you have both the majority leader and
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
minority leader here this bill did go
 
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
through um the Health and Human Services
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee policy Committee in the Senate
 
00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
there was extensive testimony offered
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
about many of the technical aspects of
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
the bill questions were answered then um
 
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
it also went through the finance process
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
and the finance committee um and at each
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
stage it was unanimously supported I
 
00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:57.559 align:start position:0%
think what's most important to recognize
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
is that we're talking about about a
 
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
small and distinct population whose
 
00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:06.679 align:start position:0%
exposures to hazardous chemicals are 10
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
15 50 times more than what any of us
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
have and I know this committee has
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
considered a lot of legislation
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
surrounding pasas other hazardous
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
chemicals um the exposures that we're
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
talking about are like pasas on
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
steroids these individuals these men and
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
women who every day protect us in doing
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
their jobs are exposed to chemicals at
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
the scene of various sites and as was
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned by my colleague Senator Carson
 
00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
um we've now come to learn that the very
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
gear that they are wearing to protect
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
themselves also May in fact be causing
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
hazards um I think what's most important
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
though is that you listen to the folks
 
00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:51.559 align:start position:0%
that follow me um particularly you know
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
the chief of the fire department in
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um others are here that
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
will tell you about what's all already
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
been done to save lives and what's most
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
critical is that this bill will save
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
lives and will allow many of our brave
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
men and women to continue um in their
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
jobs and to continue to be able to go
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
home to their families at the end of the
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
day so with that I'd conclude my
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr chairman I I would take
 
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
questions but as I said I believe the
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
folks following me will be better able
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
to answer them with more specificity
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
okay and I also recognize your deadline
 
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you appreciate that are there
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
any quick questions that Senator Susi
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
might be able to representative Lon um
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator um just looking at
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
this policy-wise um obviously I'll hear
 
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
from the experts but if we come to the
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
ex with the four different areas covered
 
00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
the blood test the ultrasound screening
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
the lung CT and the skin cancer
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
screening um at least in my opinion the
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
first two are experimental and the
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
second are proven and life saving
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
if we were to come to the decision that
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
just limiting it to the proven and
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
life-saving ones right now and focusing
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
on the rest in the future would you
 
00:25:07.389 --> 00:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
believe that that would be a step
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
forward to help protect our firefighters
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
that we'd keep working on or would that
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
be a disappointment to you well I think
 
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
in part it would be a disappointment
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
because I believe some of these tests
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
have already been been run I I you know
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
recognize that you have concerns about
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
some of the diagnostic portion I believe
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
that the way the legislation is drafted
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
um that they would the committee formed
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
would be looking to various vendors uh
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
to provide the service and I think at
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
that point it would be the determination
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
of those experts what tests are needed
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
and what further tests are needed to
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
detect these cancers um I know you know
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
there are Physicians serving in the
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
legislature but I'm not one of them and
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
I would rather leave it to medical
 
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
professionals to make the determination
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
of what tests are need
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
needed any other questions for Senator
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
Susi thank you seeing gone thank you
 
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.149 align:start position:0%

standards and training and
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
EMS um I think obviously we'll be brief
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
um what I would think are we've
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
submitted some written testimony through
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
the um online submission this um
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday the Department of Safety
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
Division of fire safety and division of
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
fire stand EMS are supportive of this
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
bill uh as We Know cancer is becoming a
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
or is a leading cause of death among our
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
firefighters in across the country uh as
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
I was kind of reflecting on uh coming
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
here this morning um this afternoon I
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
have to go to a wake of a firefighter a
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire firefighter that died um
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
with complications of cancer um and he's
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
definitely not the only one you'll hear
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
some more a couple more stories later
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
but that's real life today and the other
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
thing I was thinking about as I was
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
getting ready this morning I've been to
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
four fire scenes um this week and we
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
heard about the carcinogens and things
 
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
like that but as I got ready and shower
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
this morning after I've showered after
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
every fire I've been through I still
 
00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559 align:start position:0%
have the odor of a fire scene on me
 
00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:38.919 align:start position:0%
after um after every day of clean
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
getting mult multiple showers every day
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
and I think that's to me it reminds me
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
of how much it lingers with us and the
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
after effects it has on us uh uh well
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
after the initial fire scene so um I
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
think that moving forward with this
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
program it's a great first step to to
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
protecting our First Responders and our
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
fire service in the state
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's important to mention the
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
call and volunteer that's a a huge
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
component of our state as well uh but I
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
I think is if we can take some first
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
steps and then bring it for you know
 
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
continue to advance this as we go and we
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
learn is is very important to help
 
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
protect those that protect us so uh I
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
don't want to go on too much further
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer some questions
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
but thank you thank you very
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman I just want to add to
 
00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
the Marshall's comments that um within
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
this bill it gives the respons
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
posibility for the program to the
 
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety specifically our
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
division and I want the committee to
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
know that we are committed to working
 
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
within the committee outlined in this
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
bill and administratively to making this
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
program successful thank you thank you
 
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:46.519 align:start position:0%
representative shapo has a question go
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
ahead thank thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if it it's possible to say
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
but um having recently come across a
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
house you know fully o Blaze and the um
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
the smell was unbelievable um is it
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
possible to say to what extent the
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
cancer risk is a result of um chemicals
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
used to put out fires and protective
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
clothing versus the
 
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
actual stuff that's burning that fire
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters are trying to put
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
out sure thank you I I would suggest
 
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
It's a combination of all of those
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
things you heard from the Senators I
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
mean our gear that we wear our clothing
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we both have on now have some level
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
of past in them uh there's lots of
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
efforts to move forward to uh replace
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
those with different Alternatives but
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
there's definitely the synthetics are in
 
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
the that we have in our homes uh the
 
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
chemicals they're putting in our our
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
Fabrics whether it's our furniture our
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
mattresses um you know that that help
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
prevent the flammability then when they
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
when they do burn give off gasing to
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
that are cancer causing so I think it's
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
a combination of both and I I I don't
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question thank you for
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
being here today and thank you for all
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
you do um having had a house burn once
 
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
the fire Marshall's office
 
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
is very
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
helpful um so my question is with the
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
actual drafting of the bill uh as we
 
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
have heard at least one of my colleagues
 
00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:29.799 align:start position:0%
has a concern about part of the bill as
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
it is currently
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
drafted and so my question for you is if
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
the two sections I'm I'm going to ask
 
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
this in multiple Parts if I may Mr
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr chairman because I just
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
looking at drafting issues um if we
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
simply removed the part on lines 8
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
through 10 that says or 8 through 13
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
that has those two pro procedures that
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
says vendors who can do these procedures
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
are preferred if we were to remove
 
00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:09.799 align:start position:0%
that is that a good thing or a bad thing
 
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
or how would you feel about
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
it I would ask someone from behind me
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
there speak to they're much more up to
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
speed on that component of the of the
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
bill fair enough and and um so I will
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
not ask you my follow-up questions which
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
are all in the same vein so so thank you
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
very much for taking the question other
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lon um thank
 
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you both for
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
what you do for the state and for people
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
and for being here um my question is if
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
the department of safety has people with
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
uh medical back background technology
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
and experience to be able to evaluate um
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
choosing given the number of employees
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
within the department I can't accurately
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
answer that question I think our
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
intention is to to work within the
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
committee established in this bill
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
identify those vendors um those
 
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
different types of tests that that may
 
00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:08.519 align:start position:0%
fall in line with the legislation and
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
then really just make this program you
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
know as positive and successful as we
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
can thank you representative
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you and thank you for
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I don't know if
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
it's a question for your department but
 
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
I just wonder if you have specific uh uh
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire statistics for
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
firefighters in New Hampshire what kind
 
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
of cancers they experience if we see any
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
years I'm not aware of any specific New
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire study but I think this program
 
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
part of the goal of it is to um identify
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
any uniqueness to New Hampshire to help
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
improve both in training and other
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
preventative techniques and methods
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair um following
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
up on represent Weber um comment about
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
the lines 8 through 13 also looking at
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
lines 23 through 30 what I'm trying to
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
get to is rep Leon touched upon it is
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
somebody within the group has the
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert to what tests need
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
to be done to actually make it
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
meaningful so right now I don't see any
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
any any one in that list that has what I
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
call subject matter
 
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
expertise um to be sure that what's
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
going to the governor for
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations not just about the
 
00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:39.559 align:start position:0%
process but the fact the test that we're
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
clinically I think uh maybe we could ask
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
U Brian will might who was instrumental
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
he's here going to testify this morning
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
but um I mean I think I would assume
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
that if we can find someone that would
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
help benefit the group in moving this
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
forward that we wouldn't want to
 
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:04.519 align:start position:0%
entertain that would be my take but um
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know I think our the fire service is
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
very interested in moving this forward
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
to try to help protect us the earli
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
early screenings and detection is proven
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
to be successful um and that's I think
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
the most important thing that we're
 
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
asking for your support and making
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
happen Mr R is signed up to speak and he

that the very gear that firefighters

mentioned earlier and those in this room

today taking matters into their own

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
companies fire departments across the
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
state have developed best practices
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines and policies to reduce the

exposure to these cancer-causing agents
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
and while we've seen a significant
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
cultural shift in the fire service to
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate these exposures firefighters
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
continue to die from cancer at an

alarming rate
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
the plan we bring before you today is
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
not one that we're hoping will reduce
 
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
these firefighter cancer deaths but one
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
that has already been tested and proven
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
to be successful each one of these
 
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.550 align:start position:0%
to be successful each one of these

diagnostic
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
tests uh detects cancer signals through
 
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
various parts of the
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
body a simple blood draw has been proven
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
effective at identifying 21 possible
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
cancer signal Origins that detect nearly
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
50 types of cancer throughout the body
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
you could start wrapping up please I
 
00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.309 align:start position:0%
you could start wrapping up please I
will

00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
I you know what I will cut it short
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
because I think that there are people
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
behind me that can uh testify to the
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
impact of these tests uh a little more
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
personally but I would like to uh answer
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of the questions that were
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
asked if I may sure um uh thank you
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative for your questions I am
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
not a uh a physician or or a clinical
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
expert um my apologies for not bringing
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
in uh Dr Hamrock um who is the uh
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
clinician out of Boston that we brought
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
in before the Senate was able to testify
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
to um the clinical validity of all of
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
these tests um and I just do want to
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
point out um a simple Google search will
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
show you um through oncology testing um
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
that these these tests have been proven
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
to detect cancer signals regardless of
 
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not they are FDA approved at
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
this point it is less than an
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
experimental test we have firefighters
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the country that have been
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
found to have cancer through
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
specifically the blood testing um
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
firefighters in Virginia Beach
 
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
firefighters in San Francisco this test
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
has worked and what it does is it
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
provides a cancer signal it doesn't tell
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
you that you have this type of cancer it
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
provides a signal that enables you to
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
get a follow-up testing that will
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
determine further what that cancer is
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
there was a firefighter in Virginia
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
Beach specifically um that had this this
 
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
blood test done they they detected a
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
cancer signal in his blood test he went
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
for further follow on testing and it was
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
found that he had esophageal cancer and
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
he didn't even have any symptoms so
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of uh the testing
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
phase um these tests have been proven to
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
work so much so that the organization
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
that represents nearly 350,000
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
firefighters in this country are using
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
it um so we would ask to keep the bill
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
um um to keep all parts all aspects of
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
the bill within it um we do not want to
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
damage the Integrity of the testing and
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
I would just remind you just to to
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
finish up here this is a pilot program
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're not asking the state to move
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
forward with this testing or any part of
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
it for a long-term cause we're asking
 
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.829 align:start position:0%
it for a long-term cause we're asking
for

00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
onetime testing funds so that we can
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
compile data that's necessary to look at
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
how we want to build along term program
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Lon um thank
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you very much
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
for addressing that um I did read the
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Senate hearing um
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
were was he speaking to the gallery test
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
as being the tested impr proven blood
 
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
test that's the one he mentioned in his
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
testimony so yes okay thank you um as a
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
followup um that one's showing some
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
signals but it it definitely is not um I
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
guess I I have question about whether
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
about your classification of it as
 
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
tested and proven I do um
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
um so thank you sure other questions
 
00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.910 align:start position:0%
um so thank you sure other questions
representative

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
McLean oh I'm sorry representative Weber
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
no no no problem okay yeah
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
my thank you
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
um my question would be um the more
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
specific drafting issues
 
00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
um I think you've answered what would
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
have been my first one uh but I noticed
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
that in the packet from the professional
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
firefighters which was submitted to us
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they have asked
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
to remove from the bill as currently
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
drafted is to Simply strike out the skin
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
cancer screening and I'm wondering why
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
you want to strike that out sure thank
 
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:53.559 align:start position:0%
you representative for your question um
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
I would like to stress that we don't
 
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
want to strike that out because we don't
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
think that this in a vital piece of the
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
testing the only reason we would want to
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
consider striking that out is because uh
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
we have found uh in doing our due
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
diligence early on to work with um
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that might be involved in
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
this process moving forward what we've
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
determined is that all of our
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
firefighters in the state currently have
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
access with minimal barriers to a
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
Dermatology exam um just by a referral
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
of their PCP
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
um it's a very easy test to get anyone
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
in this room should you have I would say
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
average health insurance would approve
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
that test uh again with very minimal
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
barriers um and without uh having we're
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
trying to be purposeful and responsible
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
with the state's funds here um and we
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that it would be
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
necessary uh for the state to pay for
 
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
that test uh when it's so easy easily
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
covered under health insurance could I
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
have a followup um second followup from
 
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
that part of the um Bill if we were to
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
remove the section on lines 8 to13
 
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
requiring the preference for vendors
 
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
with the ability to test for the
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
following and simply left
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
in uh The Language online six and seven
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
that consists of a blood test an
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
ultrasound of violet or VI of vital
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
organs and a CT if
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
indicated how would that be for
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
you so you would strike out um vendors
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
with the ability to test uh for the
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
following shall be preferred and then
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't have the lines
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
numbered so up to where first of all I
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't strike it at all but I'm trying
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
to figure out with a minimum of Time how
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
to draft a
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
might be acceptable to people um so I'm
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out what
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
individuals positions are on various
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill for drafting purposes
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
so um my question now that thank you you
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
can give me the lines again to
 
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro for the line
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
numbered copy um it's the this I'm
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
asking you about the lines from 8 to 13
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
which are the ones that say these
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
particular vendors will be
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
preferred and my question is if instead
 
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
of specifying that and simply saying
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
that the cancer screening will consist
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
of a blood test ultrasound and the lung
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
CT if indicated because you've indicated
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
that you don't you're not concerned
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
about the cancer screening so much the
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
skin cancer screening um is that an
 
00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.109 align:start position:0%
skin cancer screening um is that an
acceptable

00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
way to go or does
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
that do you feel that that leaves out a
 
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
vital piece of what you want to see in
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
the bill sure thank you for your
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
question I think I understand it now um
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
I think that if that was what was going
 
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
to be satisfactory to the committee that
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
we would be agreeable to that um the
 
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
reason that we had uh those lines in
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
there was to try and nail down a little
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
bit more specifically what it is that we
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
were looking for but as I understand it
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
um that could always be developed and
 
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
presented um through the committee's
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
work um and then ultimately identified
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
through an RFP process through the state
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
um so as long as we were to maintain the
 
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
Integrity uh of lines 5 through S I
 
00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:46.839 align:start position:0%
would be agreeable to those Chang and
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
including the skin cancer screening or
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
ex or without the skin to remove the
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
skin cancer screening and Mr chair may
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
may I have one more it's not quite a
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
followup but uh it is with the
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
submission of the professional
 
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
firefighters packet so my question would
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
be uh the other thing that I think you
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
were willing to that you were asking to
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
have stricken was on uh later on and
 
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
again I don't have the line numbers on
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
it but under Roman five striking not to
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
exceed a cost of 1,300 per ex per
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
individual and so my question is why
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
strike that and how much per individual
 
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
is it estimated that an adequate
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
screening might cost sure thank you for
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
your question um the reason we struck
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
that is we were doing um this is not a
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
program I I should say that we developed
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
from scratch we got this from other uh
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
iff State organizations that are doing
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
it New Jersey specifically has a program
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
in place um that is functioning very
 
00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
similar to what this is um we had gotten
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
the $1,300 number from them um just by
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the vendors that
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
offered some of these tests doing some
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
simple addition and finding out what the
 
00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
cost might be what we've determined is
 
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
that uh like everything else the costs
 
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
of tests go up over time we don't want
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
to paint ourselves into a corner and
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
then find that we can't offer all of
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
these tests within that
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
$1,300 cap um so what we like to do is
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
maintain the overall cost of the bill
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
because we still believe that that will
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
be enough to cover the testing for all
 
00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
firefighters in in the state um but
 
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
should costs be adjusted for any
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
specific tests over time then this would
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
not handcuff us under the 1300 so what
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
we would propose is just to scratch that
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and keep it open thank you very much
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
for those answers representative McLean
 
00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:52.799 align:start position:0%
and then representative McKay thank you
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
question so um this is obviously not the
 
00:48:58.990 --> 00:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
first time that this has been done so
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
you're you're building this program upon
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
things that you say have worked in other
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
areas Virginia Beach San Francisco um
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned New Jersey so in my
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
first question would be in those cases
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
is they're doing all of this in those
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
cases um you know or are they doing
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
parts of it or are they doing all of it
 
00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming they're doing all of it but
 
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
um but then my other question is having
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
done that that's going to going to be a
 
00:49:29.069 --> 00:49:29.079 align:start position:0%
pretty large statistical sampling this
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
is we're talking large population
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
centers um so can you speak to any
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
statistical shift in in the incident
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
rates of Occupational cancer you're
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
talking about 75% here it's great to
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
have anecdotal data but it would be nice
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
to understand you know are we seeing a
 
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
statistically significant benefit from
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
this in those jurisdictions where this
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
has already been tried thank you sure
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um I
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to give you statistical
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
numbers um and really anything aside
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
from anecdotal but what I would tell you
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
is New Jersey is the only state so far
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of in the iff that has a
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive program that includes all
 
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
of these pieces um that that was a uh a
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
first of its kind we have taken their
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
model which is proven to be successful
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
and built off of that um to bring it
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I will tell you
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
that um the International Association of
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
firefighters is paying attention to New
 
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire very very closely right now um
 
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're able to be
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
successful in this because this is the
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
model program that they want developed
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
they have um chief medical officers on
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
staff they have done the scientific
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
research behind this that I cannot do um
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
to prove that this does work just uh I I
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
will give you one um one number um there
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
were of the testing that was done in New
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
Jersey there were 21 ultrasound
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
Diagnostics that were proven to have
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
findings so um somewhat significant
 
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
based on you know when you look at
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're going to provide
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
these tests or we're not to our personal
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
position is if you can save one
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
firefighter through this testing process
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
then this process has been successful um
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
to to talk about 21 in the state of New
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
Jersey um is fairly
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
significant followup so um but did did
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
New Jersey have a a finished report come
 
00:51:40.109 --> 00:51:40.119 align:start position:0%
out and is that something that we could
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
maybe have an opportunity to look at um
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
we might be able to find some
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
preliminary data for you but the tests
 
00:51:46.559 --> 00:51:47.910 align:start position:0%
preliminary data for you but the tests
are

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
ongoing but um Ju Just the further uh
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
answer your question there are states
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the country that have done
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
done portions of these tests um some
 
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
have brought in for instance uh the
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
gallery blood testing um and they've had
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
success in determining cancers there
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
some have brought in ultrasound
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
diagnostic they've had success
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
determining cancers there we've actually
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
had some communities within the state
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
buy into this and bring them in for
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
themselves so that also will help Drive
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
the cost down some uh conquered for
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
instance is one of them uh they provided
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
ultrasound diagnostics for their members
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
um at the municipal level so we would
 
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
not have to then further test those
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
members um if it was in within a certain
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
period of
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
time thank you representative McKay and
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
then representative kofel thank you Mr
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
chairman uh this is a fairly simple
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
question I think I heard you say you
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
wanted us to keep this bill and that
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
would mean that we would retain it and I
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
think you meant that we passed this bill
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
we can't retain it representative it's a
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
that can't be done this yeah and I I
 
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:08.799 align:start position:0%
just I just wanted to be very clear that
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
he wanted to pass this Bill yes uh to be
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
very clear yes we're asking you to pass
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
it my my apologies for not word smithing
 
00:53:16.119 --> 00:53:16.990 align:start position:0%
it my my apologies for not word smithing
it

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
correctly representative kofalt and then
 
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.870 align:start position:0%
correctly representative kofalt and then
representative

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
Lon thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um how many uh
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
the the bill refers to permanent
 
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
firefighter which I assume means kind of
 
00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:33.799 align:start position:0%
a full-time career firefighter not a
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
volunteer um how many permanent
 
00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
firefighters are there in the state of
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh so we would be working
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
off of the New Hampshire retirement
 
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
system numbers and it's approximately
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
4,000 okay so that's include active plus
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
retired correct okay uh followup
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
followup um so I understand that um
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
since 20 10 most most health insurance
 
00:54:04.109 --> 00:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
plans have covered certain kinds of
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
cancer screenings and early cancer
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
detection um how much overlap is there
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
or I I guess my my question is could
 
00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
These funds or would These funds be used
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
to pay for screenings that are already
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
available through healthare coverage
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
employer employer based healthc care
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
coverage for these firefighters thank
 
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
great question um I would say that the
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is the reason for the desire to
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
strike out the Dermatology exam because
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
we don't want that overlap again we're
 
00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:39.799 align:start position:0%
trying to be responsible um with State
 
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
funding here uh but to my knowledge and
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
and what we've been able to to determine
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
working with the Physicians um and the
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
insurance companies these are not tests
 
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
that are covered unless you have um
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
symptoms so if you were to go to your
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
PCP and have some sort of symptom that
 
00:54:59.309 --> 00:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
would drive you to get a blood test or
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
an ultrasound or a lung CT um then they
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
would send you otherwise it would not be
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
indicated uh representative Lon defers
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you m Mr chairman also
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you taking the question in New
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
Jersey I heard that there's a chief
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
medical officer somebody's a subject
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
matter expert when I look through in
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
lines 23 through
 
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
27 I don't see reference to a subject
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
matter expert amongst the group so if
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking for medical expertise to
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
help make sort of a fundamental decision
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
on what test should be done to If It
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
Strike if you will 8 through
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
13 where do you think that expertise
 
00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
should come from or should it be
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
somebody in this bill that is going to
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
be a subject matter expert to help guide
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
the firefighter
 
00:55:59.470 --> 00:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you for your question
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
um so this is somewhat interesting so
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
last year um we had Senate Bill 71 which
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
came before um the uh houseing DNA as
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
part of that we had put in a commission
 
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
to study uh offering cancer
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
screenings and by and large we were told
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
by uh the house
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
that we should not have a commission on
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
this in fact it should come from the
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
firefighters doing their research and
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
bringing forward the program that has
 
00:56:35.789 --> 00:56:35.799 align:start position:0%
proven to work um so we were told in
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
that process that it was our
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to meet with subject
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
matter experts to determine what the
 
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
best possible testing was to offer we
 
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
have done that which is why we you know
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
we didn't just create this out of thin
 
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
air we've we've met with Physicians that
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
have told us that this this
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list of testing um when
 
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
all pieced together is the best possible
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
screening on the market um
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question they are not
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
within here only because we've done our
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
research up to this point um but if it
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
makes all of you more comfortable um to
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
add in a subject matter expert then
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's to that's completely appropriate
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
otherwise we were just planning to go
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
about um working with the folks that
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
have steered us up until this point
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
up if we delete the reference to the um
 
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
8 through 13 those are things that
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
basically have been recommended by a
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert to the group so
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
how would we replace that if we don't
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
have someone that the firefighter is
 
00:57:51.309 --> 00:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
going to work with within the subject
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
matter itself if we no if we don't
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
become prescriptive and more descriptive
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
then I'm just concerned that we don't
 
00:57:59.950 --> 00:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
have the ability of having the knowledge
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
base if you need to replace those test
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
sure um I would agree with that and
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
quite frankly as it came up earlier I
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
had mentioned that um if it
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
was it was something that we could work
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
with within the committee um something
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
that we could work with as part of the
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
RFP process um even if this committee
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
chose to strike those lines uh that
 
00:58:27.069 --> 00:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
information is still there and available
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
to tell us that this is ultimately um
 
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
what we would want to be looking for so
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
if there was an RFP drafted or the
 
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
committee determined that these are the
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
pieces that we were looking for that
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
took priority then we could still
 
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.470 align:start position:0%
took priority then we could still
utilize

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
that representative Lon and then
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber um thank you Mr
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um so um you said that New
 
00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839 align:start position:0%
Jersey already passed a law like this
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
but when I pull that up and I pull up
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
the bill that was passed in 2021
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
their their law looks very very
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
different than what was proposed here um
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
so if you're building off that expertise
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand the disconnect
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
um between that and your bill um but I
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
guess probably more importantly if we
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
were to strike lines 8 through 13 which
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
is about the um Gallery test and the
 
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
ultrasound um are you saying that it
 
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
would it would be done
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
anyways I'm not saying that it would be
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
done I'm saying that if the
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
funds were approved in this bill were to
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
pass and we were looking for um and we
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
weren't to strike uh that the test would
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
consist of a blood test an ultrasound of
 
00:59:38.109 --> 00:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
vital organs or lung CT
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
that this process would have to go
 
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
through the states RFP process and that
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
would go out to bid and subsequently
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
someone other than me would be making
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
the determination as to the vendors that
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
would be chosen I'm not saying it would
 
00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
be gallery or it could be D with
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock it could be Elliott um
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
whoever's willing to provide these tests
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
um would be who I assume the state would
 
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
choose um as for the New Jersey
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
testing um like I said that's still in
 
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
process their testing is but as far as
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
their law is concerned it's broken up a
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
couple of different ways because some of
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
them have um State funed Healthcare some
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
of them don't um some of them have
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
private healthcare so they've actually
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
had to piece together some of these
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
tests in order to make it work um New
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would certainly be leading the
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
way as far as um I would say without
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
sounding offensive an organized plan for
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
this testing um so we would be uh a
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
first in first in the nation in that
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
respect thank you other questions
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative palazov uh thank you Mr
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
question uh I I wonder if you can uh
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
follow up with sending committee uh any
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
data you have specific to New Hampshire
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
and uh cancer types uh um that five
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
Fighters uh struggling here and uh uh
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
also professional firefighters of New
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire provided us with firefighter
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
cancer risk chat is my understanding
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
correct the those numbers are National
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
and not just for New Hampshire do you
 
01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:26.950 align:start position:0%
and not just for New Hampshire do you
know

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
correct and that's information I think
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's cited on the bottom where that K
 
01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:31.950 align:start position:0%
it's cited on the bottom where that K
comes

01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
comes
 
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
from other
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
Christopher Wyman I believe New
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%

Association if I'm reading those
initials

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
initials
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
correctly okay
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
you ask for five minutes sir if you
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
could keep it closer to three I'd
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate it absolutely sir good
 
01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
morning and thank you for actually
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
putting on this hearing today my name is
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
Chris Wyman um I'm a 32-year member of
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire fire service I'm a
 
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
lieutenant currently with the marac fire
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
department and the first vice president
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire State fireman's
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm here today standing
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
before you to support and hopefully you
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
guys will pass this bill um the New
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State fireman's Association
 
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
represents approximately 3 uh 3600
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
career call and volunteer firefighters
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
01:02:32.029 --> 01:02:32.039 align:start position:0%
and as what's been said earlier today
 
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
this is a necessary first step for what
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
we need to do to battle cancer and
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters I'm also here today for
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
another reason on January 5th 2023 my
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
wife who was a 26e member of the New
 
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fire servic as well a ASA
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
firefighter was diagnosed with lung
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
cancer on November 28th 2023 she died
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
from occupational cancer that was
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
directly related to her being a
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
firefighter in the state of New
 
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and for the city of nsha so if
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
you guys are looking for a reason to
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
pass a bill like this I'm here before
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
you to say you know what a family has to
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
go through what a firefighter has to go
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
through through this you guys want to
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
talk about the screenings and all that
 
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
stuff my wife for the years she was at
 
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
nsha she went through she was a
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
firefighter she was on the HazMat team
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
she was a member of the dive team nsha
 
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
fire requires annual physicals annual
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
chest x-rays pulmonary function tests
 
01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
blood tests especially for the members
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
of the HazMat team
 
01:03:38.029 --> 01:03:38.039 align:start position:0%
those physicals did not detect her
 
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
cancer by the time we found out she had
 
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
cancer the doctors thought she had
 
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
pneumonia you talk about the screening
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
parts that are part of this bill the and
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
the insurance that goes into it
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
Insurance wants you to go through the
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
through the leest cost thing first and
 
01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
that's what my wife experienced she had
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
to go through through chest x-rays
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
multiple chest x-rays they didn't go to
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
a CAT scan on her chest in her lungs
 
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:04.039 align:start position:0%
until it was determined that all right
 
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
we went through chest x-rays in
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
September we went through chest x-rays
 
01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
in November we went through courses of
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
treatment to to address pneumonia and
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
things like that and it still didn't
 
01:04:16.029 --> 01:04:16.039 align:start position:0%
work and then finally the insurance
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
company said sure we'll approve a CAT
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
scan once that CAT scan was done yeah
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
there was no doubt but by that point so
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
we went through through months of going
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
through this but at that point my wife
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with and bear with me cuz
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
I'm going to screw up the name art
 
01:04:36.269 --> 01:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
ardino carcinoma non- small non-s small
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
cell lung cancer that was aggressive in
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
nature that by the time she was
 
01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
diagnosed she had stage for and was
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
mestic cancer to her
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
bones so to go through that treatment to
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
talk about those blood tests her doctors
 
01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:54.279 align:start position:0%
at Mass General her doctors at Dana
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
Farber all you used those if you don't
 
01:04:59.549 --> 01:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
want to say they're not FDA tests they
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
used those blood tests to not only
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
Define the type of cancer she had but to
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
actually go after the proper treatment
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
and hoping to cure her cancer
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that didn't work we like
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
to say that she had the Dream Team
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who from Mass General Dr narges
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
Flores from Dana Farber Dr Flores is
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
probably one of the leading oncologists
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
for women in lung cancer
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
and especially firefighters and deployed
 
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
military personnel and she was my wife's
 
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
leading oncologist and every time Dr
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
Flores would say hey we know this blood
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
test or this or whatever it's not FDA
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
approved but it's going to help us with
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
clinical trials it's going to help us
 
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
better Define things for you and stuff
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
like that so A bill like this yeah
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
should fire departments in municipality
 
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide have this as part of their
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
program 100 100% but we have to start
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere the data has to come from
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere and like like I said using
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
typical fire department physicals today
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
they're not covering these things
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
insurance companies aren't necessarily
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
covering these things they're not
 
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
covering them until such time as
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
something comes up and then they say all
 
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
right we're going to move forward from
 
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
here even though my wife had lung cancer
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
even though she was already diagnosed
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
with that every single time we came up
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
with a PET scan so every 90 days she had
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
to go through a pet scan but because of
 
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
the insurance can't do the Pet Scan
 
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
first we got to go back to chest x-rays
 
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
we got to go back to CAT scans and then
 
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
if we don't get the data off from those
 
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
then we can do a pet scan what she
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
needed every 90 days a pet scan we had
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
to go through all that stuff all over
 
01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:46.119 align:start position:0%
again every single
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
time so I ask I really do I know the
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
bills a lot it's a $5 million price tag
 
01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
I think like I said heavy been in the
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
fire service myself having accepted the
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
risk that these guys have all talked
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
about today myself being exposed to the
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
carcinogenic smoke being exposed to the
 
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
fire scenes as not only a firefighter I
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
was a fire and explosion investigator
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
having represented and done line of duty
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
death investigations in the state now I
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
get to sit on the other side of that
 
01:07:15.359 --> 01:07:16.190 align:start position:0%
get to sit on the other side of that
same

01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
table because my wife was determined to
 
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
be her cancer was determined to be
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
occupational related so now today I come
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
before you sitting on both sides of that
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
table not only is a firefight fighter
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
but as a spouse and a
 
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
Survivor and I hope you guys do my
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
wife's birthday was the 22nd which was
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
Monday so it would be a great gift if
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
this committee passed this Bill thank
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you chairman thank you
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you I I'm so sorry for
 
01:07:45.309 --> 01:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
your wife's loss thank you for her
 
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
service and your service thank you um um
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate why it's so personal and
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
why it's such a challenge for you um but
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
I I do want to know that those blood
 
01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
tests were pretty different I'm sure as
 
01:07:59.230 --> 01:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
a firefighter you know not all chemical
 
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
fires are the same abut not all blood
 
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
tests are the same so I hope you
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
understand that I'm talk we're talking
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
this The Spill is talking about a very
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
different blood test than what those
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
experts and your wife was treated by the
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
experts because I know that field so she
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
was very lucky to have that exposure but
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
I hope you understand it's a very
 
01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
different test than what's asked for in
 
01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
this bill I do and that was how it
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
started though you got to remember that
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
started with not thinking that was
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
cancer at all and we had to start
 
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere and those those simple blood
 
01:08:27.309 --> 01:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
test that they're talking about this how
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
they started with us and when the
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
markers came up and going through
 
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
everything else she went through
 
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
numerous blood tests at the beginning
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
you know and even procedures to
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
determine what she had how she had it
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
where was it everything else but right
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
so she had the gallery test she did
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Seth King thank
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for your
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
testimony I am very sorry to hear about
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
your loss thank you um assuming this
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
bill goes through and we get all the the
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
data that everybody's looking for do you
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
then expect to
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
see um the sorts of screenings funded by
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
the state or then do you expect the
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities to finally start stepping
 
01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
up and fulfilling more of their role
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
financially to do this I hope the data
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
that comes out of this I mean with any
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
with any pilot program call it a beta
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
test or even if you just follow the
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
scientific method you got to you got to
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
collect data to be able to create what's
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
that permanent solution going to look
 
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
like um do I expect the state to do to
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
do it all by themselves I don't I think
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
the data needs to be driven it's got to
 
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
start somewhere and if this means rather
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
than by the state doing this part part
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
of it we get to look at the State of New
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not just one or two
 
01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
specific communities or jurisdictions
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
that might decide to do it so at least
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
if we do this and a 24-month program and
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
we can have that broad of a reach at
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
least it's a start and then like I said
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
at the end they can better Define okay
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
what will local jurisdictions have to do
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
and whether that's for career
 
01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
departments or even departments that are
 
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer and do they now start
 
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
requiring physicals and the cancer
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
scheming as well for call and volunteer
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
firefighters as well which is just as
 
01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
important thank you representative Paz
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
off thank you Mr chair uh sorry for your
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
loss and thank you for for your service
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh I have a question about uh prices for
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
those tests if you have any idea you
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned that some test are not uh
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
covered until something uh comes up or
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
some tests are not uh some scans are not
 
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh performed uh until after x-ray is
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
performed so if you can give me any idea
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
how much I'm bet on acronyms but you
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned cat and I believe pet scans uh
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
what kind of pricing we we are looking
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
with those tests the pricing I sorry I I
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
don't know uh I mean alls I can speak to
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
I mean it was a it's a it's a hefty
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
price tag um can I break down what each
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
individual test cost I I can't um as an
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
exam I mean if you want an example just
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
one months of just appointments I mean I
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
got a bill I got a bill last month for
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
Mass General it's $111,000 that my
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
insurance company didn't didn't cover
 
01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
you know so it's it and that's month
 
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
after month after month and my wife's
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
been gone six months almost so I mean it
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a hefty price tag on
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
families and all that stuff because
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
insurance insurance doesn't necessarily
 
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
cover all of
 
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and I too am sorry for
 
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
your loss and and thank you and your
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
wife for being the people that you
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
are um I want to be sure I understand
 
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
what the timeline was with your wife's
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
treatment you said that she had the
 
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
gallery test but she did not have it am
 
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
I right in understanding that she didn't
 
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
have it until
 
01:12:16.629 --> 01:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
significantly after she had already
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
exhibited symptoms which were initially
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
Miss diagnosed as as pneumonia is that
 
01:12:25.229 --> 01:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct so am I also
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
correct in thinking that had she had
 
01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.070 align:start position:0%
correct in thinking that had she had
that

01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
test prior to developing
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
symptoms her outcome might have been
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
different the last part of that's a
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
pretty broad reach I we don't know yeah
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't know um I I can tell you that
 
01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
her oncologists wished that tests like
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
the gallery test were performed as
 
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
yearly physicals okay and maybe that
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
would give um you know cuz again she's
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
being a member of the fire department
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
but also the HazMat team and all that
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
stuff they did additional blood tests to
 
01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
you know are they exposed heavy metals
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
are they exposed other toxins stuff like
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
that but you know that was one of the
 
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
thing that both Doctor Who and Dr Flor
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
has talked about was they wish that
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
tests like that were in fact given on an
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
annual basis that maybe would provide
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
the benchmarks of the flags or whatever
 
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
that would say hey there's a problem and
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
we need and we need to look into this
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
further just so just as a follow follow
 
01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
up so what we're really looking at here
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
is that the these tests as specified in
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
the bills would provide a an early
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
warning system so that further uh tests
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
could be done and have a justification
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
for it that's the goal thank you thank
 
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
you very much again we're sorry for your
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%

thank you committee members for having
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
us here today I'm going to try to
 
01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
can I'm here to testify and support of
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 352 which will provide
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
cancer screenings for all active and
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
retired firefighters the Manchester fire
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%

01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
the Manchester professional firefighter
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
Association developed the pilot program
 
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
for early detection cancer
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
screenings the goal of this pilot
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
program is to show proof of of concept
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
based on statistical data that showed
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
that lung cancer and skin cancer are two
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
of the most prevalent cancers amongst
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
firefighters Nationwide it was
 
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
determined that a Dermatology screening
 
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
along with a lung
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
CT was the best course of action this
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
Baseline screening will act as a
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
foundation for all future
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
screenings we started with a full
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
Dermatology screening offered to every
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
firefighter in the city totaling 204
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
members with 184 members agreeing to be
 
01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:25.629 align:start position:0%
members with 184 members agreeing to be
screened

01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
which is over 90% of the department
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock mobilized a team of
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
dermatologists and we screened 184
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
members in 5 days of the 184 22
 
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters were scheduled for a
 
01:15:38.629 --> 01:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
followup with a Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
dermatologist the initial criteria if
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
the lung CT screening was 40 years old
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
with 10 years firefighting service 130
 
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:47.719 align:start position:0%
members met this initial criteria and we
 
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
screened 125 members which is over
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
96% of the 125 members screen we had
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
third 32 incidental findings from the
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
screenings and those members were
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
encouraged to follow up with the PCP an
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
additional 16 members referred to
 
01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
pulmonary at Dartmouth Hitchcock for a
 
01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up appointment of the 16 referred
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
to pulmonary 14 fell into what they call
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
a category 3 or a category
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
4 that's a total of 48 members of the
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
125 that needed some sort of follow-up
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
care which comes out to 38% of the
 
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
members that were screened
 
01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
we are currently working with DAR to
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
schedule all remaining members for a
 
01:16:29.159 --> 01:16:30.550 align:start position:0%
schedule all remaining members for a
long

01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
long
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
screening as stated earlier the goal is
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
to show proof of concept and we live in
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
a world filled with Statistics and data
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
today the statistic that matters most is
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
how many lives are saved this pilot
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
program has already saved One Life due
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
to the early detection cancer screening
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
program one Manchester firefighter was
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with stage two
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
cancer Fire Marshall Pete lon's cancer
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
was detected Ed and diagnosed at an
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
early stage and with a successful
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
operation at Dartmouth Hitchcock to
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
remove his cancer completely he was able
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
to return to work cancer-free in less
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
than four
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
weeks Fire Marshall lennin is alive
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
today because of the screening provided
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
his wife and daughters didn't lose a
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
husband and a father and there's no
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
better example of how early detection
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
can save
 
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
lives the statistical data is empirical
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
firefighters are going to be diagnosed
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
with cancer and it is a question of when
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
not if with this is the only reasonable
 
01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
conclusion it comes down to a question
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
of cost as the fire chief of the state's
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
largest Department I entirely understand
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
what it means to work within a budget
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
this program has a price and I take that
 
01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.430 align:start position:0%
this program has a price and I take that
very

01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
seriously however I urge you we cannot
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
look at this in a vacuum to per form of
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
a complete cost analysis it will not be
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
just the cost of the screenings versus
 
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
the cost of cancer treatment the
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
analysis must also consider how long a
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
firefighter will be out of work and the
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
impact on operations it also must
 
01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
consider the emotional and mental
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
fatigue it puts on a department all of
 
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
these factors need to be taken into
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
account firefighters are going to do
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
their jobs they will risk their lives
 
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
and perform aggressive interior
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
firefighting knowing that they are not
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
only risking their lives in the fire
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
ground but also putting their health at
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
risk every day they will still do their
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
jobs it is not what we do it is Who We
 
01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.149 align:start position:0%
jobs it is not what we do it is Who We
Are

01:18:25.149 --> 01:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
Are
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
my job as fire chief is simple make sure
 
01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
my members have the tools they need to
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
do their job I am here today to do that
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure every firefighter in the
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
state receives a baseline early
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
detection cancer screening we've shown
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
it can be done and the statistics show
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
it can be
 
01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
done I heard you all to support Senate
 
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 352 let's ensure that we provide
 
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
the necessary tools for firefighters to
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
do their jobs which is to save lives and
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
property I want to say thank you and
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
understand if some of you have some
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
questions I would love to answer them
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative Seth King and then
 
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you Mr chair
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony you're
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
probably the exact person I'm looking to
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
get the qu the question answered um it
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
sounds like manchest city of
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester's really led the way on these
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
these screenings um do you know uh where
 
01:19:15.629 --> 01:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
that came from did that come from the
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester's budget did that
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
come out of your budget did it come from
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
insurance who paid for that I can answer
 
01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
that question uh the screenings were
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
done um Dartmouth Hitchcock paid for all
 
01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
the screenings to be done we had very
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
intense conversations with Dartmouth
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock um and they were willing to do
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
this at no cost to us um as they once we
 
01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
showed them the data of the cancer wide
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh the cancer firefighters are getting
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
Nationwide they understood the
 
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
importance of this they understood that
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
we were trying to also pass a bill
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
moving forward and then they understood
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
that we want to show proof of concept
 
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
and that proved concept was that we can
 
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
do these screenings you know it is going
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
to show results and it is needed mhm uh
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up okay thank you for
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
that response excellent um assuming we
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
go through with this bill in the future
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
who do you see footing the bill for the
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
screenings I mean Dartmouth Hitchcock's
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
probably not going to do this free all
 
01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
the time for all the municipalities do
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
you see that then coming out of your
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
Department's budget the the the the
 
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
municipality as a whole budget or the
 
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
state would always be picking up the
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
bill or Insurance where do you see that
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
going I believe that the my personal
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
opinion is that moving forward the idea
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
of this screening program that we
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
currently have is to build a data set
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
okay that's what we did with our
 
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
firefighters we built a data set and we
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
showed okay that there are results from
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
this and it's worth taking the next step
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
with this data set we're going to show
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
those same results Statewide once having
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
that data set it is my belief that this
 
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
should be part of a firefighter's
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
personal health insurance for the record
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
I believe that this is a very important
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
bill and this is a first step
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay and in vital first step in order to
 
01:20:59.830 --> 01:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
build the data that we need in order to
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
provide the proper screenings moving
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
forward for every single firefighter in
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
the state but I do believe that should
 
01:21:07.709 --> 01:21:07.719 align:start position:0%
fall in their insurance I'll be
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest with this committee I
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
do not believe that our my firefighters
 
01:21:13.629 --> 01:21:13.639 align:start position:0%
should be going to a fire station along
 
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
with Dartmouth Hitchcock Personnel to
 
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
perform Dermatology screenings this is
 
01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:19.719 align:start position:0%
not the way healthc care should be done
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
the firefighters of the state deserve to
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
have these cancer screenings done by
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
their primary care physician
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
and the privacy of their own uh doctor
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
rooms that is that is my opinion I
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
believe that is the way it will be done
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
in the future I believe that this step
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
this bill as it is will show the
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
necessary data that we can then talk
 
01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
with the health insurance companies and
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
make those changes there I have had
 
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
talks with several health insurance
 
01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.790 align:start position:0%
talks with several health insurance
companies

01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
they understand the importance of this
 
01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
they understand that the cost of cancer
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
is very expensive and I can assure you
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
from what they've told me that this is
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
the better way to go based on the data
 
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
that we've proved that firefighters are
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to get cancer right I cannot sit
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
up here and promise you that they're not
 
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
going to it is going to happen Okay the
 
01:22:11.629 --> 01:22:11.639 align:start position:0%
fires that we are fighting are worse
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
today than they were 20 years ago okay
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
the chemicals in these fires are bad and
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
we are going to go in and we're going to
 
01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.510 align:start position:0%
we are going to go in and we're going to
save

01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
save
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
lives in order to do that you know as
 
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
safe as possible we have to have the
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
proper protective equipment the right
 
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
equipment I look at these cancer
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
screenings as one of those tools no
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
different than protective clothing no
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
different than a fire truck no different
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
than a fire hose thank you very much
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.830 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
representative

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
Lon so I have one question and a follow
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
up if I may Mr chair uh my first
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
question is um the statistics that you
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
gathered based on the screenings that
 
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
you did um did you submit those online
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
to us and do we have those or is that
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
something you could email to members of
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
the committee so that we have those
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
statistics because some of us didn't
 
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
write them down quite as quickly as we
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely I did not I'll be honest
 
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
with you um I don't spend that much time
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
up here I didn't know that was a thing
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for that um but yes I
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
will get them to whoever it is that I
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
need to get them to if you can simply
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
email them to the committee members or
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
maybe email them to the chairman so that
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
he can we that was really very helpful
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh and my second question because of
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
your discussion of the Dermatology
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
screening is um if I have a proposal to
 
01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
eliminate the skin screening that came
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
from the professional firefighters are
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
you for that or are you against that uh
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
I am in support of that so what we found
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
through these cancer screenings talking
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
at length with Dartmouth with Elliott um
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
with the health insurance companies is
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
that most firefighters almost every
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
firefighter is eligible for Dermatology
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
screening so I think it would be a
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
better use of money that the state is
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
appropriating to use it towards the
 
01:23:59.629 --> 01:23:59.639 align:start position:0%
other tests we can get these tests I
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
believe that it's an educational um uh
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
educational training that we can do with
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
our members to explain to them that you
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
need to be talking to your doctor you
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
need to be getting these tests I can
 
01:24:12.669 --> 01:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
assure you that since we've done these
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
tests I've had more conversations with
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
doctors they understand better when we
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
first initially started this it was
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
difficult um but as we start making the
 
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
case and we start showing the data um
 
01:24:26.669 --> 01:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
the the doctors are on board and I
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
believe that we can get these
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
Dermatology screenings through our
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
doctors where they should be okay thank
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
you very much that's very helpful
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative blon um thank you Mr
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here I
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
apologize that I wasn't here right at
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
your start I was just trying to make
 
01:24:43.229 --> 01:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
sure we can get this bill done today um
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
as far as the pro the program that
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
happened in Manchester was that the lung
 
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
screening and the Dermatology or was
 
01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
there anything else involved in that
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
screening program we did a lungs CT in a
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
Dermatology screening it was a decision
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
that we started with those two tests to
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
see how that would go uh some of that
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
had to do just strictly with Logistics
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh it is very large fire department
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of moving parts that we
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
had to do um this was multiple multiple
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
months to get this done and I couldn't
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
be prouder of the members of the fire
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
department that were contributed to help
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
out that's a followup followup U thank
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
you and as a followup do you think that
 
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
um extending that I guess you said the
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
Dermatology is not necessarily required
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
since that's already available um but
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
would extending the lung can lung lung
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
CT screening across the state be a
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
significant step forward because what
 
01:25:31.149 --> 01:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
we're hearing now is we want to set
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
Baseline data and we want to get this
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%
started but whatever we pass Now isn't
 
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
going to be the end all be all we're
 
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
just moving forward in the process with
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
lung screenings across the state be a
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
meaningful step forward for firefighter
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
safety in New
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes lung screenings would I
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
believe all the tests are are are vital
 
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
in order to build that sample set um you
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
know this is an important step to find
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
out what that data is you know um for
 
01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:00.280 align:start position:0%
example you know thyroid cancer is
 
01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
really picking up across the country
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay and having a specific test to do
 
01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
that which is an ultrasound test um as
 
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
I've been told is the best way to find
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
that cancer from medical professionals
 
01:26:14.109 --> 01:26:14.119 align:start position:0%
such as people from darmouth and Elliott
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know I I don't do ultrasounds
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest with you um right but uh
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
I I believe all these tasks will provide
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
the necessary data so that don't the
 
01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
goal is for those onetime programs to
 
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
build that data set come back look at
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
the data and see what happens you know I
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you exactly what this what
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
tests go forward you know after this um
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
maybe they all do maybe they don't I I
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
believe that's a decision that we can
 
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
make after once seeing the the full data
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
set of all these tests and if I have one
 
01:26:50.109 --> 01:26:50.119 align:start position:0%
more followup um and so you said
 
01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
Baseline data so any of these tests if
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
there was the blood blood screen for all
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
these different cancers you'd be looking
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
to have that be a baseline to compare
 
01:26:59.790 --> 01:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
the test today with the test in the
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
future is that correct when I one yes uh
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
also when I refer to a baseline the goal
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
would be to get firefighters screened
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
upon entry into the fire service so that
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
we have a full Baseline of what their
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
health condition is when they get on and
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
then you know for some of us 25 years
 
01:27:21.149 --> 01:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
later what it looks like then um cuz it
 
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
changes you know uh every firefighter I
 
01:27:27.149 --> 01:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
know that has retired has some sort of
 
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
me uh physical issue once they retire
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative Merchant thank
 
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair going through this I heard
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
before I think a testimony the
 
01:27:44.109 --> 01:27:44.119 align:start position:0%
importance of a CAT scan or even a pet
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
scan which is different than an
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
ultrasound diagnostic yes so are we
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
going down the road where we're not in
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
the bill anyways
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
identifying the appropriate test that
 
01:27:57.629 --> 01:27:57.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
done in the bill it has certain tests
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
that are outlined and and I support
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
those tests and that test the one that's
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
in there is a lung CT and I had that
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
test performed I'll be honest with you
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
it was the easiest medical test that I
 
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
have ever done it took approximately 4
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
minutes and uh from what I'm told it's
 
01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
not a super expensive test I'm not going
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
to talk about Elliott and dartmouth's
 
01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
crost but it it was probably the easiest
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
medical test I have ever had in my life
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
followup followup so again back to what
 
01:28:33.629 --> 01:28:33.639 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing then is that the CT scan is
 
01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
critical is the lung the rest of the
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
body is not so critical no I would say
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
it they're all critical because the
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
it on harder organs inside the body the
 
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
that will find cancer in those such as
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
thyroid so a lung CT for example will
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
not detect thyroid cancer and the reason
 
01:28:59.550 --> 01:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing this very expansive panel is
 
01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
that we are trying to find out
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
exactly how much cancer is out there in
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
the firefighters in the state of New
 
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we need a we need a larger
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
testing pool to figure that out there
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
are Cancers that are happening across
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
the country that do not happen at the
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
same rate in normal citizens they just
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
don't um the the data on female
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
firefighters which is not compiled to a
 
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
point yet is already very scary you know
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
female firefighters are Contracting
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
cancer at an even faster rate than male
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
firefighters thyroid cancer which I'll
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
be perfectly honest with you I hadn't
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
even heard of until a couple months ago
 
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
is apparently starting to become very
 
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
rampant there are a lot of cancers that
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
are not symptomatic to the normal
 
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:49.719 align:start position:0%
population that firefighters are getting
 
01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
and that I think it's important to have
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
the widest possible range of testing so
 
01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:55.719 align:start position:0%
that we as a state and the
 
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the entire State of
 
01:29:59.229 --> 01:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can look at that and then
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
say okay what is our best move now
 
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
moving forward that we've compiled this
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
data that we can make this as safe as we
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
can for the firefighters in this state
 
01:30:08.159 --> 01:30:09.229 align:start position:0%
can for the firefighters in this state
thank

01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
lonza thank you uh for taking my
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to ask you said
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
you'd get a baseline initially but would
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
you um wait 25 years years or should you
 
01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
do it sooner than that especially if you
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
have uh the exposure for past would you
 
01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
want to wait 25 years to have another
 
01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
test done no I understand your question
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
I apologize if I misspoke the goal would
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
be after this
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
initial Baseline test the goal would be
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
to get every firefighter screened upon
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
entry when they had hired to find out
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
what their Baseline is when they get
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
hired and then continually screen those
 
01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
firefighters throughout their career to
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're not getting
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
cancer okay thank you very much
 
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
representative McLean thank you Mr chair
 
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
just to clarify you're originally the
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
intention here is to cast as broad inet
 
01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
as possible because it's a funnel and
 
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
once you have had a chance to look at
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
all the data you may jettison stuff
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
basically and say this is this this is
 
01:31:19.709 --> 01:31:19.719 align:start position:0%
cost with no benefit so we're going to
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
gen but this is very effective and so we
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
may not be ending up with this at all
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
this is just the top of the
 
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
funnel that is absolutely very possible
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at the data and see
 
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
what it comes out of it at the end of
 
01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
the day as I stated earlier I do believe
 
01:31:37.109 --> 01:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
that this belongs within a person's
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
personal health insurance and that you
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
know we're got to have the data to back
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
that up so some of the tests could stay
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
some of them could go we could have
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
maybe there's other ones that the health
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
insurance company say you know what why
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
don't we do this one I I believe that's
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
why we want to cast this wide net and
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
then make that decision afterwards
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
you I think this is a duplication I I
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
have unless there's two Chris Wyman's
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
here I think uh good okay there's only
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
one Chris Wyman right okay no one else
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
has signed up to speak does anyone else
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
wish to testify on Senate Bill 352
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
FNA you see IGN Christina could you give
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
much um three people signed all in favor
 
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill on the blue sheet and
 
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
representative Lon is looking at uh who
 
01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.030 --> 01:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
um online were nine in support and two
 
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
OPP post thank you
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative okay um at this point
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to be going into executive
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
session on this bill I'm suspecting the
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
two parties will want to caucus on this
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
or representative Weber is yours I I
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to caucus
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
particularly let's take let's take five
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
minutes okay why don't we take a five
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
minute recess if we may and I will'll be
 
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
back okay we not needing to caucus I'd
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
love to have everybody just come over to

01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
okay would like to reconvene and go into
 
01:42:07.589 --> 01:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
executive session at this time on Senate
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 352 FNA representative Webby you
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
distribute yes I do thank you Mr
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
chairman um uh let's try this and then
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
when it gets to the end just pass any
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
extras over to the other side
 
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
I think there should be enough for any
 
01:42:30.189 --> 01:42:30.199 align:start position:0%
all it does just so you know is remove
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
the skin cancer screening
 
01:42:33.199 --> 01:42:38.390 align:start position:0%
the skin cancer screening
from

01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
line

01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
um from line seven of the bill uh It
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
just strikes out the skin cancer
 
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
screening because um I was told that
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
that is taken care of routinely under
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
exist ing health insurance
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
so that's the only thing I got are you
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
moving its adoption representative I
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
would be delighted to move its adoption
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would like to move the
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
adoption of amendment 2024 1461 H is
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
there a second second okay
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative McKay seconds and do you
 
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
want to speak to it further or you all
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
no I think that was enough thank you any
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
other discussion representative Lon um
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for bringing this
 
01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:25.719 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is actually for page
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
two lines 5 through 7 and it removes the
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
individual um it's uh paragraph 5 a okay
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
I'm very sorry I have completely
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
misrepresented everything so I'm glad
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
you took a really solid look at it I I
 
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
know you had said that there at this
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
point I will not if if my seconder will
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%

01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
I I will not offer this one oh okay it
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
it does doesn't do what I thought it did
 
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative MCC with second thank
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
you okay representative L also has an
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
amendment for our consideration yes I'd
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
like to move um amendment 20241 16498 to
 
01:44:16.990 --> 01:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
352 it's coming down it's coming around
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
caucusing yeah so um I I'm not sure if
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
there's a second on this one yet have
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
you made have you moved yes I moved in
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative paza are you
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
seconding okay representative paza
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
seconds thank you um so um I had
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
initially sent over to remove both a
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
blood test and ultrasound of vital
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
organs from lines 6 through 7 and then
 
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
also lines 8 through 13 from the bill um
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
I had tried to change that so that it
 
01:45:13.589 --> 01:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
didn't remove the blood test and
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
ultrasounded vital organs because I did
 
01:45:17.589 --> 01:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
find that there were some valid reasons
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
for it um I I remain concerned with this
 
01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
multi-cancer blood test test because um
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
it when it does become FDA approved it
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
will probably be a different test so it
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
won't serve as a baseline but um
 
01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
similarly I see that it removed the
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
blood test so that means you can't even
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
have the fecal ult blood test as part of
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
this program and that would be should be
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
at least a minimum standard within this
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
um so perhaps it's worth also
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
withdrawing this one and then just going
 
01:45:48.750 --> 01:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
for the bill itself because this isn't
 
01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
exactly what I asked for in the
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
amendment sorry I was handing it out as
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
I was going through this
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's what happens when we try and uh
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
hear an exec on the fly so sorry
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative representative Weber um
 
01:46:05.589 --> 01:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
so I too have been thinking about things
 
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
and having been directed to the correct
 
01:46:12.669 --> 01:46:12.679 align:start position:0%
part of the statute
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
um this does actually remove the limit
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
of 1300 and we were told that that would
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
be okay
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
um so I am going to offer this amendment
 
01:46:31.229 --> 01:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
if I may and I I will just
 
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
say that for me the whole point of
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
this is all the things we don't know and
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
as we learn more we do better but this
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
is the first step in learning more and
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
therefore doing better and I am so
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can pass the bill as as
 
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
it's with with the uh extra tests left
 
01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
in and send it on to finance because I
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
think in terms of health
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
policy and the learning that we will
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
get just as the Manchester
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
firefighters gathered information that
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
showed the risks to their members and
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
targeted individual members for
 
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
treatment this will also allow us to
 
01:47:33.709 --> 01:47:33.719 align:start position:0%
Target members for treatment early
 
01:47:37.629 --> 01:47:37.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm not a doctor but I sure know
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
from my own family that very early
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
detection makes treatment far more
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
effective um so um I guess I would
 
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
actually if I may renew my motion for
 
01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.310 align:start position:0%
actually if I may renew my motion for
1461

01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
1461
 
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
H and it it removes the $1300 limit per
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
person on line six and seven of page two
 
01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
representative McKay do you off you a
 
01:48:09.790 --> 01:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
second again yes representative Leon you
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
wish to speak um yes thank you Mr
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
01:48:15.629 --> 01:48:15.639 align:start position:0%
Weber um if you look at the fiscal note
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill it says that there
 
01:48:19.870 --> 01:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
3,626 individuals who would be
 
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
considered eligible under this bill at
 
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
the 5 million cost that we have that
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
$1,378 192 because we don't want to
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
round up so we don't spend all the money
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
um my concern would just be about the
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
equity if we were to remove that $1,300
 
01:48:37.629 --> 01:48:37.639 align:start position:0%
cap I suggest that uh just like some of
 
01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:39.719 align:start position:0%
the other discussions we move we we pass
 
01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
the bill unamended and just move our
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
discussion to finance so that we're not
 
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
acting hastily so I'll be voting against
 
01:48:46.669 --> 01:48:46.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment but I appreciate you
 
01:48:49.390 --> 01:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
bringing it you know I think that's fair
 
01:48:51.629 --> 01:48:51.639 align:start position:0%
enough actually and I will if if if
 
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:53.800 align:start position:0%
you're withdrawing amendment I will
 
01:48:56.669 --> 01:48:56.679 align:start position:0%
withdraw mine for the second time if all
 
01:48:59.709 --> 01:48:59.719 align:start position:0%
right if representative McKay will
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
indulge me in in in withdrawing his
 
01:49:04.109 --> 01:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
second we're we're going to get dizzy
 
01:49:07.229 --> 01:49:07.239 align:start position:0%
here pretty soon yeah I mean
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
this if I may Mr chairman this is the
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
issue with doing these very complicated
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
bills on the Fly and what this committee
 
01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
is really good at is taking a lot of
 
01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
complicated data and discussing it
 
01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
together and together we are way more
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
valuable than the sum of our parts so
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
this is a tough way to proceed but I I
 
01:49:34.109 --> 01:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
think if we could vote on the original
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
bill I think that that's the best way
 
01:49:38.189 --> 01:49:38.199 align:start position:0%
forward okay do I have a motion on the
 
01:49:38.199 --> 01:49:39.109 align:start position:0%
forward okay do I have a motion on the
original

01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
Bill representative Lon moves I'll move
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
on to
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
pass okay uh representative Missour

land do you wish to speak to your motion
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%

01:49:55.870 --> 01:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
any other discussion seeing none I'll
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%

forward on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
oncology and hematology which is a
 
01:52:37.149 --> 01:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
medical practice that specializes in
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
treating patients suffering from cancer
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation would allow New
 
01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oncology and hematology to
 
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
directly dispense a limited supply of
 
01:52:47.550 --> 01:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
non-controlled oral anti-cancer drugs to
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
patients under their care the practice
 
01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
took this issue to the Board of Pharmacy
 
01:52:53.229 --> 01:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
and they ruled that they needed
 
01:52:54.669 --> 01:52:54.679 align:start position:0%
legislative Clarity to allow the

Massachusetts Vermont and Maine allow

for the for direct dispensing of
 
01:53:04.589 --> 01:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
anti-cancer drugs from providers this is
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that does not place
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
any new mandates on insurers providers
 
01:53:10.830 --> 01:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
or patients insurance companies can
 
01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
still require covered members to use
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
preferred pharmacies and prior
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
authorization direct dispensing of oral
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%

around the country and has many benefits
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
for patients including better care

01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 458 legislation that was
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
requested by our
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
organization in order to explain the
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind why we asked Senator
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
avard to file this bill I'd like to step
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
back and provide some
 
01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
background in April 2023 our New
 
01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oncology requested a
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
declaratory reading ruling from the New
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Pharmacy on whether
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
Physicians could dispense non-controlled
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs in order to meet
 
01:56:02.069 --> 01:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
patients immediate medical needs without
 
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
limitation on day supply except for what
 
01:56:07.390 --> 01:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
was clinically appropriate ultimately
 
01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
the board ruled that the request for
 
01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
ruling was outside the board's
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and that they did not have
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
the authority to do so which was up to
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature to Grant therefore we're
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
here today to ask for your support for
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
the concept of this legislation
 
01:56:24.589 --> 01:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
over the past decade alternative
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
anti-cancer medications or analytics
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
have been brought to the market
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
replacing traditional intravenous
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
therapies the medications do not need to
 
01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
be mixed or compounded and are almost
 
01:56:40.069 --> 01:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
exclusively pills or tablets the
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
prescription the prescriptions free the
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
patients from having to physically be in
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
the clinic for treatment and instead
 
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
allows them to manage their Cancer
 
01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
Treatments at home with proper
 
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring by their providers we have we
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
have found through our practice that
 
01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
there are a number of clinical and
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
convenience-based challenges with the
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
Specialty Pharmacy dispensing process
 
01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:01.159 align:start position:0%
currently patients must coordinate
 
01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
deliveries which at times can be delayed
 
01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
affecting a patient's clinical outcome
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
also complicating the process uh excuse
 
01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
me is altering the doses of medications
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
for treatment when this occurs the
 
01:57:15.709 --> 01:57:15.719 align:start position:0%
adjustments necess necessitate a new
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
prescription which can start the whole
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
approval process again there are a few
 
01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
things I ask the committee to keep in
 
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
mind when considering the legislation
 
01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown that enabling
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
licensed cancer Health Care
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
Professionals to dispense a longer-term
 
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
supply of non-controlled oral
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
anti-cancer drugs above and beyond what
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
is currently authorized will optimize a
 
01:57:36.910 --> 01:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
patient's adherence to their treatments
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
increase doctor's ability to personalize
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
Cancer Treatments to best address
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
patient needs and streamline the order
 
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
process for drugs needed for treatment
 
01:57:48.189 --> 01:57:48.199 align:start position:0%
research has showed that patients serve
 
01:57:50.270 --> 01:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
through direct dispensing model have a
 
01:57:52.990 --> 01:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
95% medical adherence rate versus 70%
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
when prescriptions are dispensed in
 
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
other instances this ultimately leads to
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
better outcomes our facility has a
 
01:58:02.189 --> 01:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
licensed pharmacist on staff who that
 
01:58:04.589 --> 01:58:04.599 align:start position:0%
will uh work in consultation with a full
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
Medical Care team to dispense the
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
medications um our patients are
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
carefully and nearly continuously
 
01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
monitored not only to develop a better
 
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of their individualized
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
needs and unique experiences but to
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
ensure their safety if there are any
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
issues or changes in their status we
 
01:58:23.550 --> 01:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
have the ability to quickly change the
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
course of treatment including the doses
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
of their prescriptions there have been
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
numerous studies that have showed that
 
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
in that medically integrated dispensing
 
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
reduces the cost to patients into the
 
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
Healthcare System
 
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
overall I also want to make the
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
committee aware that we have continued
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
to engage in dialogue with various
 
01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders regarding Amendment
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
language that seeks to clarify the
 
01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
legislation after hearing concerns from
 
01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
the in the initial public hearing we're
 
01:58:50.069 --> 01:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
committed to continuing those
 
01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
discussions over the course of the next
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
few weeks to make a stronger piece of
 
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
legislation I'd like to thank you for
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak before you
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
today and we'll be happy to take any
 
01:58:59.669 --> 01:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Doctor any questions
 
01:58:59.679 --> 01:59:02.030 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Doctor any questions
representa

01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
representa
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and pardon my
 
01:59:08.430 --> 01:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
ignorance but I'm I'm not in the medical
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
field so what I want to understand is
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
the current state the limitations on the
 
01:59:17.310 --> 01:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
current state and why they exist so is
 
01:59:19.950 --> 01:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
it that you can't distribute things that
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
require mixing is that the limit ation
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
is on the quantity that you can dispense
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
so what are those current limitations
 
01:59:30.669 --> 01:59:30.679 align:start position:0%
and to the best of your knowledge can
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
you maybe talk to why they exist and why
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
you think that this is okay thank
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
you I'm happy to thank you for the
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
question so there there are really two
 
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
main types of cancer treatments that are
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
given or two main categories one are
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
intravenous treatments infusions and the
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
other are these oral
 
01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:52.679 align:start position:0%
medicines we give the intravenous
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
treatments to our patients in our
 
01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
infusion center we've done this for many
 
01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:57.430 align:start position:0%
infusion center we've done this for many
many

01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
many
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
years um with following the national
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines for or national regulations
 
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
for our Pharmacy for safety for there
 
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
are many many
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
um Quality programs that our National
 
02:00:15.390 --> 02:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
Society ASCO um and others um have
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
developed that we follow as well so
 
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
we've been doing this for many many
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
years mixing those medicines and giving
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
them to patients in the office oral
 
02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
medications are the ones that we're
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
concerned with here which have been have
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
developed over time and have in either
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
um supplemented or replace some of those
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
intravenous medicines so for those
 
02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
prescriptions now I will I will make um
 
02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
create a treatment plan I will will work
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
out the doses for a med for a
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
prescription we have to go through a
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization process and those
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
prescriptions now go to Specialty
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
pharmacies almost exclusively out of
 
02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.470 align:start position:0%
pharmacies almost exclusively out of
state

02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
um those um prescriptions then get sent
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
back to the patient at their house and
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
they are and um they take them with our
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
supervision so we have our pharmacist um
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
our nurses working together with the
 
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
patients to make sure they're getting
 
02:01:08.069 --> 02:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
the right dose and that they're taking
 
02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
it in a safe way what we cannot do or
 
02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
what is not clear that we can do uh
 
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
through the regulations of the Board of
 
02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy is distribute some of those
 
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
medicines ourselves to the patients and
 
02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:23.679 align:start position:0%
the among the many reasons that that is
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
is important often these medicines get
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
adjusted the doses get adjusted I'll see
 
02:01:30.189 --> 02:01:30.199 align:start position:0%
a patient after a couple weeks of
 
02:01:32.109 --> 02:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
treatment find that they have side
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
effects maybe their blood counts are low
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
will want to reduce the dose and if the
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
prescriptions are being sent to them
 
02:01:41.550 --> 02:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
from a from a um from a mailaway
 
02:01:44.350 --> 02:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
pharmacy a specialty pharmacy it's very
 
02:01:46.589 --> 02:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
hard to get those changes Incorporated
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
in time to start their next cycle of
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
treatment which might be a couple days
 
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
after I see them so we have to sort of
 
02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
work to um either delay the treatment
 
02:01:58.270 --> 02:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
and get the right prescription in or
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
sort of Jerry rig their prescription a
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
little bit so they get the right amount
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
whereas if we were able to give the
 
02:02:06.189 --> 02:02:06.199 align:start position:0%
prescriptions directly to the patients
 
02:02:08.109 --> 02:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
through our Pharmacy and the office we
 
02:02:09.709 --> 02:02:09.719 align:start position:0%
could do that and get them on the right
 
02:02:11.709 --> 02:02:11.719 align:start position:0%
dose right at the right time but right
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
now there it's not clear with the
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
regulations in the pharmacy regulations
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
are the it's broader than that in the
 
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that we can give
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
those prescriptions to patients
 
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
follow up so I understand you know you
 
02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
want to be able to make adjustments in
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
more real time that makes sense to me I
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
understand that but what is what what's
 
02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
your original thinking why why can't you
 
02:02:37.229 --> 02:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
do that why was it put in place
 
02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
initially that that was something that
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
you couldn't do was there a reason or
 
02:02:43.229 --> 02:02:43.239 align:start position:0%
was that was just just organically it
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
happened that way but there there must
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
be a reason why currently you can't do
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
it well and I I don't want to get
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
outside inside my Lane as they say but
 
02:02:55.629 --> 02:02:55.639 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the reason is that it
 
02:02:57.310 --> 02:02:57.320 align:start position:0%
was not anticipated that this was going
 
02:02:59.470 --> 02:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
to happen so the the
 
02:03:01.950 --> 02:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
regulations the the regulations that are
 
02:03:05.470 --> 02:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
in place didn't anticipate this class of
 
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
drugs being developed and the somewhat
 
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
unique circumstances that in oncology
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
that that have evolved over time so the
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
and and it isn't so much that that again
 
02:03:19.629 --> 02:03:19.639 align:start position:0%
that that it is clear that we cannot do
 
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
it it's just that it isn't clear that we
 
02:03:25.069 --> 02:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
can do it and um when we asked the Board
 
02:03:27.669 --> 02:03:27.679 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy to clarify that they felt
 
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
like they couldn't do it they they
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't give us that Clarity and it's
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
this is very relevant because it's
 
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
because of the safety um
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
requirements of how this Pharmacy would
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
be run in our office it's it is a very
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
significant um outlay of of resources in
 
02:03:49.149 --> 02:03:49.159 align:start position:0%
order to to put that in place so we need
 
02:03:51.310 --> 02:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
Clarity to know that we can do that and
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be following the
 
02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
regulations of the State of New
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that that won't be you
 
02:03:58.270 --> 02:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
know two years from now it won't be sort
 
02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
of someone someone might have a
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
different interpretation and I would
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
note that um as was as was um was the
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
point that was made when when the bill
 
02:04:12.669 --> 02:04:12.679 align:start position:0%
during the introduction this is a very
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
common practice not only um are is it
 
02:04:17.069 --> 02:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
allowed in the state of Maine and the
 
02:04:18.669 --> 02:04:18.679 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont in the state of
 
02:04:21.069 --> 02:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New York but I'd also
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
say that that the that needing to go and
 
02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
create an exemption like we have have
 
02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
discussed here is is also something that
 
02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
was needed in many of those States
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that it was not that
 
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
it was not obvious when the or when that
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
how these things would evolve over time
 
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
so there are there are very analogous
 
02:04:43.149 --> 02:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
exemptions that were were created in
 
02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
those other states because of this this
 
02:04:45.719 --> 02:04:47.229 align:start position:0%
those other states because of this this
same

02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:04:50.030 --> 02:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
process representative
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you
 
02:04:54.549 --> 02:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
what I think I'm not understanding is
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about establishing a
 
02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacy within your
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
practice and do is the issue that that
 
02:05:05.549 --> 02:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
is not staffed by a pharmacist and that
 
02:05:07.709 --> 02:05:07.719 align:start position:0%
it's other people who are doing the
 
02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
dispensing that are not registered
 
02:05:14.109 --> 02:05:14.119 align:start position:0%
pharmacists that you need this well the
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
the the issue with again I don't want to
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
overstep my um knowledge and
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
understanding but I think the issue is
 
02:05:23.950 --> 02:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
that the regulation says that a
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
physician office can dispense up to a
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
certain amount of medicine for an
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
immediate need but it is not clear what
 
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
that is and and whether we what the
 
02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
limits are and I would just make a
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
little note that we have a pharmacy in
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
our office so we have a pharmacy that
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
that prepares and um helps the
 
02:05:47.390 --> 02:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
administration of of the infusional
 
02:05:49.709 --> 02:05:49.719 align:start position:0%
treatments that are given which frankly
 
02:05:51.149 --> 02:05:51.159 align:start position:0%
are much more complicated than what
 
02:05:52.589 --> 02:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about with this because
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
they need to be mixed and and you know
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
there's there's a whole another layer of
 
02:05:58.510 --> 02:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
complexity to it we have that we've been
 
02:06:03.470 --> 02:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
doing that um um sort of in um
 
02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
accordance with the with the the
 
02:06:08.669 --> 02:06:08.679 align:start position:0%
regulations of the Board of Pharmacy for
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
decades but what we don't have is the is
 
02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
the um the the um clear approval that we
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
could do this with the with the uh oral
 
02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
medications so representative Leon and
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
then representative Shapiro um thank you
 
02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you so much doctor
 
02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
for being here and taking time out of
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
your busy day taking care of patients um
 
02:06:36.510 --> 02:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
so as I'm understanding this you are
 
02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
able to do all of this with these IV
 
02:06:41.709 --> 02:06:41.719 align:start position:0%
cancer drugs um people in other states
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
and questionably you if we were to give
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
it clear would be able to do it with the
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
cancer pills too and you have a
 
02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
pharmacist who's part of this but um is
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
if um so the idea of not getting just
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
going through and doing a regular
 
02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
pharmacy license is is that a lot
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
because in your office you have a
 
02:07:01.709 --> 02:07:01.719 align:start position:0%
pharmacist but there may be a day or two
 
02:07:03.709 --> 02:07:03.719 align:start position:0%
that they're not there and so being able
 
02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
to immediately dispense this and give
 
02:07:08.350 --> 02:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
these cancer pills to a do a patient
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
that you could give a cancer IV to um
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
being able to do this without needing to
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
have a pharmacy with a pharmacist always
 
02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
on staff because you have a pharmacist
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
who is but isn't always present is that
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
why it's so important to make sure that
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
oncology practices are protected in our
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
law and in our rules for how you can
 
02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
dispense these medications and just
 
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
continue providing the same care you've
 
02:07:32.549 --> 02:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
been providing all along yes exactly
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's the point you make is is is one
 
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
of the critical issues for us that that
 
02:07:40.709 --> 02:07:40.719 align:start position:0%
um we're not a hospital and and the so
 
02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
there are several different classes of
 
02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
of licenses that are available you know
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
for pharmacies one is an Institutional
 
02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
license which which covers hospitals
 
02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
like conquered hospital or Dartmouth
 
02:07:55.229 --> 02:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock or whichever though they the
 
02:07:56.589 --> 02:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
they are much more complicated
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
organizations than our independent
 
02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
practice so the they there's many
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
different layers of regulations for them
 
02:08:05.870 --> 02:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
there's many different types of
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for them which is very
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
different than what we get which is part
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
of why it's more costeffective to do
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
this through offices like ours as an
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
aside but because of that we don't have
 
02:08:19.709 --> 02:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
um four pharmacists on employed we have
 
02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
one pharmacist that's employed by our
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
practice for uh you know that
 
02:08:27.549 --> 02:08:27.559 align:start position:0%
oversees um our treatments that we give
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
intravenously and also watches also
 
02:08:32.109 --> 02:08:32.119 align:start position:0%
oversees these treatments that we're
 
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
giving now through these other
 
02:08:36.990 --> 02:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacies um if she's on vacation like
 
02:08:38.549 --> 02:08:38.559 align:start position:0%
she is this week for school vacation
 
02:08:41.549 --> 02:08:41.559 align:start position:0%
week then all of a sudden our treatments
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
would grind to as to a halt so we that's
 
02:08:46.709 --> 02:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
why we need a little more flexibility I
 
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
would say than than some of the other
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
than those than those other class so
 
02:08:53.709 --> 02:08:53.719 align:start position:0%
there's the institutional and then
 
02:08:55.069 --> 02:08:55.079 align:start position:0%
there's as I understand it there's the
 
02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
commercial retail license and we we
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
don't really meet either of those so
 
02:09:00.589 --> 02:09:00.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's always been part of the
 
02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Board of Pharmacy
 
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
followup followup um so as a followup in
 
02:09:07.549 --> 02:09:07.559 align:start position:0%
order to protect independent oncology
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
practice and the ability to do that in
 
02:09:11.149 --> 02:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now that we're moving from
 
02:09:14.790 --> 02:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
IV drugs to these to the oral drugs does
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
that mean that in order to make sure
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
that we can still have independent
 
02:09:19.149 --> 02:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
oncologists we need to make sure there's
 
02:09:20.589 --> 02:09:20.599 align:start position:0%
a way for you to do this without
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
building out a huge Pharmacy within your
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
practice or having to completely
 
02:09:28.709 --> 02:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
Outsource it yes thank you
 
02:09:28.719 --> 02:09:29.830 align:start position:0%
Outsource it yes thank you
representative

02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
chero thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
for taking this question what what
 
02:09:39.709 --> 02:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
implications if any would there be for
 
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
um Financial reimbursement for these
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
medications if you changed the way you
 
02:09:47.189 --> 02:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
did this or for the patient's
 
02:09:49.549 --> 02:09:49.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility for you financial
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility for these medications
 
02:09:55.549 --> 02:09:55.559 align:start position:0%
would there be any changes for the
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
patient the short answer is no um the
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
the um the there there would not be more
 
02:10:05.149 --> 02:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the part of the
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
patients in the in the with these uh if
 
02:10:11.549 --> 02:10:11.559 align:start position:0%
we were to do this this way it gets a
 
02:10:13.069 --> 02:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
little bit complicated when you're
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
talking about all the other layers of of
 
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
um you know the um of insurance and and
 
02:10:21.629 --> 02:10:21.639 align:start position:0%
how everything passes through through
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
but but I would say more broadly that
 
02:10:29.470 --> 02:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
practices like ours because they because
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
we're not hospitals because we don't
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
have the other layers of regulations we
 
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
are reimbursed at a lower rate than than
 
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
um the same care would be in a given in
 
02:10:43.390 --> 02:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
a different setting and uh because of
 
02:10:45.709 --> 02:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
that that's that is why generally
 
02:10:48.510 --> 02:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
speaking when when treatments are given
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
through a practice like ours that's
 
02:10:52.270 --> 02:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
given at a it's at a much lower cost
 
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
setting um representative Merchant then
 
02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:00.709 align:start position:0%
setting um representative Merchant then
representative

02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
not I'll defer to
 
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman um
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
So currently you're allowed to give a
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
30-day prescription but not 60 no well
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
or you're not allowed at all right now
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to do it's we're not
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to do it at all or it's not
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
clear that we can do it at all okay
 
02:11:23.229 --> 02:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
02:11:25.229 --> 02:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Dr Crow for being
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
here taking my question in regards to
 
02:11:31.709 --> 02:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
dispensing versus administration of
 
02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
drugs if I understand and follow the
 
02:11:36.669 --> 02:11:36.679 align:start position:0%
logic here currently when something's
 
02:11:38.109 --> 02:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
administered to the patient in the
 
02:11:39.870 --> 02:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
office how is that build out on the
 
02:11:42.750 --> 02:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
medical side or the pharmacy benefit
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
side so again I don't want to overstep
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
my uh my understanding of these things
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
the uh and despite the fact that we run
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
an independent practice and I'm oversee
 
02:11:56.709 --> 02:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
all all of that I I my my knowledge of
 
02:12:00.510 --> 02:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
the detail of of those of the billing
 
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
process is is not what it should be um
 
02:12:07.390 --> 02:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
the uh I I probably shouldn't say
 
02:12:08.669 --> 02:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
anything because I don't want to I don't
 
02:12:10.750 --> 02:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
want to say something that's that's
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's ill-informed and and might be
 
02:12:14.830 --> 02:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
misleading because I think it's what I'm
 
02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is that when you get to
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
the dispensing toally 30 60 days of
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
dispensing that's normally done on the
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacy benefit side so I'm going to be
 
02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
sure that if this is going forward that
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
the facility has the ability to use the
 
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
patients Pharmacy benefit that they are
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
using and not have them tied up into a
 
02:12:36.430 --> 02:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
quandry between is it the medical side
 
02:12:37.950 --> 02:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
or is the pharmacy side because it's
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
pretty clear when it comes to the
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
dispensing that goes through the
 
02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacy benefit side so are we talking
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
about the pharmacy benefit side that's
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get
 
02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
to and again I I can't answer your
 
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:54.589 --> 02:12:54.599 align:start position:0%
that that should be an easy answer for
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
us to get for you I just I just don't
 
02:12:57.950 --> 02:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
want to give you the wrong one thank you
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
would follow please follow up and also I
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
understand that the New England um
 
02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
oncology group has a pharmacy license
 
02:13:09.870 --> 02:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
today so we actually have um a member
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
from the the the New England cancer
 
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
specialist here with us today who who I
 
02:13:16.109 --> 02:13:16.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for them but I know
 
02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
support this bill they have a license
 
02:13:21.870 --> 02:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
with their practice in Portsmith I I
 
02:13:24.510 --> 02:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
believe from my conversations with them
 
02:13:27.709 --> 02:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
that that came about from the the
 
02:13:30.430 --> 02:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
license was um predated their
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
involvement in that office and I think
 
02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's through the the hospital there
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
through HCA rather than being for their
 
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
practice you may know better than me no
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
it I'll let them speak to it thank you
 
02:13:44.719 --> 02:13:46.629 align:start position:0%
it I'll let them speak to it thank you

02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
director um although we believe this
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
bill is well intentioned we are here in
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill today uh our
 
02:14:34.109 --> 02:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
Focus though is primarily on the length
 
02:14:38.350 --> 02:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
of time or the length of um the
 
02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
prescription um our understanding and
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
our experience is that uh cancer
 
02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
patients um sometimes have a difficult
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
time tolerating the um the oral
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
anti-cancer uh medication uh we're
 
02:14:56.669 --> 02:14:56.679 align:start position:0%
concerned that the dispensing of up to a
 
02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
60-day supply could lead to waste and
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
therefore extra costs and in some cases
 
02:15:06.510 --> 02:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
drug shortages which I understand is um
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
an issue that uh is creeping up at this
 
02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
point in time uh so our suggestion would
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
be to move the 60 days down to 30 days
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and at that point we could um
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
withdraw our opposition to the bill and
 
02:15:21.629 --> 02:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
with that I'll pass it to Peg if she has
 
02:15:24.189 --> 02:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
anything else to add yeah I just say
 
02:15:26.189 --> 02:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
that typically Medicaid allows for a
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
30-day supply of medications we do have
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
exceptions for uh maintenance
 
02:15:34.549 --> 02:15:34.559 align:start position:0%
medications which are typically for
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
chronic conditions once the patient is
 
02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
stable on a dose and we consider that
 
02:15:42.589 --> 02:15:42.599 align:start position:0%
120 days then we would allow up to a
 
02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
90-day Supply but that doesn't really
 
02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
drugs thank you
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to take questions sure
 
02:15:54.910 --> 02:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
okay any
 
02:15:57.870 --> 02:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative merant
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
follow up on the question I had to Dr
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
crow in regards to Medicaid how would
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
the billing occur is it going to go
 
02:16:05.870 --> 02:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
through on the pharmacy side on the
 
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
medical side how would that how would
 
02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid handle that uh it would depend
 
02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
how the claim came through whether they
 
02:16:14.350 --> 02:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
build it on a medical or a pharmacy
 
02:16:16.189 --> 02:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
claim we would we would pay it either
 
02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
way the uh reimbursement would be the
 
02:16:24.549 --> 02:16:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
cost followup so in order to accomplish
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
that there have to be some sort of
 
02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
software within the practice in order to
 
02:16:34.990 --> 02:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
accommodate the billing I mean because
 
02:16:36.150 --> 02:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get to is on the
 
02:16:37.669 --> 02:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
pharmacy side it's NDC numbers they
 
02:16:39.870 --> 02:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
almost J codes I'm getting some of
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
detail here but I'm trying to be sure
 
02:16:42.750 --> 02:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
that the patient doesn't get caught in
 
02:16:44.349 --> 02:16:44.359 align:start position:0%
the middle between the medical side and
 
02:16:46.389 --> 02:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy side and they don't
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
understand it yeah I believe we do still
 
02:16:53.230 --> 02:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
accept paper claims so somebody could
 
02:16:56.669 --> 02:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
submit a a paper Pharmacy claim but it
 
02:16:58.230 --> 02:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
probably would be easier for the
 
02:17:00.030 --> 02:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
practice if they don't have pharmacy
 
02:17:01.870 --> 02:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
software to and I don't know whether
 
02:17:05.349 --> 02:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
they do or don't um but you know a
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
medical claim could come through under a
 
02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous code and then um the NDC
 
02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
included on the claim and the quantity
 
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
dispensed and we would price it that
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
way representative Shapero thank you Mr
 
02:17:21.309 --> 02:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
chairman are your concerns about the
 
02:17:23.549 --> 02:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
number of days
 
02:17:28.429 --> 02:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
um more about waste and cost or are they
 
02:17:30.190 --> 02:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
also about
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
safety it it's more about what Medicaid
 
02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
pays for so like I said we typically pay
 
02:17:38.190 --> 02:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
for 30-day Supply and if we're being
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
asked to pay for a 60-day supply it's
 
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's not they're they're not routine
 
02:17:47.070 --> 02:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance medications and if there is
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
dose changes and dose adjustment then it
 
02:17:52.830 --> 02:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
does lead to um to waste which is a
 
02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
concern for us as well followup so it's
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
really about following the standards
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
that are already in place for Medicaid
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
yeah and and for what we allow for a
 
02:18:06.509 --> 02:18:06.519 align:start position:0%
claim to come through as thank you
 
02:18:06.519 --> 02:18:07.709 align:start position:0%
claim to come through as thank you
representative

02:18:07.709 --> 02:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:18:10.589 --> 02:18:10.599 align:start position:0%
n would you believe I have a family
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
member in a clinical trial that takes
 
02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
oral um cancer medication who has since
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
moved out of state and lives about 7
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
hours away from here and she's able to
 
02:18:27.389 --> 02:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
come every 3 months for her checkups and
 
02:18:30.629 --> 02:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
gets her pile of medicine so I'm just
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
thinking on the side of the patients
 
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
that um the 60-day supply could save
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
them another trip and it's not anyway
 
02:18:42.669 --> 02:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
would you
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
believe other question yes we
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
believe say no other questions okay
 
02:18:55.629 --> 02:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Steven well
 
02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
from New England Cancer
 
02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
sir morning everyone thank you for the
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today so my name is
 
02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:14.599 align:start position:0%
Steven rol I'm the director of Pharmacy
 
02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
operations for New England Cancer
 
02:19:20.349 --> 02:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
Specialists uh we have three practices
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
in Maine and one in Portsmith New
 
02:19:27.429 --> 02:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire within our practices in Maine
 
02:19:29.790 --> 02:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
um we operate a medically integrated
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
dispensing Pharmacy out of our scarbo
 
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
location where we fill oral anti-cancer
 
02:19:39.309 --> 02:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
medications for the residents of Maine
 
02:19:42.349 --> 02:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh we do not currently fill oral
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
anti-cancer medications for the patients
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um but to clarify we do
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
have an instate pharmacy license
 
02:19:54.389 --> 02:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
um at our Portsmith location uh but we
 
02:19:56.349 --> 02:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
are only administering injectable
 
02:19:58.750 --> 02:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
medications at that site uh at the
 
02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:00.190 align:start position:0%
medications at that site uh at the
present

02:20:00.190 --> 02:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
time so I just wanted to share my
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts um regarding medically
 
02:20:07.389 --> 02:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
integrated dispensing pharmacies and the
 
02:20:10.590 --> 02:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
benefits that it has to patients and as
 
02:20:13.230 --> 02:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
a quick background prior to joining New
 
02:20:15.389 --> 02:20:15.399 align:start position:0%
England Cancer Specialists um I was a
 
02:20:16.990 --> 02:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
health system based pharmacist in the
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
state of Maine for 12 years um at that
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
time and to be totally honest um my
 
02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
viewpoint was very limited and blinded
 
02:20:29.950 --> 02:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
to the way that traditional Pharmacy
 
02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
Works uh when I joined New England
 
02:20:35.469 --> 02:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
Cancer Specialists um it quickly
 
02:20:38.590 --> 02:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
recognized the benefits for which a
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
medically integrated dispensing Pharmacy
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
or in-office physician dispensing
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
provides to our patients to the points
 
02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
that Dr Crow
 
02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned um we are able to get get
 
02:20:54.429 --> 02:20:54.439 align:start position:0%
medications in the hands of our patients
 
02:20:57.070 --> 02:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
exceptionally faster than what a
 
02:21:00.190 --> 02:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
specialty pharmacy would be able to do
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh we are oftentimes able to get a
 
02:21:04.429 --> 02:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
medication in a patient's hands within
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
24 hours of that medication being
 
02:21:09.550 --> 02:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
prescribed where these larger male order
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
specialty pharmacies were often waiting
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
upwards of 7 to 14 days for these
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
medications um to arrive in a patient's
 
02:21:20.190 --> 02:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
hands so as you can imagine from timely
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
access to starting therapy that is
 
02:21:26.590 --> 02:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
critical uh for our patients and then
 
02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
furthermore from a multidisiplinary
 
02:21:32.590 --> 02:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint having Physicians nurses
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacists all within an in-office
 
02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
setting managing the care of these
 
02:21:39.870 --> 02:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
patients with their oral anti-cancer
 
02:21:42.590 --> 02:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
medications um drastically elevates the
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
level of care that we're providing um
 
02:21:47.550 --> 02:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
when you are working with a mail order
 
02:21:50.910 --> 02:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
Specialty Pharmacy um you are not
 
02:21:53.750 --> 02:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
getting uh intimate you know Hands-On
 
02:21:57.309 --> 02:21:57.319 align:start position:0%
care um that you would receive um at a
 
02:21:59.710 --> 02:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
oncology practice that is allowed to
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
dispense oral anti-cancer medications so
 
02:22:04.270 --> 02:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
between the pharmacists the nurses and
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
the providers um we are able to counsel
 
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
our patients especially as um
 
02:22:13.950 --> 02:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
adjustments and doses are made um if
 
02:22:15.630 --> 02:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
patients experiencing any side effects
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
or toxicities were able to quickly
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
manage it at that point as well um I
 
02:22:22.830 --> 02:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
could keep going on regarding this but
 
02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
one thing I did want to clarify
 
02:22:28.030 --> 02:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
regarding um the medical versus
 
02:22:31.150 --> 02:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
prescription benefit if that's okay um
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
so the oral anti-cancer medications
 
02:22:36.270 --> 02:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
would be build through the prescription
 
02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
benefit for the patient's Insurance
 
02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
versus the injectable medications are
 
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
going through the patients medical
 
02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
benefit so for Medicare as an example
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
Medicare Part B would be your injectable
 
02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
side Medicare Part D would your oral
 
02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:52.990 align:start position:0%
side Medicare Part D would your oral
anti-cancer

02:22:52.990 --> 02:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
anti-cancer
 
02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
medications questions representative
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
Weber and then representative
 
02:23:00.030 --> 02:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you and thank you for that
 
02:23:03.309 --> 02:23:03.319 align:start position:0%
last explanation which helps a lot
 
02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
um uh my question is with
 
02:23:11.469 --> 02:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
the the one raised by the department
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
about the concern about the
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
duration and um I understand Dr Crow's
 
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
point about and and yours as well about
 
02:23:23.230 --> 02:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes you find out within a week
 
02:23:25.469 --> 02:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
that somebody is not reacting well and
 
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
needs something else you don't want to
 
02:23:29.469 --> 02:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
waste a 60-day
 
02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
supply uh so this seems more sensible on
 
02:23:39.269 --> 02:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
that end the concern about the the
 
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
dispensing for a longer period of
 
02:23:46.510 --> 02:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
time am I not correct in thinking I mean
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
from my own experience that
 
02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
either insurance or Medicare or Medicaid
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
whoever is doing the paying is a
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
separate question and that is an issue
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
of what the covering entity will will
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
cover and the the amount that they will
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
cover um and that varies very much yes
 
02:24:12.670 --> 02:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
by that
 
02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
entity but it doesn't have a great deal
 
02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:16.990 align:start position:0%
entity but it doesn't have a great deal
to

02:24:16.990 --> 02:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:24:21.150 --> 02:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
do with the efficiency
 
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
so what I'm asking is do you see any
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
risks to leaving the time frame longer
 
02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
or do you see any benefits to leaving
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
the time frame longer I see the benefits
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
for a short time but not I want your
 
02:24:38.830 --> 02:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the longer time frame yeah
 
02:24:41.150 --> 02:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
in my opinion I have no concerns with
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
allowing a 60-day or even 90day supply
 
02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
of these medications so And to
 
02:24:49.230 --> 02:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
clarify um to your point the
 
02:24:51.790 --> 02:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
prescription benefit for the patient so
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
through their insurance is oftentimes
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
going to dictate whether you're even
 
02:24:57.950 --> 02:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to dispense more than a 30-day
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
Supply and for several of these uh oral
 
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
anti-cancer medications you are not
 
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to dispense more than 30 day at
 
02:25:08.030 --> 02:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
a time uh there's a number of
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
medications I could list uh where we're
 
02:25:13.630 --> 02:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
not allowed to do that that being said
 
02:25:17.230 --> 02:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
if you have a patient who is stable on
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
therapy um coming into the practice May
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
maybe every 3 months for their checkups
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
um dispensing a 3mon supply of that
 
02:25:28.590 --> 02:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
medication again if they are clinically
 
02:25:31.230 --> 02:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
stable tolerating their medications
 
02:25:33.469 --> 02:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
there is benefit to that prevents the
 
02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
patient from having to come back into
 
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
the practice or to receive their
 
02:25:38.670 --> 02:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
medication from on a monthly basis from
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
a specialty pharmacy so I do think there
 
02:25:44.910 --> 02:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
are benefits of having that as an option
 
02:25:46.590 --> 02:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
but again I think from a clinical
 
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
perspective no one's going to do that
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
unless the patient is stable and
 
02:25:52.349 --> 02:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
tolerating their
 
02:25:52.359 --> 02:25:53.950 align:start position:0%
tolerating their
medication

02:25:53.950 --> 02:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
medication
 
02:25:56.110 --> 02:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
followup just because you mentioned the
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
90day supply um are you comfortable with
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's written at 60 days
 
02:26:04.510 --> 02:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
because the bill is written at 60 days
 
02:26:07.230 --> 02:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I don't want to speak for
 
02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
um just for
 
02:26:11.230 --> 02:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
yourself yes I'm comfortable with 60
 
02:26:13.349 --> 02:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
days yes I mean would I also be
 
02:26:15.950 --> 02:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable with 90 days yes I would but
 
02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
I think again most clinicians when
 
02:26:20.429 --> 02:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
they're prescribing these medications
 
02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
are not going to jump out at a 90-day
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
supply of the medication you need to
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
make sure your patient is clinically
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
stable on the therapy before you Branch
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
out thank you very much representative
 
02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
Shapero and then representative Lon
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and this is a
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up question on the last question
 
02:26:41.790 --> 02:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
so just to be so I can be more clear if
 
02:26:45.630 --> 02:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
this bill passed with the language of 60
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
days um and you were providing
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
medication in office for some who had
 
02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um even though this bill allows
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
you to do it for 60 days wouldn't you
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
still only be allowed be reimbursed for
 
02:27:03.710 --> 02:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
a 30-day
 
02:27:07.030 --> 02:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
Supply it depends right so it depends on
 
02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance and the structure but what
 
02:27:12.750 --> 02:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
follow up follow I'm talking about I'm
 
02:27:15.150 --> 02:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
talking about New Hampshire Medicaid I
 
02:27:18.510 --> 02:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
mean regardless of what this bill does
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you still have to terms of
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
being reimbursed wouldn't you still be
 
02:27:25.389 --> 02:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
under the aices of what New Hampshire
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
the way New Hampshire Medicaid
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
reimburses as the way it I can relate
 
02:27:31.790 --> 02:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
this to how it works in the state of
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
Maine in that yes we would be restricted
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
and we'd only be reimbursed for whatever
 
02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
the insurance or Medicaid allows you to
 
02:27:40.830 --> 02:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed for so essentially it
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change any any they wouldn't
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
have to change their policy because we
 
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
passed this
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
law in Maine the way it's structured now
 
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
no okay thank you representative Lon and
 
02:27:55.870 --> 02:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
then representative McLean uh thank you
 
02:27:57.389 --> 02:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for bringing
 
02:27:59.630 --> 02:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
this knowledge I greatly appreciate it
 
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
um so you've had experience as a
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
hospital system pharmacist now you're in
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
a more um a more of an independent role
 
02:28:08.469 --> 02:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
sort of a community community- based
 
02:28:10.510 --> 02:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
oncologist and my understanding is
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
oncology move from these centers of
 
02:28:15.309 --> 02:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
excellence to having these these these
 
02:28:16.910 --> 02:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
Technologies and these treatments that
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
can really move to the community and are
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
sort of on on goinging um maintenance
 
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
ones because there's a lot more people
 
02:28:25.870 --> 02:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
living with cancer um not just fighting
 
02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
that end stage um so my first question
 
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
is because uh when you're able to do
 
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
that in office dispensing in Maine are
 
02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
you finding that in this Community
 
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
Practice you're able to follow up on
 
02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
signals like um side effects somebody
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
who's having fevers having rashes one of
 
02:28:43.950 --> 02:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
these indications that the therapy would
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
need to change faster than you would if
 
02:28:48.830 --> 02:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
somebody was going through a specialty
 
02:28:50.590 --> 02:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacy yes
 
02:28:52.030 --> 02:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
um and that's due to our current
 
02:28:54.429 --> 02:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
structure um that we have in place at
 
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
New England cancer specialist so we have
 
02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
a dedicated what we call an oral
 
02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
adherence program uh where 7 days after
 
02:29:04.750 --> 02:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
initiating therapy uh we are contacting
 
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
every single patient for our oral
 
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
anti-cancer medications um to ensure
 
02:29:14.110 --> 02:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
that um they know what the medication is
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
how they're taking it uh frequency for
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
which they're taking it and we're
 
02:29:21.790 --> 02:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
assessing any side effects and um a
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
distress scale on every essentially It's
 
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
weekly times four after initiating a
 
02:29:30.590 --> 02:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
therapy and then it goes out to monthly
 
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
thereafter um and so that's a
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort between pharmacists
 
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
um nurses um and provider visits that we
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
have and so we have a very Hands-On
 
02:29:42.429 --> 02:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
approach with these patients and
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
Incredibly Close monitoring okay follow
 
02:29:46.469 --> 02:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
up follow up um so it's great to hear
 
02:29:48.030 --> 02:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
that this actually increases patient
 
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
safety and probably patient outcomes by
 
02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
catching those early um my second
 
02:29:53.710 --> 02:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
question is because there's so many
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
different payers and you have employers
 
02:29:57.429 --> 02:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
who are self who have their own orisa
 
02:29:59.550 --> 02:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
programs the idea of opening it up so if
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
you have an employee who's um who is
 
02:30:04.309 --> 02:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
taking basically chronic chronic uh
 
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're taking this on a stable basis in
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
order to combat their cancer and keep it
 
02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
at Bay giving the ability to have 60
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
days or 90 days is something that
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
provides that flexibility for those
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
patients that it's appropriate for even
 
02:30:17.150 --> 02:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
though you wouldn't be even though
 
02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
obviously New Hampshire Medicaid
 
02:30:20.670 --> 02:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be taking advantage of so it
 
02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
has a benefit even if it doesn't help
 
02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
everybody would that be correct yes I
 
02:30:27.269 --> 02:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
think so thank you representative
 
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr chair um so you
 
02:30:32.349 --> 02:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there are patients that
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
are are stabilized and they're going to
 
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
go on to a maintenance mode um so in my
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
wife's case you know the the drugs have
 
02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
changed that hey you need to get a
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
90-day Supply and if you don't get a
 
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
90-day Supply we're not going to pay um
 
02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
so that L that landscape's been changing
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
on us recently so um do you see a
 
02:30:58.710 --> 02:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
problem with that where may be a benefit
 
02:31:01.950 --> 02:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
towards going to the 90 days or you feel
 
02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
the 60 days is fine I don't mean to beat
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
the 60 90 30 days to death but yeah I
 
02:31:09.150 --> 02:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
think due to the um so as many of you
 
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
may or may not know these medications
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
tend to be incredibly expensive um you
 
02:31:16.269 --> 02:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
know there's some therapies that can be
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
upwards of $20,000 a month uh for their
 
02:31:22.630 --> 02:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
prescription prescription cost so most
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
insurance companies aren't looking to
 
02:31:30.269 --> 02:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
mandate 90day supplies um there you know
 
02:31:31.950 --> 02:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
usually it's more on the we're only
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
going to allow 30 um and there are a few
 
02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
that at least that we currently fill for
 
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
now that are on the less expensive side
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies will allow
 
02:31:46.110 --> 02:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
us to extend out and so um I have not
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
personally experienced the situation in
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
which an insurance is mandated
 
02:31:50.479 --> 02:31:53.190 align:start position:0%
which an insurance is mandated
um

02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:56.429 --> 02:31:56.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I representative palaza thank you
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:32:01.950 --> 02:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
question do you have any numbers on um
 
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
share of your patients uh those who are
 
02:32:09.389 --> 02:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid those who are on other
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
insurances so um I can't share any
 
02:32:14.309 --> 02:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
information about Medicaid because um in
 
02:32:16.349 --> 02:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine we actually do not
 
02:32:18.510 --> 02:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
fill prescriptions for patients with
 
02:32:20.429 --> 02:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and that's
 
02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
um because we are not a licensed Retail
 
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy in the state of Maine so we do
 
02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
not fill um Medicaid prescriptions in
 
02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
the state we are allowed to fill for um
 
02:32:35.710 --> 02:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage um Medicare Part D um
 
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
and then depending on the commercial
 
02:32:40.190 --> 02:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
insurance plan Commercial Insurance is
 
02:32:42.750 --> 02:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
typically the the program or the groups
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
that will mandate these mail orderer
 
02:32:46.349 --> 02:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
specialty pharmacies whereas Medicare
 
02:32:48.429 --> 02:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
being more of an open
 
02:32:51.070 --> 02:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
market other question
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Merchant thank
 
02:32:58.389 --> 02:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
you one of the things I've looked at
 
02:33:00.830 --> 02:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
around the country is that the issue of
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
Physicians dispensing so if you have a
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
full-time pharmacist working for you now
 
02:33:07.710 --> 02:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
which is I want to commend you because
 
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
when I look at a lot of times medication
 
02:33:14.110 --> 02:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
errors in Studies have shown that
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
significant part of that is prescribing
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
which is caught by the pharmacist it's a
 
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
second set of eyes frankly and and
 
02:33:23.469 --> 02:33:23.479 align:start position:0%
working in a Cancer Center um we always
 
02:33:25.309 --> 02:33:25.319 align:start position:0%
had two sets of eyes on everything we
 
02:33:28.230 --> 02:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
did because Cancer drugs are very toxic
 
02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
and you don't have room for
 
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
error what's the reason or why we
 
02:33:35.389 --> 02:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't have an in-house Pharmacy so
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
you could build Medicaid you could build
 
02:33:39.309 --> 02:33:39.319 align:start position:0%
everybody else it's right there it's
 
02:33:42.190 --> 02:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
staffed by your staff there it's not
 
02:33:43.830 --> 02:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
open to the public I think it's kind of
 
02:33:46.269 --> 02:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
the concern we had before with the board
 
02:33:48.030 --> 02:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
was the way the laws written it had to
 
02:33:50.110 --> 02:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
sort of be retail you know looking for
 
02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
retail you're looking for your own
 
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
patients so what's the downside then of
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
having an in pharmacy license or permit
 
02:33:58.349 --> 02:33:58.359 align:start position:0%
by the board so you can do all these
 
02:33:58.359 --> 02:33:59.269 align:start position:0%
by the board so you can do all these
wonderful

02:33:59.269 --> 02:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
02:34:02.190 --> 02:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
things yeah I mean I I I don't want I'm
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
not sure I'm knowledgeable enough in all
 
02:34:06.190 --> 02:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire laws right now to
 
02:34:08.389 --> 02:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
like confidently say like or would there
 
02:34:10.750 --> 02:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
be more restrictions in place if you
 
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
were um licensed and would there be
 
02:34:15.349 --> 02:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
Staffing requirements as far as number
 
02:34:17.389 --> 02:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacists in place or number of
 
02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
technicians in place um so I'm not sure
 
02:34:22.429 --> 02:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
I'm in a good position to answer that
 
02:34:27.070 --> 02:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
but what I can comment on um you know at
 
02:34:28.990 --> 02:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
New England cancer specialist we do have
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
pharmacists um that are are involved in
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
this process and we have pharmacy tech
 
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
technicians that are involved in this
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
process as well and I was admittedly
 
02:34:40.670 --> 02:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
skeptical right of physician dispensing
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
when I used to work in the health system
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
world but what I've quickly recognized U
 
02:34:48.910 --> 02:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
working in this environment is that our
 
02:34:51.870 --> 02:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
practice is just as safe if not safer
 
02:34:53.469 --> 02:34:53.479 align:start position:0%
because we have more touch points with
 
02:34:55.269 --> 02:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
our patients and because of the
 
02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we have in place at
 
02:34:59.550 --> 02:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
New England Cancer Specialists um right
 
02:35:02.750 --> 02:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
now so we have a pharmacist again um you
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
know readily involved in this process um
 
02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
and we do have two sets of eyes on all
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
of our prescriptions before they're
 
02:35:13.389 --> 02:35:13.399 align:start position:0%
dispensed so I guess the question trying
 
02:35:15.230 --> 02:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
to understand is that if you have a
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
pharmacy permit there's no restrictions
 
02:35:20.429 --> 02:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
there's no 30day 60-day 90 you can do
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
control drugs you can do anti Medics you
 
02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
can do all kind you don't have any
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
limitations on oncology then we get into
 
02:35:29.710 --> 02:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
the disc discussion what is an analytic
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
it gets into the terminology why not
 
02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
have the board work with you folks and
 
02:35:37.230 --> 02:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
saying you have a permit and then work
 
02:35:39.269 --> 02:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
with the board through rulemaking to
 
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is that you're trying to
 
02:35:43.389 --> 02:35:43.399 align:start position:0%
accomplish and stay within the confines
 
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
of what we have today to allow for that
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
and as Leon talked about the other day
 
02:35:51.230 --> 02:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
if you have have a time in which there's
 
02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
not a pharmacist available for whatever
 
02:35:55.070 --> 02:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
reason the Physicians still on the short
 
02:35:57.349 --> 02:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
term could fill in for the pharmacist
 
02:35:58.630 --> 02:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
that have
 
02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
Point yeah I mean I think so in our
 
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
circumstance right at New England cancer
 
02:36:04.750 --> 02:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
specialist we have an instate pharmacy
 
02:36:07.790 --> 02:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
license so my understanding is that with
 
02:36:10.349 --> 02:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
our current situation we could dispense
 
02:36:15.790 --> 02:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
right we are not doing that now um and
 
02:36:17.469 --> 02:36:17.479 align:start position:0%
but to your point I mean I think I would
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
you know ultimately defer to NH o um and
 
02:36:23.670 --> 02:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
engage in discussions with them um but I
 
02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
think it comes down to what is the
 
02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
language within that specific Pharmacy
 
02:36:31.469 --> 02:36:31.479 align:start position:0%
permit um how restrictive would that
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy permit be to your I think you
 
02:36:37.590 --> 02:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned like if it allows a physician
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
um or another licensed professional to
 
02:36:41.150 --> 02:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
be involved in that process if a
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
pharmacist isn't present then in my
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
personal opinion then I'd be more open
 
02:36:48.870 --> 02:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
to that but um yeah I'll leave it at
 
02:36:52.030 --> 02:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
that so basic if understanding correctly
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
is that if we had something like that it
 
02:36:55.870 --> 02:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
would be up to the you working with the
 
02:36:58.349 --> 02:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy like we did with back
 
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
in the days with compounding versus um
 
02:37:02.429 --> 02:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
product preparation we worked with the
 
02:37:03.870 --> 02:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
board work through the process and it
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
worked very well okay yeah I'm not
 
02:37:09.070 --> 02:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with the any historical pieces
 
02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:09.910 align:start position:0%
familiar with the any historical pieces
here

02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
so okay uh just to point out we are
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
behind schedule and we'll continue with
 
02:37:16.349 --> 02:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
this hearing and my thought is we'll
 
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
just continue um right along and people
 
02:37:21.389 --> 02:37:21.399 align:start position:0%
can go to lunch as they as they wish at
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
their convenience rather than make the
 
02:37:26.110 --> 02:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
extend the day representative ever do
 
02:37:29.269 --> 02:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
you have any concern or oh I have many
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
concerns but I don't see what else we
 
02:37:34.349 --> 02:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
can do about them okay okay sorry uh any
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
other questions for this gentleman
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
before he
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
sir also signed up to speak is Tanya
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
I don't want to second guess what those
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
initials stand for so I'll let you tell
 
02:38:00.429 --> 02:38:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:02.550 --> 02:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
minutes can you push the button so the
 
02:38:05.230 --> 02:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
red comes up there you go thank
 
02:38:08.389 --> 02:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
you so I think it's good afternoon now
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon chairman McDonald and
 
02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
Tanya Carlton I've been a practicing
 
02:38:15.550 --> 02:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in New Hampshire across
 
02:38:17.790 --> 02:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
multiple Health Care Systems for over 20
 
02:38:20.269 --> 02:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
years uh currently I serving as the
 
02:38:21.910 --> 02:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Society
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
of Health System Pharmacists and I'm
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
here to testify for
 
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
nhsp um in opposition um to SB 458 in
 
02:38:33.550 --> 02:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
its current state and as I said I'm
 
02:38:35.349 --> 02:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
really going to keep it short and sweet
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
so um basically speaking to what
 
02:38:40.710 --> 02:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant was talking
 
02:38:43.309 --> 02:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
about is really why can't New Hampshire
 
02:38:45.710 --> 02:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
oncology and hematology why can't these
 
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
cancer set centers um simply request a
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacy license share so how can we fix
 
02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
the legislation to ensure that they're
 
02:38:57.870 --> 02:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
able to request a license to be able to
 
02:39:00.389 --> 02:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
dis dispense these medications according
 
02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
to other regulations that dispensing
 
02:39:05.710 --> 02:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacies are held to the other
 
02:39:08.190 --> 02:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
question is a 60-day supply they were
 
02:39:10.429 --> 02:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
looking to bridge the gap originally is
 
02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
what we heard from the provider um so 60
 
02:39:15.910 --> 02:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
days seems a little extensive if you're
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
looking for an emergency supply and
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
really what that is is so uh originally
 
02:39:24.269 --> 02:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
it was 90 it went down to 60 so if
 
02:39:25.550 --> 02:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
you're trying to bridge until the
 
02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
Specialty Pharmacy can fill the
 
02:39:30.389 --> 02:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
medication it may be more reasonable to
 
02:39:33.070 --> 02:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
to keep the supply to less than 30 days
 
02:39:36.070 --> 02:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
um for medication you know waste
 
02:39:39.469 --> 02:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
purposes and then um the last pharmacist
 
02:39:41.309 --> 02:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
spoke about the medically integrated
 
02:39:44.790 --> 02:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
dispensing Pharmacy and according to an
 
02:39:47.070 --> 02:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
ncoda which is a Grassroots not
 
02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization committed to
 
02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
developing unique resources to help
 
02:39:53.630 --> 02:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
medically integrated oncology teams
 
02:39:57.309 --> 02:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
deliver top care and MIP is a dispensing
 
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy within an oncology center of
 
02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
excellence that promotes patient
 
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
centered multi-disciplinary team
 
02:40:05.469 --> 02:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
approach so really what we're talking
 
02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
about is dispensing
 
02:40:10.349 --> 02:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
pharmacy at these practices so how can
 
02:40:12.750 --> 02:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
we ensure that they are able to be
 
02:40:15.309 --> 02:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
registered as a pharmacy so that they
 
02:40:17.790 --> 02:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
can bill the pharmacy
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
prescription benefit
 
02:40:21.550 --> 02:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
um so how do we ensure that they can do
 
02:40:24.670 --> 02:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank
 
02:40:27.070 --> 02:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
Weber so here's my question and you may
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
not be the right person to answer it but
 
02:40:36.830 --> 02:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
um you have some of the specialized
 
02:40:41.790 --> 02:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge on the one hand um we are
 
02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:43.550 align:start position:0%
knowledge on the one hand um we are
hearing

02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:40:46.110 --> 02:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:40:50.349 --> 02:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
practices that they would like to have
 
02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
their own
 
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacies we are hearing that they have
 
02:40:56.910 --> 02:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
talked to the Board of Pharmacy and the
 
02:40:59.110 --> 02:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy does not believe they
 
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
have the authorization to approve the
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
kinds of licenses that would be helpful
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
practices and you're saying that you
 
02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
02:41:20.910 --> 02:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
legislation so my question is how do we
 
02:41:22.990 --> 02:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
how in your opinion if you have one and
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
if this is an inappropriate question for
 
02:41:28.510 --> 02:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
you I'll that's fine just say so um how
 
02:41:32.110 --> 02:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
do we bridge that Gap because um it
 
02:41:34.590 --> 02:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
seems to me like we're beginning to get
 
02:41:36.670 --> 02:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
ourselves into an endless loop where
 
02:41:38.429 --> 02:41:38.439 align:start position:0%
everybody is referring things to the
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
next person and it's not going anywhere
 
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
yet I bring up Gary Merchant
 
02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
representative Gary
 
02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
Merchant okay to he can answer this
 
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
question but there there is an
 
02:41:51.190 --> 02:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an amendment where we
 
02:41:55.230 --> 02:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
can um change the rsas for the Board of
 
02:41:58.469 --> 02:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy to ensure that we have a clinic
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
dispensing Pharmacy category um for
 
02:42:04.269 --> 02:42:04.279 align:start position:0%
providers that would meet the needs of
 
02:42:06.510 --> 02:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
not just oncology providers but other
 
02:42:08.230 --> 02:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
providers that would be looking to
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
dispense medications out of their
 
02:42:13.110 --> 02:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
clinics so I believe that would be an
 
02:42:19.269 --> 02:42:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:21.550 --> 02:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right I guess we're all set
 
02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:25.630 align:start position:0%
okay all right I guess we're all set
thank

02:42:25.630 --> 02:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Heidi CR
 
02:42:33.790 --> 02:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
plans you asked uh three to four minutes
 
02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:41.950 --> 02:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
better good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um for the
 
02:42:45.309 --> 02:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
record my name is Heidi croll I work at
 
02:42:47.990 --> 02:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
Gallagher cahan andar trell um I'm
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
representing ahip which is America's
 
02:42:51.870 --> 02:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
health insurance plans and I will um yes
 
02:42:53.429 --> 02:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
I will do my best to keep this very
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
short um because a lot of what I have to
 
02:42:59.429 --> 02:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
say has already been said um so we are
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
um technically opposed uh to sp sp 458
 
02:43:04.389 --> 02:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
as amended by the Senate but I will say
 
02:43:06.269 --> 02:43:06.279 align:start position:0%
that you know we have had a number of
 
02:43:08.429 --> 02:43:08.439 align:start position:0%
conversations um discussions um
 
02:43:10.510 --> 02:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
correspondence with the Bill's Advocates
 
02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and we are very willing to um
 
02:43:14.429 --> 02:43:14.439 align:start position:0%
continue those discussions and work on
 
02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
amendments so um and we have two areas
 
02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
of concern or interest with the bill um
 
02:43:22.349 --> 02:43:22.359 align:start position:0%
which other speakers have raised as well
 
02:43:26.429 --> 02:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
um one is the 60-day supply um we think
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
that is uh too long for what's being
 
02:43:31.710 --> 02:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
contemplated in the legislation um and
 
02:43:33.870 --> 02:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
as you've heard um these supplies of
 
02:43:35.309 --> 02:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs are typically meant
 
02:43:37.710 --> 02:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
for treating chronic diseases where the
 
02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
patient's condition is stable um they've
 
02:43:42.150 --> 02:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
had experience being on the drug and
 
02:43:44.070 --> 02:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's clear that the drug is working for
 
02:43:46.030 --> 02:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
them um and they're not likely to have
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
to change treatments um and so so in
 
02:43:52.190 --> 02:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
those cases a longer term um
 
02:43:54.429 --> 02:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
prescription makes sense from both a
 
02:43:58.550 --> 02:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
care and cost perspective um but a a
 
02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
60-day supply is typically not um uh is
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
not what you would typically think of as
 
02:44:07.269 --> 02:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
necessary um to meet the immediate
 
02:44:09.790 --> 02:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
medical needs and that's the terminology
 
02:44:11.550 --> 02:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
that in the law currently where they're
 
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
trying to place this um the immediate
 
02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
medical needs of the patient um and it's
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
you know as you've heard also not what
 
02:44:19.870 --> 02:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
you would typically think of when
 
02:44:22.150 --> 02:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
treating a cancer patients um whose
 
02:44:23.870 --> 02:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
treatments can be subject to change
 
02:44:26.830 --> 02:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
depending on their condition um and as
 
02:44:29.150 --> 02:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
you've heard um these drugs are often
 
02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
considered to be specialty drugs um due
 
02:44:33.790 --> 02:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
to their cost and due to their potential
 
02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
changes in the patient condition um
 
02:44:38.349 --> 02:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
prescribing even a 60-day supply could
 
02:44:40.910 --> 02:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
lead to waste of the drug um and a waste
 
02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
of money which so we would share what
 
02:44:45.070 --> 02:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
you heard from the Department um of
 
02:44:47.550 --> 02:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services on that point
 
02:44:49.550 --> 02:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
um and then our other set of uh
 
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns falls into um
 
02:44:56.110 --> 02:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
again this question of whether um or not
 
02:44:57.710 --> 02:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
there would be the intention of having
 
02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
an in-house Pharmacy um that would be in
 
02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
network um and you know our
 
02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
understanding and I think it's been
 
02:45:06.990 --> 02:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
confirmed by the discussion here today
 
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
is that these oral anti-cancer drugs
 
02:45:10.590 --> 02:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
would be self- administered by the
 
02:45:12.309 --> 02:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
patient at home so they're not um
 
02:45:14.269 --> 02:45:14.279 align:start position:0%
physician administered in a health care
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
facility like the intervenous um
 
02:45:20.110 --> 02:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
medications are and um provide ERS um at
 
02:45:22.750 --> 02:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
least for um commercial insurance so I
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
represent plans that offer um fully
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
insured plans um providers cannot buy
 
02:45:29.590 --> 02:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
and Bill for outpatient drugs in the
 
02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
same way that they can for physician
 
02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
administer drugs um in a health care
 
02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
facility um so self-administered drugs
 
02:45:38.990 --> 02:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
do need to be dispensed by an outpatient
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacy that's in network or through a
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
provider's facility based Pharmacy
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's in network um and um if these are
 
02:45:49.309 --> 02:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
specialty drugs which very often they
 
02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
are many carriers do require that they
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
are filled through an in network
 
02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
Specialty Pharmacy um and in those cases
 
02:45:58.030 --> 02:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
typically they are limited um to a
 
02:46:02.469 --> 02:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
30-day Supply or less um so I'll leave
 
02:46:03.990 --> 02:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
it at that I'm happy to try to answer
 
02:46:06.030 --> 02:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
any questions and again as I indicated
 
02:46:07.349 --> 02:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work with any
 
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and we have been you know
 
02:46:12.269 --> 02:46:12.279 align:start position:0%
being kept in the loop and so happy to
 
02:46:15.630 --> 02:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
work on future uh amendments thank you
 
02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:16.670 align:start position:0%
work on future uh amendments thank you
representative

02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:46:19.990 --> 02:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
Weber so having listened to the
 
02:46:21.910 --> 02:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard so
 
02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
far um you're testifying that it needs
 
02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
to be a local in network
 
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and what we've heard for
 
02:46:34.429 --> 02:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
Testimony is those pharmacies do not
 
02:46:37.070 --> 02:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
dispense these
 
02:46:40.469 --> 02:46:40.479 align:start position:0%
medications and
 
02:46:46.510 --> 02:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:50.429 --> 02:46:50.439 align:start position:0%
outside so what I'm what I'm not
 
02:46:52.429 --> 02:46:52.439 align:start position:0%
understanding is why are you objecting
 
02:46:55.230 --> 02:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
to bringing the work
 
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
inhouse when you still as the pharmacy
 
02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:02.590 align:start position:0%
inhouse when you still as the pharmacy
benefits

02:47:02.590 --> 02:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:47:06.110 --> 02:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
providers have the ability to dictate
 
02:47:07.990 --> 02:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
how much is
 
02:47:10.030 --> 02:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
dispensed either through prior
 
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
authorization or through medication
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
limits or anything else why does it
 
02:47:17.389 --> 02:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
matter that they're allowed to do the
 
02:47:17.399 --> 02:47:18.950 align:start position:0%
matter that they're allowed to do the
dispensing

02:47:18.950 --> 02:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
dispensing
 
02:47:20.750 --> 02:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
because that seems to me to be a health
 
02:47:24.070 --> 02:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
care quality of care issue and I'm not
 
02:47:26.510 --> 02:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
sure why you're objecting to it if you
 
02:47:29.150 --> 02:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
can control it so so to be clear we're
 
02:47:31.630 --> 02:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
not objecting to it we we either use
 
02:47:34.750 --> 02:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
in-house facility pharmacies or
 
02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
specialty pharmacies for these types of
 
02:47:39.030 --> 02:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
drugs so as long as there's some sort of
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
inhouse or INF facility um pharmacy
 
02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
license that that's not a problem for us
 
02:47:48.510 --> 02:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
so if I if I said the word local I I did
 
02:47:52.110 --> 02:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
not that was so just just just to
 
02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
clarify for me because I'm now
 
02:47:55.110 --> 02:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
thoroughly confused because I thought
 
02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
you said you were objecting to the bill
 
02:48:00.269 --> 02:48:00.279 align:start position:0%
on two grounds one being that 60 days
 
02:48:03.950 --> 02:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
was too long and the other
 
02:48:06.750 --> 02:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
being uh it sounded to me like you were
 
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
objecting to the use of
 
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
inhouse we are not it's just that it's
 
02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
just that the legislation is not clear
 
02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
that there is going to be an in-house
 
02:48:20.550 --> 02:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
license for this purpose okay yes gotcha
 
02:48:21.790 --> 02:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so sorry for that
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding yep any other
 
02:48:27.469 --> 02:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
 
02:48:27.479 --> 02:48:31.070 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
thank

good afternoon Mr chairman also
 
02:48:58.870 --> 02:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
committee's members um for the record my
 
02:49:01.349 --> 02:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
name is Gary Merchant representative s
 
02:49:03.190 --> 02:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
County clar mon
 
02:49:05.469 --> 02:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
Troon I fully support the integrated
 
02:49:07.630 --> 02:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
model we used it many times at the
 
02:49:10.190 --> 02:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
medical center but the model was based
 
02:49:13.389 --> 02:49:13.399 align:start position:0%
upon the fact that we had a pharmacy as
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
well as we had the the clinic so we had
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
things that were infused to the patient
 
02:49:20.630 --> 02:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
but we at the same time had in-house
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy I think what it comes down to
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
is the fact there's confusion in the law
 
02:49:26.910 --> 02:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
which I totally understand because the
 
02:49:28.830 --> 02:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
way the law is written is more towards a
 
02:49:31.990 --> 02:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
retail pharmacy open to the public we
 
02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
don't want this open to the public we
 
02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
want it for their own patients Virginia
 
02:49:40.110 --> 02:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
South Carolina North Carolina uh Florida
 
02:49:42.790 --> 02:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
North Dakota all have what they call
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
in-house Pharmacy licenses they work
 
02:49:48.190 --> 02:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
very effectively so what we're trying to
 
02:49:49.550 --> 02:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
do with the with the law and I can bring
 
02:49:51.630 --> 02:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this is be sure the
 
02:49:55.590 --> 02:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
board has the statutory authority to
 
02:49:57.150 --> 02:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
issue a permit you want to call it a
 
02:50:00.229 --> 02:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
mini Pharmacy avoiding a lot of the
 
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
heavy regulations that are placed upon
 
02:50:03.309 --> 02:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
retail pharmacies because that's not
 
02:50:06.349 --> 02:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
what this is and I think going forward
 
02:50:10.190 --> 02:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
is allowing the patient the
 
02:50:13.070 --> 02:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have the same service
 
02:50:15.910 --> 02:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
levels they would have anywhere else if
 
02:50:17.389 --> 02:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies need to call out
 
02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
a specialty pharmacy then so be it they
 
02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
can apply as a specialty pharmacy and
 
02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:24.469 align:start position:0%
can apply as a specialty pharmacy and
become

02:50:24.469 --> 02:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
become
 
02:50:26.830 --> 02:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
um working with the insurance companies
 
02:50:29.469 --> 02:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
with the manufacturers that way so I
 
02:50:32.229 --> 02:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
think it's really a blend between a
 
02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
pharmacy internally that's not open to
 
02:50:36.429 --> 02:50:36.439 align:start position:0%
the public that but the board right now
 
02:50:38.630 --> 02:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's confusing there in the statute
 
02:50:41.830 --> 02:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
itself it's not clear so by making it
 
02:50:43.630 --> 02:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
clear that the Board of Pharmacy can
 
02:50:46.429 --> 02:50:46.439 align:start position:0%
issue a permit and then based upon how
 
02:50:48.309 --> 02:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
the permit wants to be utilized let the
 
02:50:49.990 --> 02:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
board make the rules and regulations
 
02:50:52.349 --> 02:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
around it work with the stakeholders
 
02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
through Ru making to be sure we can
 
02:50:57.229 --> 02:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
accommodate all the needs my fundamental
 
02:51:00.590 --> 02:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
concern is that when you're dealing
 
02:51:03.790 --> 02:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
with the process and you're dealing with
 
02:51:06.750 --> 02:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
what's in the states is anotic drugs
 
02:51:09.229 --> 02:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
well patients also need to take antia
 
02:51:11.150 --> 02:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
drugs they need to take things that are
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
not entics because they're part of
 
02:51:15.030 --> 02:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
adjunctive therapy so if they're going
 
02:51:16.349 --> 02:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
to have to go down to the pharmacy to
 
02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
get those drugs to begin with why they
 
02:51:20.190 --> 02:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
not getting the other drugs at the same
 
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
time so by having an in-house Pharmacy
 
02:51:25.150 --> 02:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
all those things can be taken care of at
 
02:51:27.190 --> 02:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
One-Stop shop for the patient convenient
 
02:51:28.830 --> 02:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
for the patient it follows the same
 
02:51:30.510 --> 02:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
Norms we have now with the insurance
 
02:51:33.030 --> 02:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
regulations as far as the reimbursement
 
02:51:35.150 --> 02:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
so that's my request to the board when
 
02:51:38.309 --> 02:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
testifying I have testimonial submit to
 
02:51:40.030 --> 02:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
the committee that I submitt it to the
 
02:51:42.550 --> 02:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
Senate as
 
02:51:44.750 --> 02:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative Merchant
 
02:51:47.150 --> 02:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative
 
02:51:51.510 --> 02:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant seeing that was easy that was
 
02:51:53.790 --> 02:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
easy okay no one else has signed up to
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
speak on Senate Bill 458 do anyone else
 
02:51:58.510 --> 02:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
wish to uh
 
02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
testify seeing no one uh I did get the
 
02:52:04.830 --> 02:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
blue sheet in the back and three people
 
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
did sign up one in favor and two
 
02:52:10.950 --> 02:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
opposed so with that I'm going to close
 
02:52:13.670 --> 02:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on Senate Bill
 
02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
458 and I am going to open the public
 
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%

and sorry to keep you waiting uh she is
 
02:52:27.950 --> 02:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of U Senate Bill 560

so welcome thank you very much Mr chair
 
02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
and good afternoon to you and the other
 
02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um my name is
 
02:52:36.910 --> 02:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
Shannon chandley I serve the people of
 
02:52:40.389 --> 02:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
District 11 in the state senate and uh I
 
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
come before you today to introduce
 
02:52:47.070 --> 02:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 560 I hope that uh I will
 
02:52:49.750 --> 02:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
help to bring you back into your
 
02:52:52.590 --> 02:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
schedule and on time um because I'm
 
02:52:56.349 --> 02:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
hoping that this will be a relatively um
 
02:52:59.950 --> 02:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
brief uh discussion on my part and
 
02:53:02.349 --> 02:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
presentation on my part and I I think
 
02:53:04.830 --> 02:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very straightforward bill it
 
02:53:07.469 --> 02:53:07.479 align:start position:0%
is a study committee Bill not something
 
02:53:10.349 --> 02:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
that all of us are always excited about
 
02:53:12.590 --> 02:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
but I think the topic is extraordinarily
 
02:53:15.349 --> 02:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
important and deserves to be considered
 
02:53:17.910 --> 02:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
by a committee of legislators who can
 
02:53:20.670 --> 02:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
then be Nimble in recommending any kinds
 
02:53:23.710 --> 02:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
of changes that may be necessary and can
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the very
 
02:53:29.670 --> 02:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
complicated issue of uh Pharmacy benefit
 
02:53:33.790 --> 02:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
manager operations um I brought forward
 
02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
this bill at the request of some others
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
including a pharmacist the history as we
 
02:53:41.269 --> 02:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
know is long and
 
02:53:44.750 --> 02:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
complicated um but also the current
 
02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
status is evolving and equally
 
02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:49.030 align:start position:0%
status is evolving and equally
complicated

02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
02:53:51.950 --> 02:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
I think that having a study committee
 
02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
made up of legislators who could um
 
02:53:57.550 --> 02:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
perform the duties as expressed in this
 
02:54:02.990 --> 02:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh bill would help us to uh draft future
 
02:54:05.830 --> 02:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislation if necessary and understand
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
the effects of pbms on our communities
 
02:54:11.429 --> 02:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
and help consumers and help to deliver
 
02:54:14.429 --> 02:54:14.439 align:start position:0%
um Better Health Care so with that I
 
02:54:16.830 --> 02:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
will take any questions but um really I
 
02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
can speak to the study committee more
 
02:54:21.429 --> 02:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
than I can speak to pbms at all so thank
 
02:54:23.110 --> 02:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you any questions for
 
02:54:25.550 --> 02:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
Senator chandley representative nut upam
 
02:54:27.349 --> 02:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
and then representative Merchant um
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Mr
 
02:54:30.309 --> 02:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:54:33.950 --> 02:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
question Senator um is it is it true
 
02:54:37.670 --> 02:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
that um prescription benefit managers
 
02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:40.279 align:start position:0%
their costs and charges are less
 
02:54:43.110 --> 02:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
transparent than most other areas of
 
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare so without making the um
 
02:54:51.309 --> 02:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
making a determination that the study
 
02:54:54.190 --> 02:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
committee might want to explore that is
 
02:54:57.389 --> 02:54:57.399 align:start position:0%
one of the charges to understand whether
 
02:55:01.110 --> 02:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
how um whether there are in fact savings
 
02:55:03.070 --> 02:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
or additional costs and how we can
 
02:55:05.150 --> 02:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
better understand it thank you you're
 
02:55:07.950 --> 02:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Merchant thank
 
02:55:10.269 --> 02:55:10.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and also thank you senator
 
02:55:11.630 --> 02:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill before the
 
02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
committee um it's a difficult subject
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
matter it's complex
 
02:55:21.990 --> 02:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
convoluted I would ask though would you
 
02:55:25.110 --> 02:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
be cons willing to consider when I look
 
02:55:27.150 --> 02:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
at the pharmacy supply chain we're
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
talking about this I'm also the chair of
 
02:55:30.910 --> 02:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
the drug affordability board what we
 
02:55:32.229 --> 02:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
found out is that there's the
 
02:55:34.469 --> 02:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have a role pbms have a
 
02:55:37.190 --> 02:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
role pharmacies have a role wholesalers
 
02:55:39.469 --> 02:55:39.479 align:start position:0%
have a role they're all impacting the
 
02:55:41.990 --> 02:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
ultimate price to the patient any
 
02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts about expanding this Beyond
 
02:55:46.030 --> 02:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
just looking at the pbms but looking at
 
02:55:47.630 --> 02:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
from soup the nuts and saying you know
 
02:55:50.349 --> 02:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
where is the transparency where are the
 
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
problems and not just try to take one
 
02:55:54.309 --> 02:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
player out of the whole
 
02:55:56.910 --> 02:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
group thank you for that question
 
02:55:59.510 --> 02:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative um I think the bill as
 
02:56:03.790 --> 02:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
drafted is sufficient in terms of it
 
02:56:07.469 --> 02:56:07.479 align:start position:0%
would in fact be a lot of work to do
 
02:56:09.870 --> 02:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
however I recognize wholeheartedly that
 
02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is now in your hands you're the
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee that will deal with it and I
 
02:56:18.309 --> 02:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
am um confident that any recommendation
 
02:56:21.910 --> 02:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
you make would probably be uh well and
 
02:56:26.309 --> 02:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh serveice well thank you other
 
02:56:29.590 --> 02:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
questions I'm saying n oh I'm sorry
 
02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:30.790 align:start position:0%
questions I'm saying n oh I'm sorry
representative

02:56:30.790 --> 02:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
Weber would you nevertheless agree that
 
02:56:39.070 --> 02:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
this charge as it is already is a huge
 
02:56:44.550 --> 02:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
bite for for people uh to deal with
 
02:56:46.190 --> 02:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that they will have
 
02:56:48.510 --> 02:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
help from any number of people who who
 
02:56:50.990 --> 02:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
who will come and testify and and help
 
02:56:52.950 --> 02:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
them with their deliberations I agree
 
02:56:55.309 --> 02:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
with that entirely thank
 
02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
you other
 
02:56:59.870 --> 02:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
 
02:57:07.790 --> 02:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:10.590 --> 02:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Senator
 
02:57:13.469 --> 02:57:13.479 align:start position:0%
Donna suusi welcome back Senator long
 
02:57:15.389 --> 02:57:15.399 align:start position:0%
time no see thank you yes thank you
 
02:57:16.910 --> 02:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman I've enjoyed my
 
02:57:18.910 --> 02:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
morning with the committee I'm Donna
 
02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
Susi I represent Senate District 18 the
 
02:57:24.229 --> 02:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
town of Lichfield and five boards in the
 
02:57:26.469 --> 02:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester I'm a co-sponsor of
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation and I would not repeat
 
02:57:31.830 --> 02:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
any of the points that my colleague made
 
02:57:33.950 --> 02:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
I think she stated the the purpose quite
 
02:57:37.790 --> 02:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
well I will say having served on other
 
02:57:39.469 --> 02:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
study committees regarding
 
02:57:42.670 --> 02:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals and specifically pbms I
 
02:57:45.150 --> 02:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
I do think it's time although the charge
 
02:57:48.630 --> 02:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
is extensive to continue to look look at
 
02:57:52.190 --> 02:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
this very complicated issue um we have I
 
02:57:55.830 --> 02:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
think at each turn um that study
 
02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
committees have made recommendations
 
02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
discovered new information and each time
 
02:58:03.469 --> 02:58:03.479 align:start position:0%
been able to work on things like prior
 
02:58:06.309 --> 02:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
authorization like Supply and those
 
02:58:09.229 --> 02:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
issues continue to evolve as the
 
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
availability of medical records evolves
 
02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
um as different professions prescribe in
 
02:58:17.590 --> 02:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
different ways um but the bottom line is
 
02:58:19.269 --> 02:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
I think this work is important to
 
02:58:21.870 --> 02:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
continue for consumers in the state of
 
02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so for those reasons Mr
 
02:58:26.510 --> 02:58:26.520 align:start position:0%

Curtis Barry from
 
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
pcma I'll let you tell us what pcma
 
02:58:48.990 --> 02:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
stands for
 
02:58:57.469 --> 02:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:00.309 --> 02:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
that good morning Mr chairman morning
 
02:59:01.990 --> 02:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee good afternoon
 
02:59:05.630 --> 02:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
actually I I apologize it is um my name
 
02:59:08.910 --> 02:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
is Curtis Barry uh here before you today
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
on behalf of as the chair mentioned pcma
 
02:59:13.229 --> 02:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
which stands for the pharmaceutical Care
 
02:59:15.429 --> 02:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
Management Association which is the
 
02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
national trade Association for the PBM
 
02:59:20.510 --> 02:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
industry PBM stands for pharmacy benefit
 
02:59:24.190 --> 02:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
manager um and I did not check off uh
 
02:59:26.510 --> 02:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
any position on the bill on behalf of
 
02:59:30.750 --> 02:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
pcma U pcma is um never been afraid of a
 
02:59:33.630 --> 02:59:33.640 align:start position:0%
study committee uh in fact we take
 
02:59:34.990 --> 02:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of every opportunity and
 
02:59:37.550 --> 02:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
relish the opportunity to explain how
 
02:59:40.830 --> 02:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
pbms save plan sponsors uh the people
 
02:59:43.750 --> 02:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
who contract with PBM money in their
 
02:59:47.389 --> 02:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy benefit program because the the
 
02:59:49.710 --> 02:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
entity in my opinion that's often left
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
out of these discussions are the people
 
02:59:54.510 --> 02:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
that pay for the premiums we hear a lot
 
02:59:56.550 --> 02:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
from pharmacists particularly The
 
02:59:59.030 --> 02:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
Independents um obviously the the
 
03:00:01.590 --> 03:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
commercial insurers uh we hear a lot
 
03:00:03.630 --> 03:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
about the patients but what gets lost in
 
03:00:05.229 --> 03:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
the discussion of the people that pay
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
the premiums that sponsor the benefit
 
03:00:08.229 --> 03:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:00:11.349 --> 03:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
employees uh so very briefly I've given
 
03:00:13.750 --> 03:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
you two pages I'm going to discuss them
 
03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
in in reverse order as Senator Susi
 
03:00:16.670 --> 03:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned there have been a number of
 
03:00:20.030 --> 03:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
studies regarding pbms uh in my time
 
03:00:22.429 --> 03:00:22.439 align:start position:0%
representing this organization which is
 
03:00:25.750 --> 03:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
longer than I can't or mention um
 
03:00:29.670 --> 03:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
but frequently it's just the PBM that's
 
03:00:31.269 --> 03:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
the focus of this and if you look at the
 
03:00:33.710 --> 03:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
language of the study it seems to be
 
03:00:36.229 --> 03:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy Centric and there are a number
 
03:00:38.110 --> 03:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
of other entities as representative
 
03:00:41.070 --> 03:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
Merchant alluded to uh that affect the
 
03:00:44.469 --> 03:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
pharmacy economics and that brings me to
 
03:00:46.750 --> 03:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
the first page this will give you a
 
03:00:48.750 --> 03:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
visual depiction of I think what
 
03:00:51.389 --> 03:00:51.399 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant was referring to
 
03:00:54.750 --> 03:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
um it is more complex than traditional
 
03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:55.950 align:start position:0%
um it is more complex than traditional
medical

03:00:55.950 --> 03:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
medical
 
03:00:58.710 --> 03:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and what we're discussing
 
03:01:01.110 --> 03:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
if you will in the current structure of
 
03:01:03.670 --> 03:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
the study committee is the right side
 
03:01:06.469 --> 03:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
how the pbms relate to the insurer and
 
03:01:09.870 --> 03:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
relate to um the patient and also
 
03:01:12.309 --> 03:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
there's a connection to the
 
03:01:14.830 --> 03:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacies what the study committee
 
03:01:18.229 --> 03:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't recognize is on the left side
 
03:01:21.349 --> 03:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
which is Pharma pricing it's very
 
03:01:24.590 --> 03:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
complex won't go into it here and then
 
03:01:26.590 --> 03:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
in the middle between the the the
 
03:01:29.190 --> 03:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and the pharmacy are
 
03:01:31.630 --> 03:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
entities known as either the wholesaler
 
03:01:33.550 --> 03:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
who actually sell the physical drug to
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
the to the pharmacy and their pricing um
 
03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
that relates to reimbursement Etc um but
 
03:01:43.070 --> 03:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
also an an entity known as a psao a
 
03:01:45.070 --> 03:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacy Services administrative
 
03:01:47.229 --> 03:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
organization that serves many functions
 
03:01:48.710 --> 03:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
I believe arily on behalf of
 
03:01:51.269 --> 03:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
Independents I could be wrong about that
 
03:01:53.469 --> 03:01:53.479 align:start position:0%
um but they have a role here too and in
 
03:01:56.670 --> 03:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
many instances the PSA are the same
 
03:01:59.269 --> 03:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
entity or there's significant ownership
 
03:02:02.469 --> 03:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
overlap with the wholesaler um which
 
03:02:06.070 --> 03:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
poses a unique circumstance so I would
 
03:02:08.389 --> 03:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Merchant um
 
03:02:10.469 --> 03:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
adding a few pieces to this study
 
03:02:12.550 --> 03:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't expand the workload too much
 
03:02:15.429 --> 03:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
it is a heavy lift I recognize that um
 
03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
but I think it's fair to the ire study
 
03:02:20.349 --> 03:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
to the entire picture to add a couple of
 
03:02:22.030 --> 03:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
pieces to this as well particularly on
 
03:02:25.229 --> 03:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
the psao and wholesaler end um happy to
 
03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
answer questions Mr chair thank you any
 
03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any questions I
 
03:02:34.870 --> 03:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
understand it's lunchtime
 
03:02:37.590 --> 03:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
well apparently maybe that's a factor
 
03:02:40.510 --> 03:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
but thank you thank
 
03:02:43.030 --> 03:02:43.040 align:start position:0%

testify on Senate Bill 560 does anyone
 
03:02:48.950 --> 03:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
else wish to testify

name is Regina burel state senator for
 
03:36:54.990 --> 03:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
district 19 which encompasses the towns
 
03:36:58.790 --> 03:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
of Derry Hamstead and Windham and I am
 
03:37:02.269 --> 03:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor and the only sponsor
 
03:37:03.910 --> 03:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
for Senate Bill
 
03:37:06.750 --> 03:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
400 um
 
03:37:09.150 --> 03:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
currently uh what this was brought to my
 
03:37:12.189 --> 03:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
attention um with the fact that uh when
 
03:37:15.710 --> 03:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
you have a patient that um is requesting
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
a copy of their records uh their medical
 
03:37:22.110 --> 03:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
records typically that uh those patients
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
get that when they access it directly or
 
03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
ask for it directly they get they get it
 
03:37:31.110 --> 03:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
for free but if something happens to
 
03:37:33.910 --> 03:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
that patient and either they can't
 
03:37:36.670 --> 03:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
request it or the family has you know
 
03:37:38.830 --> 03:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
maybe they're in a coma and they they
 
03:37:41.389 --> 03:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
can't request that information and they
 
03:37:45.870 --> 03:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
get the um attain the an attorney then
 
03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
that attorney if they request it then
 
03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
there have been bills that I have seen
 
03:37:55.590 --> 03:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
that go a, $2,000
 
03:37:59.070 --> 03:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
$3,000 so what happens at the end of
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
that if there's a case there and at the
 
03:38:04.750 --> 03:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
end of that case that patient is now
 
03:38:07.870 --> 03:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
paying the invoice for that for their
 
03:38:10.670 --> 03:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
own records so that's one of the reasons
 
03:38:16.590 --> 03:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:18.750 --> 03:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
for that I will take any
 
03:38:21.870 --> 03:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you there's uh others
 
03:38:24.110 --> 03:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
behind me that have detailed information
 
03:38:27.510 --> 03:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
on uh what's going on thank you
 
03:38:30.269 --> 03:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
questions for Senator
 
03:38:34.110 --> 03:38:34.120 align:start position:0%
berzel sen representative Leon can can I
 
03:38:37.070 --> 03:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
just add one thing um what we've done
 
03:38:39.830 --> 03:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
and let me address the bill I forgot to
 
03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
do sorry um what this bill does actually
 
03:38:48.710 --> 03:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
is um for electronic copies of Records
 
03:38:51.990 --> 03:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
it limits the amount to
 
03:38:55.590 --> 03:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
$6.50 and for paper copies the max that
 
03:38:59.950 --> 03:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:01.950 --> 03:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
$50 okay thank
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
you um thank you on thank you Mr
 
03:39:06.950 --> 03:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Senator um thanks
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill I know that
 
03:39:10.870 --> 03:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
access to medical records um can be a
 
03:39:12.590 --> 03:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
challenge for people especially if
 
03:39:14.429 --> 03:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
they're not Health literate or
 
03:39:16.229 --> 03:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy literate
 
03:39:18.710 --> 03:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
um so my question would be um if you
 
03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
would support um within this language
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
making it easier for somebody you know a
 
03:39:26.469 --> 03:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
spouse um I know that if you are to make
 
03:39:27.830 --> 03:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
the request where it still would go to
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
the patient um and it would still be
 
03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
able to have that delivery because you
 
03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
know you might not be able to argue that
 
03:39:35.229 --> 03:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
you're doing it on behalf of the patient
 
03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
if they're in a coma and they can't read
 
03:39:38.189 --> 03:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
it that gets to be a little bit
 
03:39:40.189 --> 03:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
different but if you have somebody who
 
03:39:41.309 --> 03:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't know how to ask for their
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
medical record appropriately and
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
effectively to be able to nominate
 
03:39:46.750 --> 03:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
somebody where they don't come take over
 
03:39:48.510 --> 03:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
all your healthare decisions but they
 
03:39:51.070 --> 03:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
can help you out in the request I I
 
03:39:53.189 --> 03:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
would consider it I would also ask that
 
03:39:54.750 --> 03:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
same question of some of the people
 
03:39:56.990 --> 03:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
following me because they probably and I
 
03:39:58.910 --> 03:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
know that there are some attorneys out
 
03:40:00.030 --> 03:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
there that
 
03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
actually um teach their clients how to
 
03:40:05.670 --> 03:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
ask for particular information because
 
03:40:11.790 --> 03:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
the bureau bu bureaucracy is so um big
 
03:40:13.750 --> 03:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
that they teach them how to ask for the
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
information that they need and I'm sure
 
03:40:17.750 --> 03:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
that they would do that with the uh
 
03:40:20.469 --> 03:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
family as well thank you that's
 
03:40:23.189 --> 03:40:23.199 align:start position:0%

03:40:26.870 --> 03:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
sharo thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
03:40:29.229 --> 03:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
for taking this question Senator um I
 
03:40:31.950 --> 03:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
wonder if you've had any discussions
 
03:40:34.830 --> 03:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
with experts in electronic medical
 
03:40:38.750 --> 03:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
records and whether they're I I don't I
 
03:40:40.349 --> 03:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
don't know enough about this but I
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
wonder if there are any concerns about
 
03:40:45.389 --> 03:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records being
 
03:40:48.670 --> 03:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
configured in a way that they can
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
be given over to patients or
 
03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
representatives of patients in an
 
03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:56.720 align:start position:0%

03:42:08.110 --> 03:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
family members or other Advocates to
 
03:42:10.590 --> 03:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
assist patients in assist in getting the
 
03:42:13.269 --> 03:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
records the current Amendment the bill
 
03:42:16.030 --> 03:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
does allow that it uh refers to the
 
03:42:19.710 --> 03:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
patient or the patient's request door as
 
03:42:23.710 --> 03:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
defined in Hippa and under Hippa that
 
03:42:27.309 --> 03:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
includes a parent a guardian an advocate
 
03:42:29.189 --> 03:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
a durable power of attorney a durable
 
03:42:31.469 --> 03:42:31.479 align:start position:0%
power of attorney for health care so all
 
03:42:34.910 --> 03:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
of those are encompassed already in the
 
03:42:37.910 --> 03:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
bill and its amended form by referencing
 
03:42:40.269 --> 03:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
the uh Hippa Federal
 
03:42:43.110 --> 03:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
Regulation and additionally by adding
 
03:42:45.870 --> 03:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
the patient request door that is when a
 
03:42:48.389 --> 03:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
patient hires a lawyer to work for them
 
03:42:50.309 --> 03:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
it would allow their lawyer to obtain
 
03:42:51.950 --> 03:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
their medical records at the same cost
 
03:42:54.750 --> 03:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
that the patient gets to receive
 
03:42:57.309 --> 03:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
them I'm going to give you the a brief
 
03:42:58.990 --> 03:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
background about why we think this is
 
03:43:01.149 --> 03:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
needed why it's so important to patients
 
03:43:04.389 --> 03:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
and to citizens in New Hampshire I'm
 
03:43:05.790 --> 03:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
also going to tell you a little bit
 
03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
about what you're going to hear and why
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
in the opposition to this bill and why
 
03:43:13.950 --> 03:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
we think that those concerns are
 
03:43:16.469 --> 03:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
misplaced and and finally um you're
 
03:43:19.189 --> 03:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
going to hear from my partner at
 
03:43:20.990 --> 03:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
Abramson Brown and Dugan Nick Abramson
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
and some other folks who were going to
 
03:43:24.590 --> 03:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
tell you about the more practical
 
03:43:26.349 --> 03:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
application and some of the bills that
 
03:43:27.790 --> 03:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
we've received for patient medical
 
03:43:29.469 --> 03:43:29.479 align:start position:0%
records that go into the thousands of
 
03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
dollars and it's just it's unreasonable
 
03:43:33.990 --> 03:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
for a patient to access their own me
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
information it should not cost that
 
03:43:39.910 --> 03:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
much so how we got here um as I'm sure
 
03:43:42.429 --> 03:43:42.439 align:start position:0%
all of you know almost all hospitals
 
03:43:44.189 --> 03:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Systems doctors offices are
 
03:43:45.830 --> 03:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
transitioning to electronic medical
 
03:43:47.710 --> 03:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
records as you were referencing and I
 
03:43:49.790 --> 03:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
think the goal ultimately is to get
 
03:43:52.950 --> 03:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
everyone on an electronic
 
03:43:55.550 --> 03:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
interoperable um format so all Health
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
Care Providers can access each other's
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
records and provide continuity of care
 
03:44:01.510 --> 03:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
and provide good treatment to their
 
03:44:04.030 --> 03:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
patients modeled on I think the VA
 
03:44:05.670 --> 03:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
medical centers were the first system in
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
the nation who adopted that format and
 
03:44:12.870 --> 03:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
the goal when um Hippa came out and all
 
03:44:15.469 --> 03:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
of the subsequent acts was to get all
 
03:44:17.469 --> 03:44:17.479 align:start position:0%
other hospitals on board with that
 
03:44:20.710 --> 03:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
format so information would be easily
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
accessible by patients and providers in
 
03:44:27.670 --> 03:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
2000 the Hippa Privacy Rule allowed
 
03:44:29.710 --> 03:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
access to an individual's electronic
 
03:44:32.070 --> 03:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
health record and it created or governed
 
03:44:33.750 --> 03:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
the rate that could be charged for a
 
03:44:36.030 --> 03:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
patient's access to that information and
 
03:44:38.590 --> 03:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
it was a reasonable cost-based fee at
 
03:44:41.590 --> 03:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
that time the problem is it wasn't
 
03:44:43.630 --> 03:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
defined what a reasonable cost based fee
 
03:44:47.550 --> 03:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
was so in 200 9 the high-tech Act was
 
03:44:50.429 --> 03:44:50.439 align:start position:0%
passed and it extended the rule to allow
 
03:44:52.229 --> 03:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
patients to direct their electronic
 
03:44:54.510 --> 03:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
health records to a third party in
 
03:44:56.630 --> 03:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
addition to accessing them themselves
 
03:44:59.070 --> 03:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
and in 2016 the US Department of Health
 
03:45:02.229 --> 03:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
and Human Services issued a guidance uh
 
03:45:04.830 --> 03:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
memorandum explaining that the patient
 
03:45:07.510 --> 03:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
rate which was limited to
 
03:45:11.469 --> 03:45:11.479 align:start position:0%
$66.50 or a reasonable cost generally
 
03:45:13.070 --> 03:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's been applied as
 
03:45:16.229 --> 03:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
$615 $65 50 cents excuse me to an
 
03:45:18.990 --> 03:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
electronic copy of your medical record
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
that that patient rate does apply to a
 
03:45:23.229 --> 03:45:23.239 align:start position:0%
third party directive so from that point
 
03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
forward in 2016 patients or their
 
03:45:27.590 --> 03:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys or their representative or
 
03:45:29.229 --> 03:45:29.239 align:start position:0%
their family member could request that
 
03:45:32.910 --> 03:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
patients record and pay $66.50 for an
 
03:45:37.070 --> 03:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
electronic version of the record um
 
03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
copies of paper versions of the record
 
03:45:40.790 --> 03:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
were charged whatever the state law
 
03:45:46.870 --> 03:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
provided for the costs in 2020 um one of
 
03:45:49.469 --> 03:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
the there's been an advent of thirdparty
 
03:45:52.670 --> 03:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
data vendors who have come into creation
 
03:45:54.990 --> 03:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
that are Contracting with hospitals to
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
make money and their hospitals are
 
03:45:59.349 --> 03:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
Contracting out their record request to
 
03:46:01.110 --> 03:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
these third-party vendors and these
 
03:46:03.469 --> 03:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
third-party vendors are obviously for
 
03:46:05.790 --> 03:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
profit so they want to make money one of
 
03:46:08.469 --> 03:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
those vendors sco in 2020
 
03:46:12.149 --> 03:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
challenged HHS guidance that the patient
 
03:46:14.510 --> 03:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
rate should apply to all requesters of
 
03:46:19.149 --> 03:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
medical records and the SC Court held
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
that Health and Human Services failed to
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
go through the proper administrative
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
procedure act channels to issue their
 
03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
memorandum of guidance and so because of
 
03:46:30.469 --> 03:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
that it didn't need to be followed by
 
03:46:33.070 --> 03:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
the thirdparty vendors after that point
 
03:46:35.429 --> 03:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
these thirdparty vendors who include sco
 
03:46:37.550 --> 03:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
or share care or now I think they're all
 
03:46:40.950 --> 03:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
under one umbrella called datab bant um
 
03:46:40.960 --> 03:46:43.189 align:start position:0%
under one umbrella called datab bant um
began

03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
began
 
03:46:45.429 --> 03:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
charging crazy amount for medical
 
03:46:48.269 --> 03:46:48.279 align:start position:0%
records we've gotten bills for $1,000
 
03:46:51.710 --> 03:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
$2,000 $4,000 for a patient's medical
 
03:46:54.030 --> 03:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
records just to get those records so the
 
03:46:55.590 --> 03:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
patient can find out what happened to
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
them during their medical
 
03:47:01.389 --> 03:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
care all of these
 
03:47:05.110 --> 03:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
um after the scx decision what happened
 
03:47:08.070 --> 03:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
is patients were still charged $6.50 for
 
03:47:09.630 --> 03:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
their medical records but anyone else
 
03:47:12.429 --> 03:47:12.439 align:start position:0%
making the request for a patient or any
 
03:47:14.070 --> 03:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
third party that the patient directed
 
03:47:16.590 --> 03:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
the records to go to reverted back to
 
03:47:18.550 --> 03:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
state law and these third party vendors
 
03:47:20.590 --> 03:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
started charging a search fee a
 
03:47:23.309 --> 03:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
retrieval fee plus whatever the paper
 
03:47:25.950 --> 03:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
records fee was in New Hampshire it's 50
 
03:47:28.510 --> 03:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
cents a page $15 for the first 30 pages
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
and 50 cents a page currently in our
 
03:47:35.429 --> 03:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
statute which is why if you have a 2,000
 
03:47:37.269 --> 03:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
page medical record it was costing
 
03:47:40.590 --> 03:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
$1,000 to get that for the patient and
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
that's a lot for any patient in New
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:49.830 --> 03:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
all of these medical records companies
 
03:47:52.710 --> 03:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
thrived under the prior rules they
 
03:47:54.229 --> 03:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
existed they were able to produce
 
03:47:57.469 --> 03:47:57.479 align:start position:0%
records for $6.50 they will come before
 
03:47:59.910 --> 03:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
you and testify today that they still
 
03:48:02.910 --> 03:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
only charge patients $6.50 because that
 
03:48:06.670 --> 03:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
is the cost um some of the reasons that
 
03:48:08.149 --> 03:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
they oppose this bill is because they
 
03:48:10.349 --> 03:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
are for profit corporations trying to
 
03:48:13.429 --> 03:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
make money and they're going to tell you
 
03:48:16.469 --> 03:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
that it's not as easy as a press of a
 
03:48:19.710 --> 03:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
button and download onto a disk that it
 
03:48:21.550 --> 03:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
costs a lot more money than that because
 
03:48:24.309 --> 03:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
they have to have a person who's looking
 
03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
at an authorization and a request and
 
03:48:28.910 --> 03:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you they go Page by Page
 
03:48:30.510 --> 03:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
through the medical records I submit to
 
03:48:31.950 --> 03:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
you that's not the case because we get
 
03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
medical records with other patients
 
03:48:38.149 --> 03:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
records included all the time but um the
 
03:48:40.309 --> 03:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
reason I think
 
03:48:43.750 --> 03:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's not well-placed is because there
 
03:48:45.870 --> 03:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
have been studies done that it costs
 
03:48:49.070 --> 03:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
between $2 and $10 to get an electronic
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
copy of records and we already know all
 
03:48:53.950 --> 03:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:48:55.790 --> 03:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
their Radiology departments if we make a
 
03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
request for a patient's x-rays their CT
 
03:49:00.830 --> 03:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
scans or MRIs the radiology department
 
03:49:02.670 --> 03:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
does the exact same thing that these
 
03:49:04.910 --> 03:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
thirdparty vendors do they look at the
 
03:49:07.149 --> 03:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
request they look at the authorization
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
they compare the date of birth on the
 
03:49:10.750 --> 03:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
patient they compare the medical record
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
numbers and then they download the disc
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
the uh all of the Imaging studies to a
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
dis and they provide the disc to the
 
03:49:19.790 --> 03:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
patient or the attorney if you could
 
03:49:21.870 --> 03:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
start wrapping up please yes everyone in
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
the state those Radiology images all of
 
03:49:27.229 --> 03:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
whenever we make those requests cost
 
03:49:29.870 --> 03:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
$10 Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center
 
03:49:31.510 --> 03:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
who's the largest medical provider in
 
03:49:33.550 --> 03:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire provides
 
03:49:35.670 --> 03:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
medical records for free to their
 
03:49:37.630 --> 03:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
patients they don't charge anyone
 
03:49:40.110 --> 03:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
because they obviously figured out the
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records process and
 
03:49:43.630 --> 03:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
they want their patients to access their
 
03:49:45.630 --> 03:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
information what this bill is going to
 
03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
do is go back to the HHS guidance of
 
03:49:51.790 --> 03:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
getting the electronic medical record
 
03:49:54.990 --> 03:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
cost down to $6.50 for patients or their
 
03:49:57.469 --> 03:49:57.479 align:start position:0%
requesters their family members or their
 
03:50:00.510 --> 03:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys for an electronic copy and
 
03:50:03.790 --> 03:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
capping the cost at $50 for a paper copy
 
03:50:06.510 --> 03:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
of the record almost everyone now wants
 
03:50:09.550 --> 03:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
electronic copies but obviously some
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
medical providers smaller providers
 
03:50:14.269 --> 03:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to transition the way
 
03:50:16.229 --> 03:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
Dart may have been able to so they do
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
have to provide paper records so we've
 
03:50:22.910 --> 03:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
made the cap $50 for paper records and I
 
03:50:25.030 --> 03:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
would submit to you that most of these
 
03:50:26.750 --> 03:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
smaller entities already are only
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
charging $15 for their medical records
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
um Nick bis who owns all of the
 
03:50:33.870 --> 03:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgical centers or most of
 
03:50:35.110 --> 03:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
many of them in the state of New
 
03:50:38.110 --> 03:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charges $15 for any patient
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
record request it's a flat fee that's
 
03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
what it is regardless of the format and
 
03:50:44.830 --> 03:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
I would submit that probably any other
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
provider could do the same thing thank
 
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for your time I'll
 
03:50:50.670 --> 03:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you may have
 
03:50:53.510 --> 03:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:50:55.950 --> 03:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
Weber as a followup to the initial
 
03:50:57.710 --> 03:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
question from representative leyon that
 
03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
you answered um I am now a little bit
 
03:51:03.189 --> 03:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
confused because uh you referred to the
 
03:51:07.149 --> 03:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
Hippa definition for a um requester but
 
03:51:09.030 --> 03:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
it says specifically for purposes of
 
03:51:11.590 --> 03:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
this section A requestor means the
 
03:51:13.750 --> 03:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
patient the patient's personal
 
03:51:13.760 --> 03:51:15.269 align:start position:0%
patient the patient's personal
representative

03:51:15.269 --> 03:51:15.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:51:17.670 --> 03:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
an individual authorized to access the
 
03:51:19.630 --> 03:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
patient's medical record through a valid
 
03:51:22.750 --> 03:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
power of attorney or the patient's
 
03:51:25.349 --> 03:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
attorney so that's in the definitional
 
03:51:25.359 --> 03:51:26.670 align:start position:0%
attorney so that's in the definitional
section

03:51:26.670 --> 03:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:51:30.630 --> 03:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
here and my question
 
03:51:30.640 --> 03:51:33.030 align:start position:0%
here and my question
is

03:51:33.030 --> 03:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
um am I right in assuming that doesn't
 
03:51:37.710 --> 03:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
include parents because it doesn't say
 
03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
parents and secondly
 
03:51:44.110 --> 03:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
um when we say the patient's personal
 
03:51:45.750 --> 03:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
represent ative are we talking
 
03:51:47.830 --> 03:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
specifically about executive or
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
administrator of an estate or are we
 
03:51:52.149 --> 03:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
talking about something else that would
 
03:51:54.429 --> 03:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
include an executive an administrator
 
03:51:56.910 --> 03:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately appointed by a court
 
03:51:59.710 --> 03:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
followup followup it does it include
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else other than those uh it
 
03:52:05.550 --> 03:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
would just include the definitional um
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
group that is listed in here but I
 
03:52:09.309 --> 03:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
believe that the reference in the
 
03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph preceding that the patient or
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
the patient's requesters shall be
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
entitled to such records as regulated by
 
03:52:16.670 --> 03:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
the health insurance portability and
 
03:52:19.030 --> 03:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
accountability act I think that adds in
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
whatever additional um
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives that are listed in Hippa
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay would you agree to with me that the
 
03:52:31.830 --> 03:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
specific usually usually controls over
 
03:52:34.670 --> 03:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
the broader and farther away as a matter
 
03:52:36.269 --> 03:52:36.279 align:start position:0%
of statutory
 
03:52:39.630 --> 03:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
construction and and and my followup
 
03:52:42.750 --> 03:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
really is rather than arguing those
 
03:52:47.670 --> 03:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
legalistic things my concern is making
 
03:52:51.429 --> 03:52:51.439 align:start position:0%
this so broad that people access other
 
03:52:54.189 --> 03:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
people's Medical Records who shouldn't
 
03:52:56.349 --> 03:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
so I want to know what the protections
 
03:53:00.790 --> 03:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
are there uh as as one who is more
 
03:53:02.830 --> 03:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the specific language
 
03:53:04.389 --> 03:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
and not comfortable with anything
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
broader even though Hippa
 
03:53:10.550 --> 03:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
May approve it we have our
 
03:53:10.560 --> 03:53:12.550 align:start position:0%
May approve it we have our
constitutional

03:53:12.550 --> 03:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
03:53:15.229 --> 03:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
amendment I would hope
 
03:53:16.670 --> 03:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you very much
 
03:53:18.510 --> 03:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for your question I
 
03:53:19.830 --> 03:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
would hope that this isn't going to
 
03:53:21.510 --> 03:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
allow anyone to access anyone else's
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
Medical Records I think those are
 
03:53:25.550 --> 03:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
protected by Hippa and the specific
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
definition that is in here is
 
03:53:31.910 --> 03:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
exactly as it should be I would defer to
 
03:53:33.830 --> 03:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
you and the wisdom of the legislature
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
and your colleagues with um how narrow
 
03:53:40.070 --> 03:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
the request should be we just feel that
 
03:53:42.030 --> 03:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
all patients and their representatives
 
03:53:44.110 --> 03:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
including their lawyers if they've hired
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
a lawyer to work for them should be able
 
03:53:47.349 --> 03:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
to access their records at a reasonable
 
03:53:49.309 --> 03:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
cost thank you very much for that
 
03:53:52.950 --> 03:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant representative
 
03:53:55.189 --> 03:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
L thank you Mr
 
03:53:57.950 --> 03:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I concur with what I think repr
 
03:53:59.950 --> 03:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
Weber is trying to get to is that the
 
03:54:01.630 --> 03:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
definition of patients personal
 
03:54:04.710 --> 03:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
representative is that defined
 
03:54:07.269 --> 03:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
anywhere if it is where would I find it
 
03:54:09.510 --> 03:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
I believe that there is a definition in
 
03:54:11.429 --> 03:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
the hip of Regulation and I'm sorry I
 
03:54:13.790 --> 03:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
don't have that with me I can certainly
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
submit some following this to answer
 
03:54:17.950 --> 03:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
that question if you'd like if if you
 
03:54:20.630 --> 03:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
would please because if we're going to
 
03:54:22.990 --> 03:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
refer to something in federal statute be
 
03:54:25.710 --> 03:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
clear what we're referring to um I would
 
03:54:29.830 --> 03:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
like to include somehow excuse me um a
 
03:54:31.149 --> 03:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
definition of patient's personal
 
03:54:32.269 --> 03:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative because I'm thinking
 
03:54:34.429 --> 03:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
about it if I go in for something on
 
03:54:36.429 --> 03:54:36.439 align:start position:0%
behalf of my spouse or my children or my
 
03:54:38.910 --> 03:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
grandfather whatever it may be is how do
 
03:54:40.309 --> 03:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
we Define
 
03:54:42.429 --> 03:54:42.439 align:start position:0%
that outside of having a power of
 
03:54:42.439 --> 03:54:45.670 align:start position:0%
that outside of having a power of
attorney

03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:49.630 --> 03:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.750 --> 03:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative well we can
 
03:54:55.590 --> 03:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.229 --> 03:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
it okay I'll set m i again um follow
 
03:55:05.389 --> 03:55:05.399 align:start position:0%
follow please so I thank to Cal there is
 
03:55:07.830 --> 03:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
a definition in the federal statute my
 
03:55:10.030 --> 03:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
concern is that if that definition
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
changes how do we track it down should
 
03:55:15.550 --> 03:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
we try to be redundant it and put it
 
03:55:17.950 --> 03:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
into definition with our own state law
 
03:55:19.550 --> 03:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
so with the state of law is governing it
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
not the federal law even though the one
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
and the same so if something changes
 
03:55:24.510 --> 03:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
federally we're not impacting what we
 
03:55:27.229 --> 03:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
have at the
 
03:55:30.830 --> 03:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
state I'm not sure if I understand your
 
03:55:33.990 --> 03:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
question or maybe I'm I'm not sure if I
 
03:55:35.630 --> 03:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't have the answer to that on
 
03:55:37.670 --> 03:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
how we would track the federal changes I
 
03:55:38.910 --> 03:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
I hope
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
that we'd be able to keep track of that
 
03:55:44.309 --> 03:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
as they do change it's been sometimes
 
03:55:46.309 --> 03:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
concerned when we refer to something at
 
03:55:48.990 --> 03:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
the federal statute that we as a state
 
03:55:50.750 --> 03:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
legislative body don't have control over
 
03:55:53.429 --> 03:55:53.439 align:start position:0%
it so therefore if we put the language
 
03:55:55.710 --> 03:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
in our state statute if the federal
 
03:55:57.870 --> 03:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
government changes their definition
 
03:55:59.830 --> 03:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
we're not obligated to follow their
 
03:56:01.349 --> 03:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
definition we still going to follow our
 
03:56:01.359 --> 03:56:02.950 align:start position:0%
definition we still going to follow our
definition

03:56:02.950 --> 03:56:02.960 align:start position:0%

03:56:05.950 --> 03:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
03:56:07.349 --> 03:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
03:56:10.309 --> 03:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
and answering some hard questions um I'm
 
03:56:12.469 --> 03:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you're aware that Hippa
 
03:56:14.830 --> 03:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
allows state law to be more protect of
 
03:56:16.830 --> 03:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
personal privacy than the federal
 
03:56:19.469 --> 03:56:19.479 align:start position:0%
statutes um because of that and because
 
03:56:22.670 --> 03:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
of this confusion over the language I'd
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
also like to sort of third the request
 
03:56:26.429 --> 03:56:26.439 align:start position:0%
to help us get a specific list of
 
03:56:28.550 --> 03:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
specifically what should be enumerated
 
03:56:31.110 --> 03:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
in the requester just so that it can be
 
03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
clear in New Hampshire law and apparent
 
03:56:35.830 --> 03:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
to apparent to a wife who's trying to
 
03:56:37.229 --> 03:56:37.239 align:start position:0%
help her husband to get his medical
 
03:56:38.550 --> 03:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
records because he's not a good
 
03:56:40.349 --> 03:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
communicator just so that somebody can
 
03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
look at our law and understand what
 
03:56:43.510 --> 03:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
their rights are so I'd really
 
03:56:45.469 --> 03:56:45.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate just helping us clarify that
 
03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
language okay thank you thank you
 
03:56:50.429 --> 03:56:50.439 align:start position:0%
representative representative Seth King
 
03:56:51.830 --> 03:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:56:51.840 --> 03:56:52.630 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
taking

03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
taking
 
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
questions this is not a topic I have
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
ever thought about before um so this
 
03:57:01.389 --> 03:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
could be a not a very well-informed
 
03:57:03.870 --> 03:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
question but I do understand economics a
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
little bit and when it comes to the cost
 
03:57:11.229 --> 03:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
that is borne by the healthcare
 
03:57:14.590 --> 03:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
providers to pull up these these records
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
and give it to the the requester um
 
03:57:19.870 --> 03:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
there is a cost we agree on that
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely and it seems some providers
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
have decided to just not charge like
 
03:57:28.110 --> 03:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth some are doing a flat fee of
 
03:57:31.590 --> 03:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
$15 and some are charging what as
 
03:57:35.550 --> 03:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
ostensibly the full cost of providing
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
these records to you know to they're
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
charging that to the one requesting them
 
03:57:43.590 --> 03:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
um do you in in your experience or do
 
03:57:45.990 --> 03:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
you have any evidence to support any
 
03:57:48.429 --> 03:57:48.439 align:start position:0%
idea that the companies that are
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
charging the requesters the full amount
 
03:57:54.510 --> 03:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
are they wildly overcharging what it
 
03:57:57.950 --> 03:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
actually costs the company or are they
 
03:58:00.149 --> 03:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
basically just charging them what the
 
03:58:02.830 --> 03:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
company is is is is what it's costing
 
03:58:04.950 --> 03:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
the company and and maybe a little bit
 
03:58:07.550 --> 03:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
more do you see what I'm saying here so
 
03:58:07.560 --> 03:58:09.510 align:start position:0%
more do you see what I'm saying here so
respectfully

03:58:09.510 --> 03:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
03:58:12.070 --> 03:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't say that they're charging
 
03:58:13.670 --> 03:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
what the cost is I would say that
 
03:58:14.950 --> 03:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
they're charging charging the maximum
 
03:58:17.110 --> 03:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
amount they're allowed to by Statute so
 
03:58:20.189 --> 03:58:20.199 align:start position:0%
they can um make a profit because
 
03:58:22.670 --> 03:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
they're for-profit corporations uh there
 
03:58:25.750 --> 03:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
is absolutely a cost in this for
 
03:58:28.030 --> 03:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
electronic versions of medical records
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
though it certainly doesn't cost 50
 
03:58:32.950 --> 03:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
cents a page to produce an electronic
 
03:58:34.590 --> 03:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
copy of medical records it doesn't cost
 
03:58:37.110 --> 03:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
$1,000 to produce a 2,000 page medical
 
03:58:39.429 --> 03:58:39.439 align:start position:0%
record I would submit respectfully that
 
03:58:41.309 --> 03:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
it would be more akin to the charges
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
that a radiology department is incurring
 
03:58:45.469 --> 03:58:45.479 align:start position:0%
when they're doing exactly the same
 
03:58:46.870 --> 03:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
thing that these vendors are doing
 
03:58:48.870 --> 03:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the record requests
 
03:58:50.269 --> 03:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the hippoc compliant
 
03:58:52.750 --> 03:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
authorization they're double-checking
 
03:58:54.189 --> 03:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
all of the information to make sure they
 
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
aren't mispro anyone else's information
 
03:58:58.910 --> 03:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
and then they're downloading it to a dis
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
followup follow up okay so um you've got
 
03:59:05.710 --> 03:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
some providers like Dartmouth that are
 
03:59:06.990 --> 03:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
not charging anything and others that
 
03:59:11.269 --> 03:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
are doing a flat fee um assuming now
 
03:59:12.910 --> 03:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
that they do have a cost that they have
 
03:59:14.750 --> 03:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
to bear and they're not charging the
 
03:59:17.830 --> 03:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
requestor any amount of money in order
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
to cover their bottom line they is
 
03:59:24.269 --> 03:59:24.279 align:start position:0%
they're they're likely charging all of
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
the other customers that are not
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
requesting their their data they're
 
03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
charging them to kind of make up for it
 
03:59:34.750 --> 03:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
in a way does that make sense so I mean
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
they have to get that money from
 
03:59:37.870 --> 03:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere instead of charging the person
 
03:59:39.870 --> 03:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
requesting now they're just charging
 
03:59:41.269 --> 03:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
everybody else a little bit more for
 
03:59:43.429 --> 03:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
their bill to make up for what they have
 
03:59:44.550 --> 03:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
to bear
 
03:59:44.560 --> 03:59:45.550 align:start position:0%
to bear
the

03:59:45.550 --> 03:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:59:48.389 --> 03:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
cost I understand what you're saying and
 
03:59:51.110 --> 03:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I'm not a medical billing
 
03:59:52.349 --> 03:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
expert so I don't think I'm the
 
03:59:53.950 --> 03:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate person to answer that but I
 
03:59:56.110 --> 03:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
do understand where you're saying about
 
03:59:59.550 --> 03:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
cost sharing but I would submit that um
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
the patient when they pay for their
 
04:00:03.269 --> 04:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
medical visit they're paying for the
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
doctor's time where their insurance
 
04:00:06.590 --> 04:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
company pays for their medical visit
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
they are paying for that record to be
 
04:00:10.790 --> 04:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
created our statute even says that the
 
04:00:12.750 --> 04:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
record and the information in it is the
 
04:00:14.189 --> 04:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
property of the patient because they
 
04:00:15.670 --> 04:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
have paid for that through their medical
 
04:00:18.269 --> 04:00:18.279 align:start position:0%
visit so I would submit
 
04:00:20.950 --> 04:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
that even if costs are shared that's
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
already incorporated into the creation
 
04:00:25.269 --> 04:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
of the record itself because it has to
 
04:00:28.030 --> 04:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
be by Statute that's part of part of
 
04:00:30.269 --> 04:00:30.279 align:start position:0%
Medical Care is creating a record of
 
04:00:31.870 --> 04:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
that care and that record is the
 
04:00:34.590 --> 04:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
property of the patient okay thank you
 
04:00:35.950 --> 04:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt and then
 
04:00:35.960 --> 04:00:37.710 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt and then
representative

04:00:37.710 --> 04:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:40.710 --> 04:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
Shapiro oh okay representative Shapiro
 
04:00:42.830 --> 04:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:00:46.590 --> 04:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:49.990 --> 04:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
um I think you would agree that um
 
04:00:52.429 --> 04:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
someone's attorney is not entitled to
 
04:00:52.439 --> 04:00:53.990 align:start position:0%
someone's attorney is not entitled to
their

04:00:53.990 --> 04:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:00:56.030 --> 04:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
um to
 
04:00:59.229 --> 04:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
someone's to their client's record
 
04:01:01.030 --> 04:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
because they're their attorney they're
 
04:01:03.510 --> 04:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
entitled to the client's record because
 
04:01:07.510 --> 04:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
the client is given explicit permission
 
04:01:10.229 --> 04:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
for the for the record to be released to
 
04:01:12.189 --> 04:01:12.199 align:start position:0%
the attorney yes so it's not the
 
04:01:13.950 --> 04:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
relationship it's the release of
 
04:01:16.750 --> 04:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
information absolutely so I don't see
 
04:01:19.750 --> 04:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
that mentioned in here at all um it's
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
there just a reference to the fact that
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
certain people representative and
 
04:01:25.990 --> 04:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
attorney Etc are entitled to these
 
04:01:28.349 --> 04:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
records now maybe this is covered under
 
04:01:31.389 --> 04:01:31.399 align:start position:0%
the as regulated by the health insurance
 
04:01:33.229 --> 04:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
portability portability and
 
04:01:37.950 --> 04:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
accountability act um but I I don't know
 
04:01:41.870 --> 04:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't know that it is explicitly
 
04:01:44.469 --> 04:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
and I guess I would like to see that be
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
more explicit in the um language of the
 
04:01:49.870 --> 04:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
legislation may maybe I'm missing this
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
but um do so do you do you understand
 
04:01:57.309 --> 04:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
the the concern thank you representative
 
04:02:00.510 --> 04:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
shiiro I think that I do and um
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
generally I'm not sure if I have an
 
04:02:04.229 --> 04:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate answer to that but I can
 
04:02:06.309 --> 04:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm happy to look into that
 
04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
further um generally any record request
 
04:02:11.309 --> 04:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
so even if the patient is requesting it
 
04:02:13.510 --> 04:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
themselves they have to sign a hip a
 
04:02:15.389 --> 04:02:15.399 align:start position:0%
comp authorization to the medical
 
04:02:17.110 --> 04:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
provider and if an attorney was
 
04:02:18.389 --> 04:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
requesting it for the patient the
 
04:02:20.269 --> 04:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
patient has to sign that as well the
 
04:02:22.269 --> 04:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
attorney can't just make a request and
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
ask for or get records follow follow up
 
04:02:27.990 --> 04:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm very well aware of that and
 
04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
I I just you know hope that we're not
 
04:02:35.790 --> 04:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
um un unintentionally changing that by
 
04:02:37.710 --> 04:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
by wording this the way we're wording it
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
so and and even if it is um explicit
 
04:02:45.229 --> 04:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
under the Hippa
 
04:02:47.309 --> 04:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
um regulation that you mentioned here I
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
think it would be a good idea for that
 
04:02:51.630 --> 04:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
to be explicit in the language of the
 
04:02:54.630 --> 04:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you representative
 
04:02:54.640 --> 04:02:57.790 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you representative
representative

04:02:57.790 --> 04:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:01.229 --> 04:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
Weber and I'm am I correct in thinking
 
04:03:03.389 --> 04:03:03.399 align:start position:0%
that attorneys requesting a patient
 
04:03:05.269 --> 04:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
records are also Bound by their own
 
04:03:07.950 --> 04:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
ethical considerations which would
 
04:03:11.070 --> 04:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from accessing for any
 
04:03:13.110 --> 04:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
purpose other than what they were
 
04:03:16.309 --> 04:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
specifically employed by the patient to
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
do absolutely thank you yes
 
04:03:20.000 --> 04:03:21.990 align:start position:0%
do absolutely thank you yes
representative

04:03:21.990 --> 04:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:03:24.030 --> 04:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
kofalt uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so I
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
guess following on on that last Point um
 
04:03:32.830 --> 04:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
so if an attorney is
 
04:03:35.389 --> 04:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
requesting patient records with the
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
patient's permission and if that is
 
04:03:41.950 --> 04:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
let's say a malpractice suit does that
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
not put healthc care providers in the
 
04:03:48.670 --> 04:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
unusual position of co-funding um
 
04:03:50.910 --> 04:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
co-funding litigation against them
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
potentially um
 
04:03:57.030 --> 04:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
if if if limiting if if this limit on
 
04:03:59.189 --> 04:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
the cost of medical
 
04:04:01.790 --> 04:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
records um applies not only to the
 
04:04:04.189 --> 04:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
patient but to the patient's attorney
 
04:04:06.309 --> 04:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
and if we recognize that the cost of
 
04:04:10.149 --> 04:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
delivering those records um may very
 
04:04:11.910 --> 04:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
well be higher than
 
04:04:15.070 --> 04:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
the the amount set here in
 
04:04:18.149 --> 04:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
statute it we're we're we're sort of
 
04:04:19.790 --> 04:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that on some level the
 
04:04:23.309 --> 04:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
medical providers are are funding that
 
04:04:27.830 --> 04:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
um it just it's it seems um unusual to
 
04:04:30.510 --> 04:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
me then that that medical providers
 
04:04:34.030 --> 04:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
are are are on the hook to subsidize
 
04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
litigation against them does that does
 
04:04:38.229 --> 04:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
that make sense I mean it's a little bit
 
04:04:40.630 --> 04:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
of a I think I understand your question
 
04:04:43.349 --> 04:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you um I would
 
04:04:46.349 --> 04:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
respect disagree because the record
 
04:04:48.309 --> 04:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
itself is the property of the patient
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
it's not um when the patient had that
 
04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
medical visit it's their property and
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
many times patients are requesting
 
04:04:57.469 --> 04:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
medical records or attorneys are
 
04:04:59.309 --> 04:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
requesting records not for malpractice
 
04:05:00.670 --> 04:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
suits it might be a social security
 
04:05:02.189 --> 04:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
disability suit it might be a life
 
04:05:04.149 --> 04:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
insurance claim it might be I mean
 
04:05:05.870 --> 04:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
there's any number of iterations that it
 
04:05:08.030 --> 04:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
may be for I know your example it's a
 
04:05:09.510 --> 04:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
malpractice claim and whether it would
 
04:05:11.990 --> 04:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
be funding litigation but I would submit
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
that it's not because
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
the record is the property of the
 
04:05:17.269 --> 04:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
patient which is why they don't charge
 
04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
the patient or they only charge the
 
04:05:22.750 --> 04:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
$6.50 that's already included in the
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
cost of their health care that they have
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
paid for for that
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
visit representative
 
04:05:34.510 --> 04:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
Weber and also following up on the same
 
04:05:34.520 --> 04:05:36.309 align:start position:0%
Weber and also following up on the same
line

04:05:36.309 --> 04:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm recalling my days when I was in
 
04:05:42.870 --> 04:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
active practice of Law and there too the
 
04:05:46.149 --> 04:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
records belong to the client they're
 
04:05:47.910 --> 04:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
their records and they can come and get
 
04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
them and take them away any day they
 
04:05:51.269 --> 04:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
want it and I practiced back in the late
 
04:05:52.910 --> 04:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
Stone Age where we would hand them a
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
file folder and admittedly medical
 
04:05:59.510 --> 04:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
records are way more complex than that
 
04:06:05.229 --> 04:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
now but isn't the
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
um an the analogy that we used back the
 
04:06:12.670 --> 04:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
model that we used back then was that
 
04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
the record Bel to the patient and went
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
with the Pati patient physically in
 
04:06:23.070 --> 04:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
those days um but we kept copies for our
 
04:06:25.550 --> 04:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
protection so we absorbed the cost of
 
04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
the copying because we were keeping them
 
04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
for our protection not not for the
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
patient benefit uh but here there there
 
04:06:36.670 --> 04:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
are dual benefits but one one is that
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
the record absolutely belongs to the
 
04:06:40.750 --> 04:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
patient and they could go to another
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
provider and ask for the records to be
 
04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
sent if they are AR already available
 
04:06:48.830 --> 04:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
but this is more complicated
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
because the Prov the patient may in some
 
04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
cases want to go on being the patient of
 
04:06:56.189 --> 04:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
the provider they're they're not using
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
them for
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
malpractice and so it's important to
 
04:07:03.149 --> 04:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
have the copies both places is that TR
 
04:07:05.309 --> 04:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
true absolutely the medical provider
 
04:07:08.830 --> 04:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
would I presume always retain a copy
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
right the patient's just receiving a
 
04:07:13.349 --> 04:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
copy of their medical record right okay
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:20.110 --> 04:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
questions say no other questions thank
 
04:07:27.750 --> 04:07:27.760 align:start position:0%

good afternoon Mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
for having me to be on the record on
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
this issue um my name is Ben Bradley I'm
 
04:07:55.990 --> 04:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
the vice president of state government
 
04:07:57.790 --> 04:07:57.800 align:start position:0%

Association we represent all the state's
 
04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Specialty hospitals acute
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
care hospitals and Specialty hospitals
 
04:08:06.990 --> 04:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns about s sp400 our
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals respond to medical records
 
04:08:11.550 --> 04:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
request in compliance with both the
 
04:08:12.990 --> 04:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
health insurance portability and
 
04:08:16.109 --> 04:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
accountability act Hippa and state law
 
04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
outlined in RSA
 
04:08:21.149 --> 04:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
332i uh one of the tenants of HIPPA is
 
04:08:22.830 --> 04:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
that every patient has the right to
 
04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
review and obtain a copy of their
 
04:08:27.269 --> 04:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
medical record we honor that Hippa
 
04:08:29.670 --> 04:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
establishes a patient rate for medical
 
04:08:31.550 --> 04:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
record requests made directly by
 
04:08:33.990 --> 04:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
patients which may include patients
 
04:08:35.550 --> 04:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
sending hospital records to their
 
04:08:37.469 --> 04:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
primary care provider or patients
 
04:08:39.309 --> 04:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
requesting run provider send their
 
04:08:41.910 --> 04:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
record to another one of their providers
 
04:08:44.189 --> 04:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
most of our Hospital members to provide
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
patients access to their medical records
 
04:08:49.229 --> 04:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
for free upon request the federal
 
04:08:51.870 --> 04:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
high-tech Act of 2009 updated the
 
04:08:54.189 --> 04:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
federal framework under Hippa creating a
 
04:08:56.790 --> 04:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
third-party directive for other parties
 
04:08:59.070 --> 04:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
to initiate medical records requests
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
with written authorization from
 
04:09:03.590 --> 04:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
Individual patients for records
 
04:09:05.710 --> 04:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
transmitted to third party such as law
 
04:09:08.149 --> 04:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
firms the patient rate established by
 
04:09:10.349 --> 04:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
Hippa does not apply federal law is
 
04:09:12.429 --> 04:09:12.439 align:start position:0%
silent on a fee structure for thirdparty
 
04:09:14.550 --> 04:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
requests which is where state law
 
04:09:17.309 --> 04:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
dictates the allowable cost for these
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
third party requests many of our
 
04:09:21.429 --> 04:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
hospitals including critical access
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals contract with a vendor which
 
04:09:25.550 --> 04:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
charges the third party request her
 
04:09:28.870 --> 04:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
directly Approximately 80% of providers
 
04:09:31.309 --> 04:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
nationally contract out medical record
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
copying services this process is Hippa
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
and state law compliant and frees the
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
hospital of managing the high volume of
 
04:09:41.309 --> 04:09:41.319 align:start position:0%
requests and the overhead cost and
 
04:09:43.109 --> 04:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
complexity of Performing the services
 
04:09:46.189 --> 04:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
that eles if they choose if the existing
 
04:09:48.910 --> 04:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
Contracting model is disrupted our
 
04:09:50.670 --> 04:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
members are concerned about having to
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
assume the work and cost of completing
 
04:09:54.630 --> 04:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
extensive medical records requests from
 
04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
third parties with very little
 
04:10:00.510 --> 04:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
compensation outlined in Sp sp400 that's
 
04:10:04.189 --> 04:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
$66.50 as passed by the Senate without
 
04:10:06.910 --> 04:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
access to a contracted vendor uh not
 
04:10:08.830 --> 04:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
that they would go out of business
 
04:10:10.349 --> 04:10:10.359 align:start position:0%
because they are large companies but
 
04:10:11.910 --> 04:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
that they may not choose to do business
 
04:10:13.469 --> 04:10:13.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or change their
 
04:10:15.790 --> 04:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
business model with hospitals in New
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire We Believe hospitals and
 
04:10:19.510 --> 04:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
providers would be forced to take on
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
this work estimated to cost $1 billion
 
04:10:25.710 --> 04:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
nationally on an annual basis finally
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
proponents of the bill question why a
 
04:10:28.830 --> 04:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's attorneys requests for
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
medical records on behalf of their
 
04:10:31.950 --> 04:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
client should be treated differently
 
04:10:34.349 --> 04:10:34.359 align:start position:0%
than the patient requesting the record
 
04:10:36.349 --> 04:10:36.359 align:start position:0%
themselves the committee should
 
04:10:37.750 --> 04:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
understand that although the attorney
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
may be acting on behalf of the patient
 
04:10:41.870 --> 04:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
in a legal case the attorney client
 
04:10:44.269 --> 04:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
privilege is not recognized the same as
 
04:10:46.750 --> 04:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
an appointed Guardian making Health Care
 
04:10:49.389 --> 04:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
decisions on behalf of a patient one
 
04:10:52.149 --> 04:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
other point I'd like to note um I think
 
04:10:54.030 --> 04:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
the parties that are concerned about
 
04:10:56.590 --> 04:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
with this proposal are willing to
 
04:11:00.269 --> 04:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
compromise you know having a $1,200
 
04:11:03.990 --> 04:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
request May certainly not be appropriate
 
04:11:07.309 --> 04:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
um but maybe there is a a means for
 
04:11:10.109 --> 04:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
looking into a cap that would be logical
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh for electronic copies paper copies I
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
think are a different scenario given
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
that the expense of the paper could
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
exceed whatever cap you end up putting
 
04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
forward um happy to take questions uh
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
but want to reiterate our concerns for
 
04:11:26.750 --> 04:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
how this bill was passed out of the
 
04:11:29.429 --> 04:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
Senate thank you questions from M
 
04:11:29.439 --> 04:11:32.469 align:start position:0%
Senate thank you questions from M
representative

04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:35.389 --> 04:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair so I
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly if I'm a
 
04:11:39.269 --> 04:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
patient I go to the hospital there's no
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
charge patient request is governed by
 
04:11:42.880 --> 04:11:43.990 align:start position:0%
charge patient request is governed by
Hippa

04:11:43.990 --> 04:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hippa
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
and that maximum would be $66.50 for a
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
patient request many of our hospitals
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
opt to provide that service for free if
 
04:11:56.429 --> 04:11:56.439 align:start position:0%
a patient requests themselves so the so
 
04:11:59.309 --> 04:11:59.319 align:start position:0%
if a patient then signs an affidavit for
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
somebody to do it on their
 
04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
behalf it's still the patient that's not
 
04:12:06.309 --> 04:12:06.319 align:start position:0%
the case and that's not how federal law
 
04:12:08.950 --> 04:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
recognizes that requests additionally I
 
04:12:11.149 --> 04:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
think there was an inquiry um recently
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
made I have some information um on uh
 
04:12:18.910 --> 04:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
from um plain's attorneys about uh these
 
04:12:20.870 --> 04:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
types of requests trying to clarify that
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
their request would be treated the same
 
04:12:25.469 --> 04:12:25.479 align:start position:0%
as a patient request and it's still not
 
04:12:25.479 --> 04:12:26.670 align:start position:0%
as a patient request and it's still not
the

04:12:26.670 --> 04:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
case so if I can follow up again follow
 
04:12:32.950 --> 04:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
up please thank you it says a patient's
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
personal representative which is in
 
04:12:37.469 --> 04:12:37.479 align:start position:0%
Hippa it's a federal that person get
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
charged so if I send my representative
 
04:12:42.389 --> 04:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
down because I can't get there I'm going
 
04:12:44.229 --> 04:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
to be charged
 
04:12:46.510 --> 04:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
um that's I would have to look into that
 
04:12:48.109 --> 04:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
I think your questions are legitimate
 
04:12:50.429 --> 04:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
about what a patient advocate is yeah
 
04:12:52.149 --> 04:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
and what how that is defined I don't
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that thank you sen
 
04:12:57.550 --> 04:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
mlan and then representative Weber thank
 
04:13:00.550 --> 04:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so I'm just trying to get a
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
a feel for the scope of this what
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
percentage of requests that the hospital
 
04:13:10.750 --> 04:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
Association gets are from the patient
 
04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
and what percentage would go to a third
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
party because they're from a
 
04:13:17.990 --> 04:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative or whatever thank you for
 
04:13:21.149 --> 04:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
the question representative M mlan um
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
first I just want to clarify that the
 
04:13:24.109 --> 04:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
association doesn't receive these
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
requests it would be our members that
 
04:13:27.229 --> 04:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
that get the requests I know that was
 
04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
the intent of your question just wanted
 
04:13:31.469 --> 04:13:31.479 align:start position:0%
to clarify um secondly I don't have
 
04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
information on the percentages of
 
04:13:36.030 --> 04:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
personal requests versus trial attorney
 
04:13:38.670 --> 04:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
or third party request
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
um but I'm happy to look into it and see
 
04:13:44.590 --> 04:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
if I can provide you an answer
 
04:13:46.830 --> 04:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
follow I mean that would just just to
 
04:13:48.389 --> 04:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
understand the magnitude of this thing
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
because obviously you're saying this is
 
04:13:53.910 --> 04:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
going to be a huge burden if you know if
 
04:13:56.830 --> 04:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
it's only 20% of the qu what's going on
 
04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
now then that would have a a bearing on
 
04:14:02.469 --> 04:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
the decision so well I just think um
 
04:14:04.269 --> 04:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
just for clarity some of our hospitals
 
04:14:06.870 --> 04:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
do not use a third party some do and
 
04:14:08.550 --> 04:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's part of I think what
 
04:14:10.269 --> 04:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
representative King was getting at which
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
was some are able to do that some are
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
not or some have chosen to use a
 
04:14:16.550 --> 04:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
different model to provide these
 
04:14:18.389 --> 04:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
services in compliance with HIPPA and
 
04:14:23.710 --> 04:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
state law so to the extent of the um uh
 
04:14:26.149 --> 04:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
numbers of or percentage of requests on
 
04:14:28.349 --> 04:14:28.359 align:start position:0%
behalf of third parties I would have to
 
04:14:32.269 --> 04:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
look into that but my testimony provides
 
04:14:33.950 --> 04:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh the point about several of our
 
04:14:36.630 --> 04:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals and uh including critical
 
04:14:38.790 --> 04:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
access hospitals use these vendors to do
 
04:14:40.670 --> 04:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
these services in compliance with HIPPA
 
04:14:43.389 --> 04:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
and and state law
 
04:14:43.399 --> 04:14:44.510 align:start position:0%
and and state law
representative

04:14:44.510 --> 04:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:14:47.950 --> 04:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you so now I have a bunch of
 
04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
04:14:55.389 --> 04:14:55.399 align:start position:0%
how things operate now okay and so if if
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
I walked into the hospital and said I'd
 
04:15:01.950 --> 04:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
like a copy of my records please M um
 
04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
and they chose to charge they would
 
04:15:06.149 --> 04:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
charge me 650 and they'd hand me a thumb
 
04:15:08.750 --> 04:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
drive or whatever I believe that we have
 
04:15:11.269 --> 04:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
30 days to respond I don't believe that
 
04:15:12.750 --> 04:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
we would get it to you right away but
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes conceptually yes okay so that that
 
04:15:17.550 --> 04:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
answers my first question yeah it would
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
be the 30 days uh so if somebody is
 
04:15:26.349 --> 04:15:26.359 align:start position:0%
unable physically to come and pick up
 
04:15:29.149 --> 04:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
that drive when it's available at the
 
04:15:30.790 --> 04:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
end of the 30
 
04:15:33.550 --> 04:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
days because the patient requested it
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
they still would not be charged is that
 
04:15:39.309 --> 04:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
correct or my I'd have to get back to
 
04:15:41.590 --> 04:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
you to to understand how that works I
 
04:15:43.590 --> 04:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
think representative Leon forth some
 
04:15:46.030 --> 04:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions about who applies as an
 
04:15:49.030 --> 04:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
advocate or who applies as as whatever
 
04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
else um and as far as I know the
 
04:15:56.590 --> 04:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
hospital would uh attempt to uh comply
 
04:15:58.349 --> 04:15:58.359 align:start position:0%
with getting them that
 
04:16:04.630 --> 04:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:07.630 --> 04:16:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh it would be very helpful if you could
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
as a followup to representative Leon's
 
04:16:11.469 --> 04:16:11.479 align:start position:0%
question because I think we're operating
 
04:16:14.790 --> 04:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
in the same direction um what I really
 
04:16:18.070 --> 04:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
want to know and to understand is where
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
the lines are because you have the
 
04:16:21.199 --> 04:16:22.750 align:start position:0%
the lines are because you have the
patient

04:16:22.750 --> 04:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:16:26.429 --> 04:16:26.439 align:start position:0%
themselves you might have a patient who
 
04:16:28.349 --> 04:16:28.359 align:start position:0%
physically could
 
04:16:32.429 --> 04:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
not be at the hospital um and perhaps
 
04:16:34.710 --> 04:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
all of this could happen via the mail
 
04:16:36.910 --> 04:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
and and a written authorization and
 
04:16:41.070 --> 04:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
something mailed to them that's fine um
 
04:16:44.030 --> 04:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get at is
 
04:16:48.510 --> 04:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
um the provision in cases where the
 
04:16:51.870 --> 04:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
patient is not
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
able um to request because of incapacity
 
04:16:57.950 --> 04:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
or one form or another and then we've
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
got the personal representative after
 
04:17:03.429 --> 04:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
death which is something else again but
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
my the thing that is what I'm trying to
 
04:17:10.510 --> 04:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
understand and I realize it may be in
 
04:17:16.109 --> 04:17:16.119 align:start position:0%
Hippa not your not your fault is why if
 
04:17:19.149 --> 04:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
I can request something for
 
04:17:23.910 --> 04:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
myself um why I can't represent request
 
04:17:28.269 --> 04:17:28.279 align:start position:0%
it for myself and then hand it to my
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
attorney and why there's a difference if
 
04:17:32.990 --> 04:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
I am handing it to my attorney and
 
04:17:34.710 --> 04:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
asking it to be sent directly to my
 
04:17:36.990 --> 04:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
attorney right I think those are fair
 
04:17:39.750 --> 04:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions um and I think Hippa is a
 
04:17:43.469 --> 04:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
complicated structure at which um does
 
04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
determine and helps distinguish whether
 
04:17:48.429 --> 04:17:48.439 align:start position:0%
it's case law or or the federal law
 
04:17:52.109 --> 04:17:52.119 align:start position:0%
itself um what the distinction is so I'm
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have a specific answer for
 
04:17:56.389 --> 04:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
you now but I'm confident that there are
 
04:17:58.590 --> 04:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines and and regulations that do
 
04:18:01.870 --> 04:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
make specific reference to a personal
 
04:18:04.950 --> 04:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
request from a patient versus
 
04:18:08.269 --> 04:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
third-party requests um that's just some
 
04:18:09.910 --> 04:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
of the reading that I've done on this
 
04:18:12.349 --> 04:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
issue and heard about from the folks
 
04:18:15.630 --> 04:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
that represent thank you representative
 
04:18:18.790 --> 04:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair I'm looking
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
at the uh Hippa rule what it says here
 
04:18:26.030 --> 04:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
General Provisions that basically the
 
04:18:28.630 --> 04:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
rule requires covered entities to treat
 
04:18:30.389 --> 04:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
an individual personal representative as
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
the individual with respect to use and
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
disclosure of individual protected
 
04:18:34.750 --> 04:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
information as well as the patient's
 
04:18:37.550 --> 04:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
individual rights so if you have a
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
individual that has a personal
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative as far as Hipp the way I
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
i' like to hear something back from the
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
hospital association with that
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation that is considered the
 
04:18:50.670 --> 04:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
patient and I don't know that a personal
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative is inclusive of a third-
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
party requestor like an attorney I don't
 
04:18:57.389 --> 04:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that so the only
 
04:18:58.590 --> 04:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
thing we're debating at this point in
 
04:19:01.149 --> 04:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
time is the attorney I don't know the
 
04:19:03.149 --> 04:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
answer to that specifically but my
 
04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is there is a a
 
04:19:06.189 --> 04:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
distinction between a third- party
 
04:19:08.750 --> 04:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
request and a personal request maybe
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
there are others here who could help
 
04:19:15.149 --> 04:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:17.070 --> 04:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions thank you
 
04:19:17.080 --> 04:19:21.670 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions thank you
thank

04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.269 --> 04:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Moren
 
04:19:28.990 --> 04:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:31.389 --> 04:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
iOS you've asked for five minutes if you
 
04:19:38.189 --> 04:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:51.550 --> 04:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
could you push the button there you go
 
04:19:58.109 --> 04:19:58.119 align:start position:0%
that might help huh okay so my name is
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
Marin meny I'm a vice president with
 
04:20:03.030 --> 04:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
share Care Health Data Services a
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
release of information service provider
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
company we operate in New Hampshire and
 
04:20:12.750 --> 04:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
over 45 other states as well I'm all
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
also here representing our trade assoc
 
04:20:20.189 --> 04:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
Association AOS um and that is
 
04:20:21.910 --> 04:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
Association of health information
 
04:20:24.309 --> 04:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
Outsource Outsourcing
 
04:20:27.870 --> 04:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
Services um so we all operate in
 
04:20:32.149 --> 04:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
hospitals in clinics excuse me um and
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
today I thank you for letting me come
 
04:20:37.429 --> 04:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
here and talk about what we do and how
 
04:20:41.070 --> 04:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
we operate and deliver medical records
 
04:20:43.469 --> 04:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
um we work in many many Hospitals and
 
04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
Clinics in New Hampshire and Beyond
 
04:20:47.590 --> 04:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
passing this bill would be a major
 
04:20:50.590 --> 04:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
change to our industry and transfer the
 
04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
cost from thirdparty
 
04:20:54.790 --> 04:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
requesters um and putting that cost onto
 
04:20:57.109 --> 04:20:57.119 align:start position:0%
the Health Care
 
04:21:00.429 --> 04:21:00.439 align:start position:0%
Systems um the type this type of Bill
 
04:21:01.990 --> 04:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
illustrates that we need a little bit
 
04:21:03.790 --> 04:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
more understanding of what's happening
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
out there with releasing information um
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
to requesters the process um that is out
 
04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
there and it has been talked about today
 
04:21:17.229 --> 04:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
is that this is nothing more than a push
 
04:21:20.109 --> 04:21:20.119 align:start position:0%
of a button and that is not the way we
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
operate releasing medical records is so
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
much more than that anyone could push a
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
button and release records but when you
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
do that when you're taking a a patient's
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
health information their personal health
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
information and releasing it you need to
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's compliant and that
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
it's getting um reviewed and we review
 
04:21:44.109 --> 04:21:44.119 align:start position:0%
it multiple times before we ever release
 
04:21:47.710 --> 04:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
anything so we we just want to make sure
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
that you understand the practice that
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
goes along with this um the steps that
 
04:21:57.870 --> 04:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
are involved are uh actually done by
 
04:22:00.750 --> 04:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
highly trained uh Specialists who
 
04:22:02.189 --> 04:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
understand the changing rules that
 
04:22:04.109 --> 04:22:04.119 align:start position:0%
govern patient
 
04:22:07.750 --> 04:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
releasing um we follow the Hippa rules
 
04:22:10.349 --> 04:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
the health insurance portability and
 
04:22:14.229 --> 04:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
accountability act and um and numerous
 
04:22:17.469 --> 04:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
other state and federal statutes set
 
04:22:19.389 --> 04:22:19.399 align:start position:0%
setting the cost for electronic records
 
04:22:21.309 --> 04:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
at 650 would require that the
 
04:22:24.109 --> 04:22:24.119 align:start position:0%
Fulfillment for each of these records be
 
04:22:26.030 --> 04:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
done at a loss for either the health
 
04:22:29.590 --> 04:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
care provider or an Roi vendor such as
 
04:22:32.670 --> 04:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
share care the cost to comply with
 
04:22:34.269 --> 04:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
federal and state rules that govern
 
04:22:36.750 --> 04:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
release of information is significant
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
and we've already acknowledged by um
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
several speakers that there's a cost to
 
04:22:45.189 --> 04:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
this and someone has to Bear the burden
 
04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
of that cost and to pass that along by
 
04:22:51.070 --> 04:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
changing the statute passing this along
 
04:22:53.149 --> 04:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
to the Health Care Facilities the
 
04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
clinics the providers that would be a
 
04:22:59.229 --> 04:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
significant burden to them there are
 
04:23:02.429 --> 04:23:02.439 align:start position:0%
different types of requesters as we know
 
04:23:06.030 --> 04:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
um medical you know there's release of
 
04:23:08.429 --> 04:23:08.439 align:start position:0%
information for attorneys insurance
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
companies um patients and as we've
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
already discussed a couple times hipper
 
04:23:17.710 --> 04:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
governs What patients can be charged
 
04:23:20.149 --> 04:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
most patients receive their records for
 
04:23:23.149 --> 04:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
free or at that cost-based fee that was
 
04:23:26.189 --> 04:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
already spoken about so minimal cost so
 
04:23:29.670 --> 04:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
we know this isn't about the patience
 
04:23:32.550 --> 04:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
this is about third-party requesters
 
04:23:34.109 --> 04:23:34.119 align:start position:0%
getting their records so there's a
 
04:23:36.309 --> 04:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
difference please start wrapping up oh
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay um so I just wanted to to make sure
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
that we understand that when we're
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
releasing uh companies such as share
 
04:23:49.710 --> 04:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
care or the other members of heos are
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
releasing information there is a process
 
04:23:54.870 --> 04:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're following all the Hippa guidelines
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
which there are many we have to have
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
those trained and certified people to
 
04:24:02.109 --> 04:24:02.119 align:start position:0%
release those records and um we're
 
04:24:04.189 --> 04:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
following everything to the te we're
 
04:24:06.070 --> 04:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
making sure if there's sensitive
 
04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
information that those records are
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
signed off appropriately so there's it's
 
04:24:14.109 --> 04:24:14.119 align:start position:0%
it's really truly not about just pushing
 
04:24:16.469 --> 04:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
a button but even more to just talk
 
04:24:19.590 --> 04:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
about the fees uh to cap this the
 
04:24:21.429 --> 04:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
electronic copy at
 
04:24:24.750 --> 04:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
650 would be a loss for us as I already
 
04:24:28.590 --> 04:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
discussed and capping the paper um at
 
04:24:32.269 --> 04:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
$50 would be a huge loss I just want to
 
04:24:35.550 --> 04:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
really quickly uh share one of our other
 
04:24:37.950 --> 04:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
companies that we're in the association
 
04:24:40.229 --> 04:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
with there was a patient record that was
 
04:24:44.229 --> 04:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
240,000 pages and it was required to be
 
04:24:47.670 --> 04:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
printed that is 48 cases of paper at a
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
material cost of over 2,000 alone never
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
mind the shipping cost for 2400 pounds
 
04:24:53.600 --> 04:24:54.550 align:start position:0%
mind the shipping cost for 2400 pounds
of

04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:24:56.830 --> 04:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
paper had this occurred with the
 
04:24:59.070 --> 04:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
proposed bill in place the cost for the
 
04:25:00.630 --> 04:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
hospital would have been in the
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
thousands capping the cost of printed
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
paper will drive requesters to request
 
04:25:09.189 --> 04:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
records more on paper because they know
 
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
they'll get it for a flat $50 so
 
04:25:16.510 --> 04:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
we just we know there's a cost we know I
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
I just want to level set and I'll wrap
 
04:25:22.269 --> 04:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
um this I feel like this is being
 
04:25:25.590 --> 04:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
portrayed potentially as this is a money
 
04:25:28.750 --> 04:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
grab for vendors it is not every single
 
04:25:31.229 --> 04:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
request we get there's a patient behind
 
04:25:33.469 --> 04:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
every request every
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
single release that comes in third party
 
04:25:38.990 --> 04:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
patients patients we already discussed
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
Hippa governs what they get charged so
 
04:25:43.229 --> 04:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
they get their records free there's
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
portals that they can go to all the
 
04:25:47.830 --> 04:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
patients can go to their Hospital their
 
04:25:50.269 --> 04:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
practices go on the portal and get their
 
04:25:53.349 --> 04:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
records so that's that's a big push that
 
04:25:56.070 --> 04:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's making nowadays but to limit
 
04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
the the charges us delivering records
 
04:26:02.670 --> 04:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
for 650 capping that some we're not
 
04:26:05.710 --> 04:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
going to we're in business I I heard you
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
know it was talked about earlier we're
 
04:26:10.469 --> 04:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
for profit I I I think we get the
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
message okay thank you representative
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
Seth King thank you thank you Mr chair
 
04:26:19.710 --> 04:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
you taking questions I am thank you
 
04:26:23.950 --> 04:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
um if a patient let's say goes to a
 
04:26:26.030 --> 04:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
hospital they go to their general
 
04:26:27.870 --> 04:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
practitioner they go to a specialist
 
04:26:30.030 --> 04:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
here they go to 10 different
 
04:26:32.910 --> 04:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
places um and they want to get their
 
04:26:35.830 --> 04:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
records for all of them can they get
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
them by just requesting it at their
 
04:26:40.149 --> 04:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
hospital or do they have to make a
 
04:26:41.870 --> 04:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
request at every single place they've
 
04:26:44.670 --> 04:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
been to too and that's a good question
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
um and that's governed by each covered
 
04:26:50.349 --> 04:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
entity if if they have visited 10
 
04:26:52.670 --> 04:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
different facilities they're not all in
 
04:26:54.870 --> 04:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
the same network then they potentially
 
04:26:57.109 --> 04:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
would have to request those records at
 
04:26:59.550 --> 04:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
each of the facilities so they could do
 
04:27:02.070 --> 04:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
that they don't necessarily have to do
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
you know do that um by sending in a
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
request they can actually call there's
 
04:27:08.750 --> 04:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
portals that they can go on and request
 
04:27:10.429 --> 04:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
their records there's all different ways
 
04:27:13.750 --> 04:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
for them to easily request their records
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
followup follow up um does share care
 
04:27:20.030 --> 04:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
not have all of those records how does
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
what what what what do what role does
 
04:27:25.149 --> 04:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
share care play in that so we have in
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have um and all across
 
04:27:30.269 --> 04:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
the country we have certain customers
 
04:27:32.750 --> 04:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
that we work with so that that what that
 
04:27:35.590 --> 04:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
means is we have access to their records
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
and we if we get a request from Dr
 
04:27:41.790 --> 04:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
Jones's office as long as we have access
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
to those records we would receive that
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
request and we would um deliver that
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
according to how the patient asked it to
 
04:27:51.950 --> 04:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
be delivered um there's electronic
 
04:27:53.710 --> 04:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
delivery there's paper you know there's
 
04:27:55.710 --> 04:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
all different ways email password
 
04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
protected and encrypted um so if we have
 
04:28:03.070 --> 04:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
if we're partnered with that facility
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
then we would release the record but we
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
would have to be partnered with them
 
04:28:09.910 --> 04:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
some there are other vendors in the
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
association that I mentioned um
 
04:28:15.790 --> 04:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
that have other New Hampshire facilities
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
and so if they got a request at that
 
04:28:20.349 --> 04:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
facility that other vendor would
 
04:28:23.070 --> 04:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
complete it one final followup follow up
 
04:28:25.990 --> 04:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
and if they go to Dr Jones and Dr Jones
 
04:28:28.910 --> 04:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
works with you um and they want their
 
04:28:31.309 --> 04:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
files but you also have a relationship
 
04:28:34.149 --> 04:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
with Dr Smith and so does the patient
 
04:28:36.189 --> 04:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
would you also be able to give them the
 
04:28:38.710 --> 04:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
records that they have with Dr Smith as
 
04:28:40.870 --> 04:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
well or would you be relegated to only
 
04:28:44.070 --> 04:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
helping them with the Dr Jones visit
 
04:28:45.550 --> 04:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
that's a great question it really
 
04:28:48.070 --> 04:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
depends on how they um fill out their
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
authorization if they say Dr Jones
 
04:28:53.510 --> 04:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
specifically that's all we can release
 
04:28:57.990 --> 04:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
unless there there are some um things
 
04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
that would could change that if the
 
04:29:02.269 --> 04:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
organization decides if you know they
 
04:29:04.469 --> 04:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
request Dr Jones but Dr Jones and Dr
 
04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
Smith work you know work closely on the
 
04:29:08.950 --> 04:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
patient then we could release that if
 
04:29:11.109 --> 04:29:11.119 align:start position:0%
that's the rule of the facility if
 
04:29:13.149 --> 04:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
that's the providers
 
04:29:16.269 --> 04:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
rule policy we could do that but
 
04:29:18.670 --> 04:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
specifically it would be better if they
 
04:29:21.070 --> 04:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
said Dr Jones and Dr Smith's records and
 
04:29:23.229 --> 04:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
then we would send both thank you
 
04:29:25.189 --> 04:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
04:29:28.590 --> 04:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here um
 
04:29:30.550 --> 04:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
I'm still trying to get a grasp on why
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
if my medical record is my property why
 
04:29:35.830 --> 04:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
it needs to go through a whole system
 
04:29:37.710 --> 04:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
and some sort of scrubbing or other
 
04:29:39.389 --> 04:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
process before it's given to somebody
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
that I've asked to request my record
 
04:29:44.550 --> 04:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to trying to understand
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
the point and the value in the system
 
04:29:48.149 --> 04:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
here so you're trying to understand the
 
04:29:50.590 --> 04:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
process that I you know has been talked
 
04:29:53.269 --> 04:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
about what when we receive that request
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
we take that our team takes that request
 
04:29:58.269 --> 04:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
they gather what's been authorized and
 
04:29:59.910 --> 04:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
they're going through that record to
 
04:30:01.630 --> 04:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
make sure there's nothing in there that
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
isn't compliant or if there's something
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
in there that is compliant to get the
 
04:30:10.030 --> 04:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate sign off so my question is
 
04:30:12.389 --> 04:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
about something if it's my record and I
 
04:30:15.229 --> 04:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
have rights to my entire record why is
 
04:30:17.469 --> 04:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
not discl why is disclosing something to
 
04:30:19.349 --> 04:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
me or somebody that I've asked to
 
04:30:21.790 --> 04:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
provide the information to not compliant
 
04:30:23.710 --> 04:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it be compli only compliant to
 
04:30:25.349 --> 04:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
give my entire record if that's what I
 
04:30:28.510 --> 04:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
asked for absolutely we have to follow
 
04:30:31.830 --> 04:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
so maybe I didn't answer that question
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know the way that the direction you
 
04:30:37.830 --> 04:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
were wanting it to go um I wasn't
 
04:30:39.750 --> 04:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that so if you send a
 
04:30:42.389 --> 04:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
request in and say I want my record I
 
04:30:44.309 --> 04:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
want all my records or I want you know
 
04:30:46.510 --> 04:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
the last five years we'll send you those
 
04:30:48.630 --> 04:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
last five years we're still we're not
 
04:30:50.510 --> 04:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
going to keep them from you we're not
 
04:30:53.590 --> 04:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to um you know put up any barriers
 
04:30:56.070 --> 04:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
at all you're able to get your records
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
because to your point they're yours so
 
04:31:01.630 --> 04:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
we do have to release them and as far as
 
04:31:03.990 --> 04:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
share care goes we wouldn't stop you
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
from getting a record as long as
 
04:31:08.189 --> 04:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
everything you know your release is in
 
04:31:10.590 --> 04:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
place and you tell us what you need we
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
would deliver those records to you you
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
um so sorry if I follow up so if I say
 
04:31:20.149 --> 04:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
that I have attorney Jones and I want my
 
04:31:22.429 --> 04:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
entire record not based on what you
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
think is compliant but I want my entire
 
04:31:27.389 --> 04:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
record to go to attorney Jones is there
 
04:31:28.830 --> 04:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
gatekeeping there is there something
 
04:31:30.269 --> 04:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
that happens to my sorry I didn't mean
 
04:31:32.109 --> 04:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
to sorry it's been a long day I did not
 
04:31:33.389 --> 04:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
mean to use a triggering word like
 
04:31:35.469 --> 04:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
gatekeeping is there a process of what
 
04:31:37.550 --> 04:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
happens when I'm asking for it to go to
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
somebody that I've asked it to go
 
04:31:44.269 --> 04:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
to so if you ask us to send it to your
 
04:31:46.429 --> 04:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
attorney we will send it to your
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
attorney and we have with every single
 
04:31:51.670 --> 04:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
practice that we work with we have rules
 
04:31:53.830 --> 04:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
and regulations in place if you say send
 
04:31:57.149 --> 04:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
your send you know attorney Jones my
 
04:31:59.229 --> 04:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
records then we're going to send them to
 
04:32:03.590 --> 04:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
them but what what happens is when we
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
send them if it's for a trial attorney
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
when we're sending the record we're not
 
04:32:10.389 --> 04:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
certifying that so most trial attorneys
 
04:32:12.790 --> 04:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
want certified records so that's why
 
04:32:15.070 --> 04:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
they're requesting them on their own so
 
04:32:17.429 --> 04:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
that when we send those records out we
 
04:32:19.870 --> 04:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
certify them and get them ready you know
 
04:32:22.670 --> 04:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
for trial for them so one last followup
 
04:32:24.630 --> 04:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
that sense so is the distinction between
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
a certified record and just a a a basic
 
04:32:30.790 --> 04:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
record because I could understand a
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
value of a certified record that you
 
04:32:34.189 --> 04:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
would want to pay more for where you
 
04:32:35.710 --> 04:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
have a review process but I'm still
 
04:32:37.950 --> 04:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
trying to understand checking for
 
04:32:39.910 --> 04:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
compliance for my record that I have
 
04:32:42.550 --> 04:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
right ownership of yeah so if you're
 
04:32:45.109 --> 04:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
just asking us to send you send your
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
records to attorney Jones we're going to
 
04:32:51.870 --> 04:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
send those records to attorney Jones and
 
04:32:54.790 --> 04:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
um usually on the authorization it does
 
04:32:58.389 --> 04:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
ask a purpose of why you're sending them
 
04:33:00.309 --> 04:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
why you want them sent so if you were to
 
04:33:04.029 --> 04:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
check off um you know legal or whatever
 
04:33:06.590 --> 04:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
you check off that dictates if we're
 
04:33:08.709 --> 04:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
going to send those records for free to
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
that attorney or are we're going to
 
04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
build them do that make sense no but
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
I'll stop asking thank you
 
04:33:17.551 --> 04:33:17.561 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
04:33:17.561 --> 04:33:19.990 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
representative

04:33:19.990 --> 04:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you Mr chair and I I will
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
refrain from asking those questions
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
again because I don't understand it
 
04:33:30.510 --> 04:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
either but um let me get at the other
 
04:33:32.990 --> 04:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
end of these things which because it's
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
news to me that there are all these
 
04:33:38.470 --> 04:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
third-party companies accessing my
 
04:33:40.990 --> 04:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
records for period for purposes of
 
04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
sharing them with somebody
 
04:33:42.959 --> 04:33:45.349 align:start position:0%
sharing them with somebody
else

04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:33:49.869 --> 04:33:49.879 align:start position:0%
so am I right in thinking that the way
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
you access these records is you have
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
been contracted by the hospital or the
 
04:33:57.869 --> 04:33:57.879 align:start position:0%
doctor's office or something and as a
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
result of that contract which specifies
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
whatever limits they put on your access
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
to the records that that's how you
 
04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
access the records to begin with that's
 
04:34:11.109 --> 04:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
correct we have agreements in place with
 
04:34:13.310 --> 04:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
the covered ID entity the hospital the
 
04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
provider's office we sign a business
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
associate agreement so it gives us
 
04:34:22.470 --> 04:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
access to the records we act um at those
 
04:34:25.750 --> 04:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
facilities as if we were one of their
 
04:34:27.910 --> 04:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
staff so we're partnered with these
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
groups all the Contracting is in place
 
04:34:33.510 --> 04:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
um so we are able to access the records
 
04:34:35.949 --> 04:34:35.959 align:start position:0%
so I will try one one follow up and I'm
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
sorry you know clearly we're all pretty
 
04:34:40.390 --> 04:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
ignorant I'm certainly very ignorant
 
04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
about this so
 
04:34:44.269 --> 04:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that you would be
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
standing in the shoes of the medical
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
practice with all the obligations of the
 
04:34:50.551 --> 04:34:50.561 align:start position:0%
medical practice which they have then
 
04:34:52.750 --> 04:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
put around your
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
access uh do you understand why it's
 
04:34:58.990 --> 04:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
hard for us to wrap our heads around the
 
04:35:01.230 --> 04:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
concept that if you're standing in the
 
04:35:04.670 --> 04:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
medical practice's shoes that my
 
04:35:08.109 --> 04:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
attorney my personal representative or
 
04:35:10.349 --> 04:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
somebody not the personal representative
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
but that my attorney is isn't standing
 
04:35:15.551 --> 04:35:15.561 align:start position:0%
in my shoes when what I want is all of
 
04:35:19.789 --> 04:35:19.799 align:start position:0%
my medical records sent to my
 
04:35:21.910 --> 04:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
attorney um
 
04:35:25.470 --> 04:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
so we are acting on behalf of the
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
facility so we are acting as if you know
 
04:35:31.070 --> 04:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
we are one of their team so we're
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
releasing records we're releasing
 
04:35:35.230 --> 04:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
records based on what the authorization
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
says so we are sending records out based
 
04:35:42.551 --> 04:35:42.561 align:start position:0%
on if you want your records for medical
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
purposes if you want them for legal
 
04:35:46.869 --> 04:35:46.879 align:start position:0%
purposes if you want them just for
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
yourself um so our team is trained to
 
04:35:53.789 --> 04:35:53.799 align:start position:0%
know which Avenue to take to release
 
04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
those records does that answer your
 
04:35:59.949 --> 04:35:59.959 align:start position:0%
question it ansers my question yes
 
04:36:01.349 --> 04:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative Falt and then
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant um so I I guess
 
04:36:06.990 --> 04:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
following on some of the questions that
 
04:36:10.470 --> 04:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh came up a moment ago I want to see if
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
if I perhaps understand um why there is
 
04:36:16.990 --> 04:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
a need to review my medical records if
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
you're sending them to me um several
 
04:36:22.551 --> 04:36:22.561 align:start position:0%
years ago I pulled a credit report and
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh was a bit surprised to discover
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
accounts on my credit report that did
 
04:36:29.070 --> 04:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
not belong to me they actually belong to
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
my father who whose name is almost
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as my own so is that
 
04:36:38.949 --> 04:36:38.959 align:start position:0%
why the the process requires that
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
additional level of scrutiny yes exactly
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
so junior senior um you know what we do
 
04:36:48.510 --> 04:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
we release a medical record we go
 
04:36:51.510 --> 04:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
through each record because in your
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
record there could have been a misfile
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
and some other patients information
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
could be in your record and if we didn't
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
review that and go through every single
 
04:37:02.910 --> 04:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
page to make sure they're only your
 
04:37:06.269 --> 04:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
records then that would be a breach so
 
04:37:08.230 --> 04:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
you would receive a record that didn't
 
04:37:10.390 --> 04:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
belong to you another patient's record
 
04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:12.959 align:start position:0%
so there is a lot that goes into it and
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
I know it's your record and you you have
 
04:37:17.830 --> 04:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
access to and you have rights to it and
 
04:37:19.949 --> 04:37:19.959 align:start position:0%
we would never keep you from that but we
 
04:37:21.551 --> 04:37:21.561 align:start position:0%
want to make sure it's compliant before
 
04:37:25.150 --> 04:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
it goes out follow up okay um so the the
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
supporters of this this bill have argued
 
04:37:29.070 --> 04:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
that that medical record if my attorney
 
04:37:31.390 --> 04:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
is requesting it they it's my record I
 
04:37:35.230 --> 04:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
own it it's um but you've also talked
 
04:37:37.470 --> 04:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
about this distinction between
 
04:37:37.480 --> 04:37:39.189 align:start position:0%
about this distinction between
certified

04:37:39.189 --> 04:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
certified
 
04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
and so just CER so my my question is um
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
is is there additional cost associated
 
04:37:50.629 --> 04:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
with producing that certified record as
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to Simply sending me a
 
04:37:56.269 --> 04:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
record so directly okay so if you're
 
04:37:58.150 --> 04:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
asking for your record to go to your
 
04:38:01.390 --> 04:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
attorney and you've asked
 
04:38:04.510 --> 04:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
and we fulfilling that
 
04:38:07.629 --> 04:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
request there's a a section on the
 
04:38:10.349 --> 04:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
authorization that dictates is what's
 
04:38:13.629 --> 04:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
the purpose is there for legal is this
 
04:38:15.629 --> 04:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
you know what's the purpose of this
 
04:38:18.150 --> 04:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
authorization if you if the attorney
 
04:38:21.070 --> 04:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
sends in a request and says se you know
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
this patient would like their records
 
04:38:25.949 --> 04:38:25.959 align:start position:0%
and would like them certified for court
 
04:38:27.629 --> 04:38:27.639 align:start position:0%
then we would send them and certify them
 
04:38:31.310 --> 04:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
and there's the cost is that answer no
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
so the question is is there a difference
 
04:38:36.949 --> 04:38:36.959 align:start position:0%
in cost there's a difference in cost um
 
04:38:41.150 --> 04:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
for the so we certify the record by the
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
PID there isn't a charge for the
 
04:38:46.869 --> 04:38:46.879 align:start position:0%
certification but in order for it to go
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
to the attorney with the certification
 
04:38:54.269 --> 04:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
attached we would charge for
 
04:38:57.230 --> 04:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
that representative Merchant then
 
04:38:57.240 --> 04:39:00.590 align:start position:0%
that representative Merchant then
representative

04:39:00.590 --> 04:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:02.629 --> 04:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr
 
04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
chair going back to the question about
 
04:39:06.429 --> 04:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
the patients personal
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
representative it sounds like where the
 
04:39:12.830 --> 04:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
tension is is
 
04:39:15.750 --> 04:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
between what you refer to I guess as an
 
04:39:17.709 --> 04:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
third party which should be considered
 
04:39:17.719 --> 04:39:18.670 align:start position:0%
third party which should be considered
an

04:39:18.670 --> 04:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:39:21.670 --> 04:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
authorized an IND individual authorized
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
access the medical records to the power
 
04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
of attorney or the patient's attorney is
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
that where the where the tension is I'm
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
sorry could you repeat that if I look at
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
what's here for releasing records MH it
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
says a requestor could be a patient you
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay with that yeah patient's personal
 
04:39:42.910 --> 04:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
representative you okay with that yeah
 
04:39:44.670 --> 04:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
the individual authorized to access
 
04:39:46.350 --> 04:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
patient medical records through valid
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
power of attorney are you okay with that
 
04:39:52.030 --> 04:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
yes so what about the patient's
 
04:39:54.390 --> 04:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
attorney So the patient's attorney I
 
04:39:57.190 --> 04:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
guess it depends on what the purpose is
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
and you know what I can take that
 
04:40:01.470 --> 04:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
offline and get some more definition
 
04:40:03.270 --> 04:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
around that question because we keep
 
04:40:06.470 --> 04:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
coming back to that area we've we've had
 
04:40:08.430 --> 04:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
that question a couple of times so let
 
04:40:11.788 --> 04:40:11.798 align:start position:0%
me follow up and we'll get you more find
 
04:40:15.990 --> 04:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
information on that rather than um you
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
know I want to get to the um experts and
 
04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
get them to weigh in on this and we'll
 
04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
get that back to you if I can Mr chair I
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
want I want to be clear right now that
 
04:40:31.150 --> 04:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
from share Care's point of view yes if
 
04:40:33.030 --> 04:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's the patient requesting it you're
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay with it correct if it's the
 
04:40:37.708 --> 04:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
patient's personal representative you're
 
04:40:39.948 --> 04:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
okay with that that's correct and if
 
04:40:43.110 --> 04:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's an indiv idual I I authorize with a
 
04:40:45.910 --> 04:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
power of attorney are you okay with that
 
04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
yes those are Hipp of guidance so the
 
04:40:49.628 --> 04:40:49.638 align:start position:0%
only thing right now is he's going to
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
get back to us is the word patience
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
attorney and how we Define that correct
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mlan and then
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Paz off thank you Mr
 
04:41:01.830 --> 04:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
chair and I have three just very rapid
 
04:41:05.230 --> 04:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
fire questions short answer hopefully um
 
04:41:08.070 --> 04:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
so just from my understanding you go
 
04:41:10.150 --> 04:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
through all these steps so there's a
 
04:41:13.030 --> 04:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
there's a a a a workflow that you have
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
when you go through that's right is
 
04:41:18.150 --> 04:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
there anything in your workflow that is
 
04:41:21.190 --> 04:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
different than the workflow at Basque
 
04:41:24.150 --> 04:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
Imaging or Dartmouth Hitchcock is there
 
04:41:26.750 --> 04:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
anything that you do over and above what
 
04:41:29.750 --> 04:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
they do I don't know the answer to that
 
04:41:31.590 --> 04:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
I know what we do I'm not sure what
 
04:41:33.550 --> 04:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
their process is what their workflows
 
04:41:37.510 --> 04:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
are um I I could share what we do well
 
04:41:40.110 --> 04:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
no I I think I'm really just trying to
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
understand the differentiation
 
04:41:41.878 --> 04:41:43.270 align:start position:0%
understand the differentiation
um

04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:46.750 --> 04:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
because my next question would just be
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
if if the workflow was identical um is
 
04:41:53.230 --> 04:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
it the case then that Bas and Dartmouth
 
04:41:55.030 --> 04:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock and these Community Hospitals
 
04:41:58.550 --> 04:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
for each request are operating at a loss
 
04:42:01.150 --> 04:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
are you aware um in your discussions
 
04:42:04.708 --> 04:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
with them I don't know that okay no then
 
04:42:06.830 --> 04:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
I I will just ask one final question
 
04:42:08.510 --> 04:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
which I sort of asked the folks at the
 
04:42:10.270 --> 04:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
hospital Association and maybe you have
 
04:42:14.830 --> 04:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
an answer for what is the percentage of
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
requests that you know you and companies
 
04:42:20.990 --> 04:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
like you fulfill is it you know you're
 
04:42:23.910 --> 04:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
fulfilling 80% of the requests 20% of
 
04:42:26.708 --> 04:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
the requests do you have a feel for that
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
so what type of
 
04:42:30.868 --> 04:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
requesters no I'm saying of all the
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
requests for medical records that are
 
04:42:36.190 --> 04:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
submitted from all sources um you know
 
04:42:38.190 --> 04:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
because ultimately it all goes to the
 
04:42:39.670 --> 04:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
initial provider and then they're going
 
04:42:41.708 --> 04:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
to contract out to you right
 
04:42:45.030 --> 04:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
what is the percentage of the requests
 
04:42:47.470 --> 04:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
that are fulfilled by you and
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
organizations like you versus those that
 
04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
are filled by Basque Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
04:42:55.510 --> 04:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
and people like that so for all of our
 
04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
customers and we have 10,000 customers
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
across the 47 States we're in when we're
 
04:43:04.550 --> 04:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
contracted with a covered entity we do
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
process all of their requests that come
 
04:43:08.948 --> 04:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
in so anything that came in would come
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
to us 42%
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
of those requests are third party
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
requests 4% yes thank yeah
 
04:43:19.830 --> 04:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative P off and then
 
04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative TZ thank you um thank you
 
04:43:27.310 --> 04:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is sh care 100%
 
04:43:30.190 --> 04:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
digital or if not what share of your
 
04:43:33.868 --> 04:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
record keeping is not in electronic
 
04:43:36.550 --> 04:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
format so we keep everything
 
04:43:38.590 --> 04:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
electronically when we're working with
 
04:43:40.430 --> 04:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
our different covered entities the
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
different hospital and practices we
 
04:43:45.628 --> 04:43:45.638 align:start position:0%
actually it depends on what they have
 
04:43:47.788 --> 04:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
some of them have EMR some are still on
 
04:43:50.510 --> 04:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
paper some are fees we grab all of that
 
04:43:53.470 --> 04:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
but we house everything that we process
 
04:43:57.550 --> 04:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
digitally follow up and then in example
 
04:44:01.990 --> 04:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
of uh expensive 48 cases of paper is it
 
04:44:05.110 --> 04:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
your understanding that those 48 cases
 
04:44:09.510 --> 04:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
of documents did not exist
 
04:44:12.110 --> 04:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
electronically did did not exist I'm
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
sorry uh in electronic format they did
 
04:44:18.390 --> 04:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
not they those were paper records that's
 
04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
so there was no whatever record set that
 
04:44:24.750 --> 04:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
was whatever dates of service that were
 
04:44:29.788 --> 04:44:29.798 align:start position:0%
requested for that 240,000 page record
 
04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
that was all in paper they were not
 
04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
available in electronic format in an EMR
 
04:44:38.270 --> 04:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
TZ thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um I also was not
 
04:44:46.868 --> 04:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
aware that this is a industry um that
 
04:44:48.350 --> 04:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
there is such a thing as release of
 
04:44:50.470 --> 04:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
information service providers but
 
04:44:54.150 --> 04:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
clearly there's a business need um and I
 
04:44:56.990 --> 04:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
can only speak from my own perspective
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
as a family doc um when I was practicing
 
04:45:02.270 --> 04:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
I know that if I wanted to print
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
something like any little thing you do
 
04:45:07.230 --> 04:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
you go in and print that one thing so
 
04:45:10.070 --> 04:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
one Clinic Note One lab report it's not
 
04:45:12.030 --> 04:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
like you just push one button you get
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
everything so it it is really burdensome
 
04:45:16.270 --> 04:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing was I wasn't supposed to
 
04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
do it right for my own patients I was
 
04:45:20.590 --> 04:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to send them to medical records
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
and they figure that has partly to do
 
04:45:24.788 --> 04:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
with like that way we know who we've
 
04:45:26.788 --> 04:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
released information to and they've
 
04:45:29.150 --> 04:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
everyone has signed off who needs to
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
sign off so I think um I appreciate you
 
04:45:34.590 --> 04:45:34.600 align:start position:0%
trying to explain it all to us because
 
04:45:38.470 --> 04:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
it it is a little bit um complicated and
 
04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
so again trying to sort out what's this
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
difference between um what the
 
04:45:45.190 --> 04:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
organizations themselves could be doing
 
04:45:47.350 --> 04:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
versus you and you just clarified that
 
04:45:49.750 --> 04:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
people contract with you to take care of
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
all of it correct so it's people aren't
 
04:45:54.788 --> 04:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
going to their own medical record you
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
know downstairs in the basement uh
 
04:45:59.270 --> 04:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
office anymore like they were right and
 
04:46:01.030 --> 04:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
the practices in the clinics and the
 
04:46:03.788 --> 04:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals don't have the staff nowadays
 
04:46:05.910 --> 04:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
and they're not as well trained and well
 
04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
versed in the hippo regulations and the
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
releasing so a company like a share care
 
04:46:14.788 --> 04:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
are the members of a heos um our teams
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
are all specialized trained to do this
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
work and release the records thank you
 
04:46:21.360 --> 04:46:22.670 align:start position:0%
work and release the records thank you
representative

04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:46:25.470 --> 04:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
kofalt um thank you and so I'm going to
 
04:46:27.628 --> 04:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
try to be clearer in the way I asked the
 
04:46:30.350 --> 04:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
question y um I'm trying to understand
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
if the cost not the not the price you
 
04:46:35.270 --> 04:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
charge but the
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
cost of processing a record that is
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
certified for an attorney
 
04:46:44.190 --> 04:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
is higher than the cost of delivering
 
04:46:46.270 --> 04:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
the same record to the patient in other
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
words yes is it 10 hours to deliver the
 
04:46:50.390 --> 04:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
patient record to the
 
04:46:53.190 --> 04:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
patient and 100 hours to deliver it as a
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
certified or is it you know 10 hours in
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
one minute to to deliver it as a
 
04:47:00.150 --> 04:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
certified copy to the attorney I'm
 
04:47:03.150 --> 04:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
trying to understand does it cost you
 
04:47:06.548 --> 04:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
something extra to certify that record
 
04:47:09.868 --> 04:47:09.878 align:start position:0%
and if so what's the ballpark is it is
 
04:47:13.750 --> 04:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
it 1% is it 50% more what's what's the
 
04:47:17.670 --> 04:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
additional cost yeah and I I I would
 
04:47:21.270 --> 04:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
like to actually add that to um some of
 
04:47:23.110 --> 04:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
the research that we'll do to bring that
 
04:47:26.670 --> 04:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
back to you so we can Define um what you
 
04:47:28.750 --> 04:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
know and have it in writing for you
 
04:47:30.910 --> 04:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what the difference is to
 
04:47:33.868 --> 04:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
explain it so there's no gray area why
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
if a patient requests it um and why if
 
04:47:40.510 --> 04:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
an attorney requests it what that looks
 
04:47:42.910 --> 04:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
like but I will get that back to the
 
04:47:45.670 --> 04:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh in writing so you have it
 
04:47:48.548 --> 04:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
so that you understand what both you
 
04:47:52.270 --> 04:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
know request what that means to both and
 
04:47:54.548 --> 04:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
the pricing representative Merchant I'll
 
04:47:56.708 --> 04:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
try to make the last question thank you
 
04:47:59.788 --> 04:47:59.798 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman following up on represent
 
04:48:02.628 --> 04:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
Cal's question is there a cost
 
04:48:05.110 --> 04:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
differential if you have the I would
 
04:48:07.548 --> 04:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
assume that within the organization as a
 
04:48:09.910 --> 04:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
service provider most of your records
 
04:48:11.548 --> 04:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
are electronic I can't imagine you
 
04:48:14.350 --> 04:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
having rooms and rooms filled with paper
 
04:48:17.310 --> 04:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
so are the files that you have on behalf
 
04:48:19.110 --> 04:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
of the patient are they really
 
04:48:21.310 --> 04:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
electronic format and if somebody wants
 
04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
then request it or you telling me or
 
04:48:25.830 --> 04:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that you literally have
 
04:48:29.390 --> 04:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
volumes of paper sitting around so it
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
really depends on the covered entity so
 
04:48:34.868 --> 04:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
everyone is different um that scenario
 
04:48:37.470 --> 04:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
that I gave you uh about the 240,000
 
04:48:40.030 --> 04:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
pages that was all paper but there was
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
an EMR
 
04:48:43.628 --> 04:48:43.638 align:start position:0%
um component to that but it didn't fall
 
04:48:46.590 --> 04:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
into the scope of the the paper records
 
04:48:48.390 --> 04:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
that they wanted released but some of
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
our customers have two and three
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
different EMR systems they have paper
 
04:48:55.628 --> 04:48:55.638 align:start position:0%
they have microfilm they have F and we
 
04:48:57.868 --> 04:48:57.878 align:start position:0%
have to go through all of those
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
different scenarios to pull records
 
04:49:02.590 --> 04:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
either from the emrs take the paper
 
04:49:06.190 --> 04:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
chart and scan that excuse scan it and
 
04:49:08.788 --> 04:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
then print the feat so it really depends
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
on the covered entity that we're working
 
04:49:13.670 --> 04:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
at um there are some that just only have
 
04:49:15.390 --> 04:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
EMR and that's a whole different ball
 
04:49:17.590 --> 04:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
game but there are some that have the
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
paper the feish the three emrs um so it
 
04:49:23.830 --> 04:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
really just depends on where we are
 
04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
responding to a request follow that help
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that helps me immensely
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
so if it's a electronic
 
04:49:36.030 --> 04:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
format through electronic medical record
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes there's probably minimal cost to
 
04:49:41.470 --> 04:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
take that record and send it some
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
because it's all electronic unless it's
 
04:49:48.708 --> 04:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
certified um yeah and and so there's
 
04:49:51.628 --> 04:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
just because the record is in the EMR
 
04:49:54.430 --> 04:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
and it's uh you know we're going through
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
and pulling we're pulling the records
 
04:49:58.868 --> 04:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
out of the EMR into our system because
 
04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
the hospital systems don't have the
 
04:50:03.548 --> 04:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
delivery mechanisms that we do to
 
04:50:06.190 --> 04:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
release these records to the requesters
 
04:50:08.628 --> 04:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
so we're pulling the records out of the
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
EMR but we're still going through that
 
04:50:13.788 --> 04:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
same process we're going to make sure go
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
through every page it doesn't matter
 
04:50:18.350 --> 04:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
what size the chart is five pages or
 
04:50:21.230 --> 04:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
5,000 we're looking at every single page
 
04:50:23.548 --> 04:50:23.558 align:start position:0%
and making sure there's no junior senior
 
04:50:26.708 --> 04:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
records so the the steps are all the
 
04:50:28.868 --> 04:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
same whether it's an electronic record
 
04:50:30.750 --> 04:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
or it's paper or it's
 
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
film does that
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
answer it it it gets me in the right
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
direction okay thank you other
 
04:50:41.788 --> 04:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no done thank you thank
 
04:50:46.948 --> 04:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
time also signed up to speak is Nick
 
04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
Abramson from
 
04:50:57.750 --> 04:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:59.910 --> 04:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon everyone thank
 
04:51:01.350 --> 04:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
you very much for your time I'll try to
 
04:51:04.150 --> 04:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
keep this this as brief as I can um my
 
04:51:06.270 --> 04:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
name is Nick Abramson I'm an attorney in
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire I'm part of the
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association for justice uh
 
04:51:12.390 --> 04:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
I worked down the street for many years
 
04:51:14.230 --> 04:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
at the US attorney's office as a federal
 
04:51:16.990 --> 04:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutor before seven and a half years
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
ago starting to represent victims of
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice that's my entire
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
case load at this point is I represent
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
people who have been harmed by medical
 
04:51:28.230 --> 04:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
negligence so this issue comes up for me
 
04:51:29.910 --> 04:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
every single day we are requesting
 
04:51:32.190 --> 04:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
records for clients every day we are
 
04:51:34.350 --> 04:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
getting bills for thousands of dollars
 
04:51:36.190 --> 04:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
on a weekly basis for these client
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
records and so this has an big impact on
 
04:51:41.990 --> 04:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
us it has a big impact on our ability to
 
04:51:44.030 --> 04:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
um investigate claims on behalf of New
 
04:51:45.830 --> 04:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens and it has a big
 
04:51:49.390 --> 04:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
impact on our clients so um I want to do
 
04:51:51.470 --> 04:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
two things very quickly one is talk to
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
you practically about what this looks
 
04:51:55.310 --> 04:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
like on the ground what we're doing and
 
04:51:57.390 --> 04:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in response to to
 
04:51:59.830 --> 04:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
these record requests um but first very
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
briefly I just want to rebut some of the
 
04:52:03.548 --> 04:52:03.558 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard from the past
 
04:52:06.030 --> 04:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
few Witnesses um I think representative
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
Lon and several others have your finger
 
04:52:11.548 --> 04:52:11.558 align:start position:0%
on the issue here which I think we're we
 
04:52:13.670 --> 04:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
lose the force for the trees a little
 
04:52:15.628 --> 04:52:15.638 align:start position:0%
bit here and we get into the details
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
about what these vendors do what Hippa
 
04:52:21.230 --> 04:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
says what all of these regulations say
 
04:52:23.548 --> 04:52:23.558 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that any patient can
 
04:52:25.548 --> 04:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
get their record for
 
04:52:27.830 --> 04:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
$66.50 but when I request it as their
 
04:52:30.070 --> 04:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'm getting charged
 
04:52:30.080 --> 04:52:32.030 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'm getting charged
$4,500

04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
$4,500
 
04:52:32.040 --> 04:52:34.230 align:start position:0%
$4,500
$1,800

04:52:34.230 --> 04:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
$1,800
 
04:52:36.990 --> 04:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
$900 really the critical question is
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
justification for charging a patient
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
lawyer a thousand times more than they
 
04:52:46.110 --> 04:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
charge the patient and I can tell you I
 
04:52:47.430 --> 04:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
feel like I'm banging my head against
 
04:52:50.270 --> 04:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
the wall in in a dozen meetings with
 
04:52:52.750 --> 04:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
these vendors I have not been able to
 
04:52:54.510 --> 04:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
get a straight answer about the
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
justification for that increased cost
 
04:52:59.590 --> 04:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
for the lawyer versus the patient and I
 
04:53:02.190 --> 04:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
will tell you that in one meeting that I
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
had with one of these thirdparty vendors
 
04:53:07.110 --> 04:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
it was told to me that if I as the
 
04:53:09.470 --> 04:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer asked for the full complete
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
unredacted record of the patient just
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
like the patient would ask for that
 
04:53:16.910 --> 04:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
there is no additional cost incurred so
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
in all of these communications all of
 
04:53:21.910 --> 04:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
these side meetings not a single time
 
04:53:25.470 --> 04:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
have I ever been provided with any basis
 
04:53:27.830 --> 04:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
or justifiable reason why a lawyer
 
04:53:30.510 --> 04:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
should be charged more than the patient
 
04:53:32.230 --> 04:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
and I also want to bring it back to this
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
we talk about uh potential burden on
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire on hospitals
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
on the hospital
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
Association every every patient can get
 
04:53:42.070 --> 04:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
it for
 
04:53:44.590 --> 04:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
$6.50 which means every one of my
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
clients could do that if I sent them to
 
04:53:49.150 --> 04:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
the hospital to get it it's going to be
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
the same burden on the hospitals whether
 
04:53:53.708 --> 04:53:53.718 align:start position:0%
the patients have to get it or I have to
 
04:53:55.628 --> 04:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
get it it's just whether we C we can
 
04:53:58.590 --> 04:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
justify this additional unnecessary cost
 
04:54:01.230 --> 04:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
for the attorneys and let me put it in
 
04:54:03.310 --> 04:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
perspective for you with one simple case
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm looking at right now a client
 
04:54:08.230 --> 04:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
approached us um we're looking at a
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
possible delayed diagnosis of sep
 
04:54:13.270 --> 04:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
following an operation um she went into
 
04:54:15.030 --> 04:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
septic shock she's lost all of her
 
04:54:17.350 --> 04:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
fingers and toes so this client is
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
coming to me asking me if if I can
 
04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
investigate whether she is a victim of
 
04:54:24.548 --> 04:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice now I have a choice
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
I can tell this woman who has no fingers
 
04:54:28.830 --> 04:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
and toes and is recovering from septic
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
shock to go to the hospital and get her
 
04:54:33.030 --> 04:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
records for
 
04:54:36.310 --> 04:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
$6.50 or I as her attorney can request
 
04:54:39.310 --> 04:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
those for her to save her that time and
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
effort uh and frankly she's unable to
 
04:54:43.390 --> 04:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
even sign an
 
04:54:46.548 --> 04:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
authorization um so of course I do that
 
04:54:48.548 --> 04:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
and the next thing I know I get a bill
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh from either sco or Sharecare for
 
04:54:53.788 --> 04:54:53.798 align:start position:0%
$4,500 and I think that's the perfect
 
04:54:56.230 --> 04:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
example of why this is such a critical
 
04:54:58.628 --> 04:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
issue that the people who are requesting
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
these records through their attorneys
 
04:55:02.190 --> 04:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
are doing so because they've been
 
04:55:04.350 --> 04:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
catastrophically injured they're going
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
through late diagnosed cancer
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
catastrophic injuries they are suffering
 
04:55:10.430 --> 04:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
and they need their lawyers to be be
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
able to do this and so I've heard the
 
04:55:15.390 --> 04:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
response many times well just send the
 
04:55:16.948 --> 04:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
client send your client into the
 
04:55:19.868 --> 04:55:19.878 align:start position:0%
hospital and they can get it for
 
04:55:23.230 --> 04:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
$66.50 why why can't I get that for them
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
for the same cost and I think that it
 
04:55:27.190 --> 04:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
all boils down to that if the vendors
 
04:55:32.070 --> 04:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
can provide some true justifiable basis
 
04:55:33.708 --> 04:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
that has evidence to back it up that
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
they are incurring substantial
 
04:55:37.750 --> 04:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
additional costs to get these records to
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
US versus our patients uh our clients
 
04:55:42.670 --> 04:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
and the patients will listen to that but
 
04:55:45.750 --> 04:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
nobody's provided that to us yet um so I
 
04:55:47.230 --> 04:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
know I've I've probably already gone
 
04:55:49.548 --> 04:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
over two minutes three over three now
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'll I'll keep the rest of this
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
really brief one other aspect I think
 
04:55:55.350 --> 04:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
that is important to consider which has
 
04:55:57.230 --> 04:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
to do with the the impact of the
 
04:55:59.590 --> 04:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
citizens in New Hampshire is that this
 
04:56:01.868 --> 04:56:01.878 align:start position:0%
process of overcharging lawyers for
 
04:56:04.670 --> 04:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
getting these records prices out a lot
 
04:56:06.270 --> 04:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire citizens from having
 
04:56:08.030 --> 04:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
their claims reviewed because we have
 
04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
people come to us where we're not sure
 
04:56:12.190 --> 04:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
if it's a claim or not we don't know it
 
04:56:14.670 --> 04:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
might be it might not be but if we have
 
04:56:17.788 --> 04:56:17.798 align:start position:0%
to pay $2,000 or $3,000 to get the
 
04:56:20.310 --> 04:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
records on behalf of that client it
 
04:56:22.548 --> 04:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
precludes us from conducting a free
 
04:56:24.270 --> 04:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
legal review for them to determine
 
04:56:26.430 --> 04:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
whether they have a claim or not so you
 
04:56:28.948 --> 04:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
may have people who have viable claims
 
04:56:30.310 --> 04:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
who have been injured by medical
 
04:56:31.708 --> 04:56:31.718 align:start position:0%
negligence or some other kind of
 
04:56:33.708 --> 04:56:33.718 align:start position:0%
negligence who are having their claims
 
04:56:35.430 --> 04:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
lost through the cracks because of these
 
04:56:38.030 --> 04:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary costs okay thank you the
 
04:56:40.230 --> 04:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
last point I'll make I I promise is just
 
04:56:42.030 --> 04:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
just very briefly practically what we're
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
seeing on the ground so we're getting
 
04:56:46.270 --> 04:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
these charges for requesting these
 
04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
records what we see routinely is uh
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
duplicative Records thousands of
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
duplicative pages and essentially an
 
04:56:56.548 --> 04:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
electronic shoe box full of disorganized
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
records this is not a curated uh perfect
 
04:57:01.628 --> 04:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
organized record that we're getting that
 
04:57:05.390 --> 04:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
would justify these costs of $2,000
 
04:57:09.230 --> 04:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
$4,000 it will be 3,800 Pages where
 
04:57:11.310 --> 04:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
there's maybe hundred original Pages the
 
04:57:13.788 --> 04:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
rest is disorganized duplicative records
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
that we're getting charged for we often
 
04:57:18.150 --> 04:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
don't get the complete record so we
 
04:57:19.990 --> 04:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
often have to make multiple requests to
 
04:57:22.190 --> 04:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
these vendors just to ensure that we're
 
04:57:24.230 --> 04:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
getting the complete record and what we
 
04:57:27.070 --> 04:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
find routinely in our cases is that we
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
will get an incomplete disorganized
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
record but the defense attorney on the
 
04:57:32.670 --> 04:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the case who's
 
04:57:34.868 --> 04:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
representing the hospital will have a
 
04:57:37.230 --> 04:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
perfect complete organized record where
 
04:57:39.390 --> 04:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
we're getting a completely disorganized
 
04:57:41.590 --> 04:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
record than thank you so representative
 
04:57:43.788 --> 04:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
Weber and then representative Seth
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
04:57:50.470 --> 04:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
question in the case of somebody who
 
04:57:52.230 --> 04:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
might have requested their own record
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then passed it on to
 
04:57:57.110 --> 04:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
you um would you as an attorney then
 
04:57:59.230 --> 04:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
have chain of custody problems if you
 
04:58:01.470 --> 04:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
tried to get it admitted to trial that's
 
04:58:03.270 --> 04:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
a really good question the answer is it
 
04:58:05.628 --> 04:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
depends so if they get the record
 
04:58:08.310 --> 04:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
certified um and it's a complete record
 
04:58:10.470 --> 04:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
we can use that but what we find mind
 
04:58:13.110 --> 04:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
that is the difficulty you know our
 
04:58:15.030 --> 04:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
clients and the patients run the gamut
 
04:58:16.830 --> 04:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of legal and medical
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
sophistication so some of them will get
 
04:58:21.270 --> 04:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
their records but they don't know how to
 
04:58:22.590 --> 04:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
get it so they'll only get a little
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
piece of it or they they will get a
 
04:58:26.470 --> 04:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
record that's not certified and so when
 
04:58:28.670 --> 04:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
we come to they come to us what we find
 
04:58:31.150 --> 04:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
inevitably is that they'll say I have my
 
04:58:33.910 --> 04:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
records but they have maybe 5% of what
 
04:58:36.510 --> 04:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
we actually need and so to make things
 
04:58:38.590 --> 04:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
efficient and effective we just say okay
 
04:58:40.110 --> 04:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll take care of that for you
 
04:58:41.390 --> 04:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
will'll get all of your records and we
 
04:58:44.310 --> 04:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
need to follow up so follow if I may
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
have a followup so what I'm trying to
 
04:58:49.110 --> 04:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
get my mind around from from your side
 
04:58:51.990 --> 04:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
of things is why you are not supplying
 
04:58:54.708 --> 04:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
your client
 
04:58:57.310 --> 04:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
with the request that you would have
 
04:58:59.670 --> 04:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
made if you were doing it directly get
 
04:59:01.868 --> 04:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
them to sign it and get them to send it
 
04:59:06.510 --> 04:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
on and and I understanding the point
 
04:59:08.948 --> 04:59:08.958 align:start position:0%
about uh patients being either
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerable injured
 
04:59:12.868 --> 04:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
sick recovering or
 
04:59:15.868 --> 04:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
whatever isn't it the
 
04:59:18.430 --> 04:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
hospital's requirement to accommodate
 
04:59:20.788 --> 04:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
those disabilities in requesting the
 
04:59:22.990 --> 04:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
records it absolutely is it's a great
 
04:59:24.670 --> 04:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
question so what I can tell you is we do
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
do that we often do that in cases where
 
04:59:29.230 --> 04:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
we want to try to circumvent these
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary costs and my initial point
 
04:59:34.110 --> 04:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
would be why I mean why do we have to
 
04:59:35.750 --> 04:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
take these extra steps and put these
 
04:59:38.750 --> 04:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
people through this to get yeah no no
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine um so we do do that what we
 
04:59:44.030 --> 04:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
run into is we still have patients who
 
04:59:46.350 --> 04:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
are so catastro catastrophically injured
 
04:59:49.030 --> 04:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
I mean we have a lot of clients who are
 
04:59:51.788 --> 04:59:51.798 align:start position:0%
literally late like end stage cancer
 
04:59:54.708 --> 04:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
catastrophically injured from bad um
 
04:59:57.230 --> 04:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
surgeries to to have them try to go
 
04:59:58.708 --> 04:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
through that process to go to the
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
hospital and get the records and then
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
get them back to us can be more
 
05:00:04.150 --> 05:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
cumbersome than you might think given
 
05:00:06.350 --> 05:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
their personal circumstances we do have
 
05:00:08.030 --> 05:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
some clients who are able to do that and
 
05:00:10.590 --> 05:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
we do do that with them thank you sure
 
05:00:12.070 --> 05:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King and then
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
05:00:16.548 --> 05:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
05:00:18.628 --> 05:00:18.638 align:start position:0%
um I'm over here
 
05:00:20.548 --> 05:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
sorry your testimony was very
 
05:00:23.150 --> 05:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
informative I appreciate it um my
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
question for you is have you read C the
 
05:00:32.030 --> 05:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
current RSA 332 D ion one comma I have
 
05:00:34.670 --> 05:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
you read that I'm sure I have but I if
 
05:00:35.910 --> 05:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
if there was something in front of me or
 
05:00:37.590 --> 05:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to read something I don't
 
05:00:40.430 --> 05:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me um but I'm just
 
05:00:42.628 --> 05:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
curious because it sounds like based on
 
05:00:45.670 --> 05:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
your experience that individual patients
 
05:00:47.350 --> 05:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
are being only charged 650 and you are
 
05:00:49.310 --> 05:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
potentially being charge thousands it
 
05:00:51.670 --> 05:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's already price fixing
 
05:00:53.030 --> 05:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
to answer your question why the
 
05:00:54.990 --> 05:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
disparity it sounds to me like there's
 
05:00:57.270 --> 05:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
already price fixing going on mandated
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
by the government that does not allow
 
05:01:01.990 --> 05:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
these companies to release it to the
 
05:01:04.750 --> 05:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
patients for anything more than 650 but
 
05:01:07.788 --> 05:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
it does allow them to charge you and and
 
05:01:09.030 --> 05:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
to answer your question I mean I don't
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
know I'm just speculating here but it
 
05:01:13.670 --> 05:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
sounds like the true cost would be even
 
05:01:15.230 --> 05:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
potentially thousands of dollars for the
 
05:01:16.910 --> 05:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
patient as well but they're not legally
 
05:01:19.670 --> 05:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to and so therefore the price
 
05:01:22.590 --> 05:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
sharing kicks in where now other
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
patients that don't have anything to do
 
05:01:25.868 --> 05:01:25.878 align:start position:0%
with these medical records are having to
 
05:01:29.628 --> 05:01:29.638 align:start position:0%
bear the cost for the percentage of
 
05:01:32.110 --> 05:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
patients that do request these records
 
05:01:34.990 --> 05:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious uh it might be
 
05:01:36.310 --> 05:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
something worth looking into what are
 
05:01:38.190 --> 05:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that that maybe you
 
05:01:40.110 --> 05:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
know what you're paying is potentially
 
05:01:42.990 --> 05:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
the true cost and the the patient uh
 
05:01:45.270 --> 05:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
requesting it directly is paying a a
 
05:01:47.190 --> 05:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
subsidized cost yeah I hear what you're
 
05:01:48.830 --> 05:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
saying and I would I would have to look
 
05:01:50.430 --> 05:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
at the specific language of what you're
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
referring to in terms of the RSA but the
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
way I would respond to that is what I
 
05:01:57.868 --> 05:01:57.878 align:start position:0%
started with which is at bottom the fact
 
05:02:00.070 --> 05:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
that a patient can get this for 650 is
 
05:02:02.548 --> 05:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
not going to change I can't honestly
 
05:02:04.830 --> 05:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
can't foresee that ever changing and so
 
05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
you have this funky aspect of the system
 
05:02:09.910 --> 05:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
where the patient could get it for 650
 
05:02:12.070 --> 05:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
and it's essentially a litigation tax
 
05:02:14.948 --> 05:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
and and to go to that I will tell you
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
that in front of the Senate when we had
 
05:02:19.750 --> 05:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
a hearing on this a representative of
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
the hospital Association essentially not
 
05:02:25.230 --> 05:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
essentially explicitly acknowledged that
 
05:02:26.670 --> 05:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
they when they see a request from an
 
05:02:28.990 --> 05:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
attorney they basically say this is
 
05:02:30.910 --> 05:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
litigation so we're going to charge more
 
05:02:33.830 --> 05:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
so um to me it's a question of patient
 
05:02:36.430 --> 05:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
rights I mean should should that patient
 
05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
be charged more because their lawyer
 
05:02:40.750 --> 05:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
requests it versus is them getting it
 
05:02:42.350 --> 05:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
and should that be the mechanism of
 
05:02:44.270 --> 05:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
spreading around that cost sharing but
 
05:02:45.868 --> 05:02:45.878 align:start position:0%
it I understand your question it's a
 
05:02:48.070 --> 05:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
perfectly Fair one thank you sure
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and then
 
05:02:49.440 --> 05:02:50.948 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and then
representative

05:02:50.948 --> 05:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:02:53.230 --> 05:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
Lon so I understand this thank you for
 
05:02:55.270 --> 05:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
your testimonies very helpful of
 
05:02:57.628 --> 05:02:57.638 align:start position:0%
course it really comes down to tension
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned before between the attorney
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
and the hospital who's going to bear the
 
05:03:06.510 --> 05:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
cost so at this point in time what I'm
 
05:03:08.830 --> 05:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
hearing from the argument if I'm a
 
05:03:11.470 --> 05:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
patient outside of litigation and want
 
05:03:14.350 --> 05:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
my files I can get up at 650 but if I'm
 
05:03:16.830 --> 05:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
a trial attorney or malpractice attorney
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
and I ask for the records I'm going to
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
get charged at a different rate I think
 
05:03:21.910 --> 05:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
it came down to a court decision with
 
05:03:24.590 --> 05:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
Cox yeah
 
05:03:28.510 --> 05:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
so given the fact that as an attorney
 
05:03:30.830 --> 05:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
your livelihood is built upon finding a
 
05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
case that you can justify so what I'm
 
05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
trying to do is how do we avoid fishing
 
05:03:38.670 --> 05:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
Expeditions that cost us money because I
 
05:03:40.030 --> 05:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
would sit there and say at this point
 
05:03:42.390 --> 05:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
time I support what we doing but at the
 
05:03:45.590 --> 05:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
same time not having it so wide open
 
05:03:46.948 --> 05:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
that we have an opportunity we're going
 
05:03:49.708 --> 05:03:49.718 align:start position:0%
to create a lot of work to try to find
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
work so given the fact that you win the
 
05:03:56.708 --> 05:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
case would not at that point in time pay
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
back the fees in other words as an
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
attorney you have a retainer what you're
 
05:04:02.430 --> 05:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
doing is part of winning the cas is that
 
05:04:05.070 --> 05:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
you have to then take the proceeds from
 
05:04:06.628 --> 05:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
the settlement and part of that goes
 
05:04:08.230 --> 05:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
back to paying for the work you had to
 
05:04:11.868 --> 05:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
put into it yeah it's again a very good
 
05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
question so what I would tell you is the
 
05:04:17.910 --> 05:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
the way we operate is a contingency fee
 
05:04:19.548 --> 05:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
basis that's the standard in the
 
05:04:21.430 --> 05:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
industry what that means is we front all
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
of these costs for our clients these
 
05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
patients to get the records investigate
 
05:04:28.830 --> 05:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
the claim pursue the claim if there's no
 
05:04:31.270 --> 05:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
recovery we eat that cost if there is a
 
05:04:33.948 --> 05:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
recovery the those costs are then
 
05:04:37.310 --> 05:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursed to us so that $2,000 $2,500
 
05:04:39.270 --> 05:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
we lay out up front but if we win the
 
05:04:41.948 --> 05:04:41.958 align:start position:0%
case for the client we get it back I
 
05:04:42.830 --> 05:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying about the
 
05:04:45.430 --> 05:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
fishing Expedition aspect but but I
 
05:04:47.310 --> 05:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
think that contingency fee basis really
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
precludes that because I as the lawyer
 
05:04:52.430 --> 05:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
am putting my money where my mouth is
 
05:04:54.070 --> 05:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to pursue a claim I'm not
 
05:04:55.310 --> 05:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
going to spend the money on those
 
05:04:58.030 --> 05:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
records spend many thousands of dollars
 
05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
on an expert review for a case that I
 
05:05:03.470 --> 05:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
feel is frivolous um and that goes even
 
05:05:05.190 --> 05:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
from the outset when we get an intake
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
from a client most cases we can tell
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
right off the bat whether there might
 
05:05:12.190 --> 05:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
something there or not if we don't think
 
05:05:13.868 --> 05:05:13.878 align:start position:0%
that there's a very viable claim we're
 
05:05:15.190 --> 05:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
not going to spend that money to get
 
05:05:15.200 --> 05:05:16.868 align:start position:0%
not going to spend that money to get
those

05:05:16.868 --> 05:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
records follow up so thank you that
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
makes very sense to me so therefore
 
05:05:23.788 --> 05:05:23.798 align:start position:0%
could it be part of the contingency fee
 
05:05:26.590 --> 05:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
that if you'd win the case that part of
 
05:05:29.150 --> 05:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
it is you pay back the cost of those
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
records because that's really part of
 
05:05:33.628 --> 05:05:33.638 align:start position:0%
the process I think the issue with that
 
05:05:36.310 --> 05:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
would be if we win the case what that
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
means is that the hospital malpractice
 
05:05:40.990 --> 05:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
somebody and cause them extensive harm
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
so I think as a principle um I I would
 
05:05:47.350 --> 05:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
find that objectionable because I would
 
05:05:48.910 --> 05:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
think that's really part of what the
 
05:05:50.548 --> 05:05:50.558 align:start position:0%
hospital should have to compensate the
 
05:05:52.390 --> 05:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
patient for is they've caused harm to
 
05:05:54.788 --> 05:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
them they then give the records we
 
05:05:56.750 --> 05:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
review them we work up a viable claim
 
05:05:59.470 --> 05:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
and that's sort of part of the
 
05:06:02.990 --> 05:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
cost thank you sure representative Lon
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:06:06.628 --> 05:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
for being here um my question would be
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
if any other states have passed similar
 
05:06:10.788 --> 05:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
legislation and what the charges and
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
costs look like there yeah that's also a
 
05:06:15.708 --> 05:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
good question and we're happy we've done
 
05:06:18.270 --> 05:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
50 state surveys um so we're happy to
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
provide that to you and give you all
 
05:06:22.590 --> 05:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
that information the answer is yes this
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
this really is a national movement where
 
05:06:27.150 --> 05:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
um patients and lawyers across the
 
05:06:29.510 --> 05:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
country are fighting back against these
 
05:06:32.910 --> 05:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary costs and I know recently
 
05:06:32.920 --> 05:06:33.750 align:start position:0%
unnecessary costs and I know recently
there

05:06:33.750 --> 05:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:06:33.760 --> 05:06:35.590 align:start position:0%
there
were

05:06:35.590 --> 05:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:06:38.510 --> 05:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh yeah there were two states I know
 
05:06:40.110 --> 05:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
very recently that
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
passed similar legislation to this where
 
05:06:44.190 --> 05:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
I believe the Caps were under well under
 
05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
$100 and if you look at the 50 state
 
05:06:48.910 --> 05:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
survey they run the gamut I think the
 
05:06:52.750 --> 05:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
lowest state was $10 the cap so this
 
05:06:56.590 --> 05:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
would be the lowest um but it goes I
 
05:06:58.990 --> 05:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
think from $10 to a high cap of maybe
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
250 or something like that I I guess I
 
05:07:02.750 --> 05:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't make representations that I
 
05:07:04.350 --> 05:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
don't know for certain but it's roughly
 
05:07:07.230 --> 05:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
that range um I can tell you that it
 
05:07:09.670 --> 05:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
does seem like the momentum is to bring
 
05:07:11.310 --> 05:07:11.320 align:start position:0%
these down further and further for all
 
05:07:13.390 --> 05:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
of these reasons that these questions
 
05:07:14.868 --> 05:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
that you've been asking which is what's
 
05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
the justification for those costs thank
 
05:07:20.430 --> 05:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
you sure representative palazov thank
 
05:07:22.590 --> 05:07:22.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:07:25.510 --> 05:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
question as you explained you often want
 
05:07:29.430 --> 05:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh as as a big a picture as possible but
 
05:07:31.948 --> 05:07:31.958 align:start position:0%
is there an option to ask for a partial
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
record and is there any communication
 
05:07:38.548 --> 05:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
when they tell back to you oh this
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
client has a lot of Records on paper and
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
then macra film so it will cost more for
 
05:07:47.548 --> 05:07:47.558 align:start position:0%
you to get get a full
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
record yeah good question so um what I
 
05:07:52.708 --> 05:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
can tell you is I can't speak for every
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer who does this work but I I think
 
05:07:57.110 --> 05:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
I can say with confidence that most
 
05:07:58.670 --> 05:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
lawyers request everything
 
05:08:00.948 --> 05:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
electronically where it is electronic in
 
05:08:02.990 --> 05:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
other words I there aren't many lawyers
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
now who are saying I want reams of paper
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
records we want things electronically um
 
05:08:11.510 --> 05:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
I do I I think there are statistics to
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
back this up that most major medical
 
05:08:15.150 --> 05:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
providers do maintain their records
 
05:08:18.708 --> 05:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
electronically it's a not 100% but very
 
05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
close and actually that that's federally
 
05:08:23.230 --> 05:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
regul regulated they should be kept
 
05:08:26.830 --> 05:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
electronically now um in terms of how we
 
05:08:28.990 --> 05:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
request them we do try to be judicious
 
05:08:31.070 --> 05:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
about that so when we when we get a case
 
05:08:33.510 --> 05:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we look at records we don't just say
 
05:08:35.070 --> 05:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
we want every record Under the Sun in
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
the history of this person we look at
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
when the injury occurred what their
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
medical history is based on discussing
 
05:08:43.470 --> 05:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
it with the client um and we try to make
 
05:08:45.150 --> 05:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
targeted requests so that we're not
 
05:08:47.990 --> 05:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
wasting the hos the vendor and hospitals
 
05:08:49.708 --> 05:08:49.718 align:start position:0%
resources we're not wasting our own
 
05:08:52.030 --> 05:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
resources and then we take it one step
 
05:08:54.150 --> 05:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
at a time we get sometimes we might just
 
05:08:56.708 --> 05:08:56.718 align:start position:0%
get an abstract sometimes we might get a
 
05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
full set of records from one provider
 
05:09:01.150 --> 05:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
out of 10 or two providers out of 10 and
 
05:09:02.670 --> 05:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
then if we review those and we think
 
05:09:04.830 --> 05:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
there might be a viable claim and it's
 
05:09:06.990 --> 05:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
worth the effort and the patient
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
client's effort to look further than
 
05:09:10.868 --> 05:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
we'll request a additional record so I
 
05:09:12.750 --> 05:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
can tell you it's it's very unusual for
 
05:09:15.628 --> 05:09:15.638 align:start position:0%
us to have a client come in unless it's
 
05:09:17.868 --> 05:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
Crystal Clear you know they came in and
 
05:09:19.548 --> 05:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
the wrong leg was amputated or something
 
05:09:20.910 --> 05:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
like that then we're just going to say
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay let's get all the records but most
 
05:09:26.190 --> 05:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
claims were very targeted and specific
 
05:09:27.948 --> 05:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
about how we request
 
05:09:31.150 --> 05:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
those sure anyone else any other
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:39.750 --> 05:09:39.760 align:start position:0%

with written testimony and trying the
 
05:11:12.590 --> 05:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
speed tuck appreciate that Heather men
 
05:11:15.430 --> 05:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
menzes yes thank you U Mr chairman and
 
05:11:18.310 --> 05:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I am also a
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
personal injury attorney I do other
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
things other than medical malpractice as
 
05:11:26.350 --> 05:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
well I don't want paper ever for for the
 
05:11:30.628 --> 05:11:30.638 align:start position:0%
rec I we do typically request electronic
 
05:11:33.510 --> 05:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
um a few things just to bring up there
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
was something mentioned about the
 
05:11:39.750 --> 05:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
P about the patient portal um
 
05:11:41.548 --> 05:11:41.558 align:start position:0%
that does not include all the records so
 
05:11:43.230 --> 05:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
it's not like I could just log in and
 
05:11:47.910 --> 05:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
get everything um and also it I found it
 
05:11:50.708 --> 05:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
interesting that not only the patient
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
themselves they get the records it's 650
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
the provider to a provider so my primary
 
05:11:57.590 --> 05:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
care provider gets my orthopedist
 
05:11:59.990 --> 05:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
records no charge for that why is it
 
05:12:02.190 --> 05:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
different if the attorney on behalf of a
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
client then gets charged um and I'm I'm
 
05:12:08.948 --> 05:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any other questions uh I
 
05:12:10.948 --> 05:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
I do other things other than medical
 
05:12:13.788 --> 05:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
malpractice so um I do have one quick
 
05:12:16.910 --> 05:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
other point I wanted to make this uh the
 
05:12:19.150 --> 05:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
fact that these charges are very high
 
05:12:20.910 --> 05:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
affects not just plaintiff's attorneys
 
05:12:23.030 --> 05:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
but defense attorneys as well and the
 
05:12:25.150 --> 05:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
insurance industry because they also
 
05:12:28.110 --> 05:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
will request authorizations and we allow
 
05:12:30.070 --> 05:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
that they get the medical records and
 
05:12:33.150 --> 05:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's just it drives litigation expenses
 
05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
up for both sides we understand any
 
05:12:38.230 --> 05:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
 
05:12:40.030 --> 05:12:40.040 align:start position:0%

05:12:44.910 --> 05:12:44.920 align:start position:0%

through HHS and apparently I had
 
05:14:23.390 --> 05:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
promised to go ahead and put it in so um
 
05:14:27.070 --> 05:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
I have and basically this um allows
 
05:14:28.910 --> 05:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacists to continue giving get
 
05:14:30.390 --> 05:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines without having to get
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
legislative approval each time is so
 
05:14:35.470 --> 05:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
long as the vaccines are approved by the
 
05:14:37.110 --> 05:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
Food and Drug
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
Administration and with that I'll take
 
05:14:42.270 --> 05:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you questions
 
05:14:42.280 --> 05:14:43.948 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you questions
Senator

05:14:43.948 --> 05:14:43.958 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
05:14:46.470 --> 05:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
bzel representative Merchant thank you
 
05:14:49.510 --> 05:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you Mr chair um in regards
 
05:14:52.110 --> 05:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
to what you looking here the bill
 
05:14:54.788 --> 05:14:54.798 align:start position:0%
expands the administration of the
 
05:14:57.868 --> 05:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
vaccines to all vaccines for certified
 
05:15:00.510 --> 05:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
techs not limited to licensed Advanced
 
05:15:03.990 --> 05:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technicians technicians so
 
05:15:07.548 --> 05:15:07.558 align:start position:0%
why why include if you will certified
 
05:15:10.830 --> 05:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
technicians when all the vaccines just
 
05:15:13.350 --> 05:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
from a safety point of view um some of
 
05:15:16.628 --> 05:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
the vaccines are problematic and having
 
05:15:18.310 --> 05:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
somebody who's only certified not
 
05:15:21.030 --> 05:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
licensed given the vaccine could be
 
05:15:23.190 --> 05:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
problematic I'm just curious to why we
 
05:15:26.830 --> 05:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
expanded it to all certified Tex uh I
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
believe I spoke with Beth sergeant from
 
05:15:32.230 --> 05:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
the um earlier today and I I believe
 
05:15:33.868 --> 05:15:33.878 align:start position:0%
what was supposed to happen which didn't
 
05:15:37.270 --> 05:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
happen is there was a period after
 
05:15:39.948 --> 05:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
public and and then then it would go on
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
to the regular vaccines so if you want
 
05:15:45.030 --> 05:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
to entertain a an amendment for that I'd
 
05:15:47.430 --> 05:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
be more than open to it thank you
 
05:15:48.910 --> 05:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
because I picked up on the period
 
05:15:50.470 --> 05:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
turning into a
 
05:15:55.030 --> 05:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
comma so did Beth other questions
 
05:15:56.470 --> 05:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
05:15:59.548 --> 05:15:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:02.190 --> 05:16:02.200 align:start position:0%
King okay so I'm really confused because
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
the title is very confusing when I
 
05:16:06.190 --> 05:16:06.200 align:start position:0%
compare it to what the bill
 
05:16:09.150 --> 05:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
says um because the title is relative to
 
05:16:11.590 --> 05:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
allowing pharmacists to administer
 
05:16:14.110 --> 05:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
influenza covid-19 and other FDA
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
licensed vaccines without explicit
 
05:16:18.750 --> 05:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
permission from the general court well
 
05:16:21.510 --> 05:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
this is explicit permission if we pass
 
05:16:25.430 --> 05:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
it and what I see the bill doing and
 
05:16:27.110 --> 05:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm
 
05:16:31.990 --> 05:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:35.470 --> 05:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
currently uh influenza and covid-19 are
 
05:16:38.510 --> 05:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
already in the statute as being allowed
 
05:16:40.868 --> 05:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
administered by a pharmacist or a
 
05:16:47.910 --> 05:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacy intern or a licensed technician
 
05:16:49.910 --> 05:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
or a Certified Pharmacy Technician and
 
05:16:51.670 --> 05:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that all of that is
 
05:16:53.868 --> 05:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
already in the statute they can already
 
05:16:53.878 --> 05:16:54.868 align:start position:0%
already in the statute they can already
do

05:16:54.868 --> 05:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:16:58.548 --> 05:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
that what seems to me to be changing and
 
05:17:01.628 --> 05:17:01.638 align:start position:0%
the only thing I can see that's changing
 
05:17:06.150 --> 05:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
is that instead of the list of what can
 
05:17:09.030 --> 05:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
be administered we're changing the langu
 
05:17:11.868 --> 05:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
AG to all
 
05:17:14.590 --> 05:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines licensed by the US Food and
 
05:17:17.350 --> 05:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
Drug Administration that are recommended
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
by the
 
05:17:24.548 --> 05:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
CDC or successor organizations so am I
 
05:17:26.670 --> 05:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
correct in thinking that what the bill
 
05:17:28.628 --> 05:17:28.638 align:start position:0%
does or is this different from your
 
05:17:31.390 --> 05:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
intent that is the intent the intent is
 
05:17:36.470 --> 05:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
to allow any that comes online that's
 
05:17:41.030 --> 05:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:44.190 --> 05:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
um can then be administered without
 
05:17:48.350 --> 05:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
having to list the name of that new
 
05:17:50.910 --> 05:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
thing that is correct okay thank
 
05:17:53.788 --> 05:17:53.798 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Seth King thank
 
05:17:55.670 --> 05:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you senator for
 
05:18:00.670 --> 05:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
taking questions um why why are
 
05:18:03.788 --> 05:18:03.798 align:start position:0%
influenza and covid-19 also not
 
05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
scratched out with what is being
 
05:18:08.510 --> 05:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
scratched out why not just say vaccines
 
05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
Li by the United States blah blah blah
 
05:18:12.628 --> 05:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
why not just stick to that why why are
 
05:18:15.190 --> 05:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
why are those two explicitly named and
 
05:18:17.708 --> 05:18:17.718 align:start position:0%
kept in there why not just give rid of
 
05:18:20.590 --> 05:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
those as well I believe and um
 
05:18:21.990 --> 05:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant may be able to
 
05:18:23.948 --> 05:18:23.958 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but I believe
 
05:18:26.190 --> 05:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
the reason that's in there is because
 
05:18:28.868 --> 05:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
the pharmacists the interns um are
 
05:18:34.510 --> 05:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
eligible to um give those um vaccines
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why there's a period needed
 
05:18:40.788 --> 05:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:43.350 --> 05:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
followup um no I would just maybe
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant can better
 
05:18:45.708 --> 05:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
explain that I don't know if that's
 
05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
allowed I'm sure he had his hand up did
 
05:18:50.470 --> 05:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
did you hear the question representative
 
05:18:52.510 --> 05:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh could you repeat it please yeah why
 
05:18:56.548 --> 05:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
why are Co am I not allowed to do this
 
05:18:58.350 --> 05:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
you can
 
05:19:01.390 --> 05:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
testify my apologies I didn't I I will
 
05:19:04.590 --> 05:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
not ask him I will not ask okay thank
 
05:19:07.390 --> 05:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
you I know it's cumers representative
 
05:19:10.990 --> 05:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:13.548 --> 05:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:17.150 --> 05:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
believe um I think the clarification is
 
05:19:19.310 --> 05:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
by striking after the word period under
 
05:19:21.750 --> 05:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
the general public my concern is that we
 
05:19:23.948 --> 05:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
took the phrase out a pharmacist
 
05:19:26.270 --> 05:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacist intern in licensed pharmacy
 
05:19:27.788 --> 05:19:27.798 align:start position:0%
technician on the supervision of
 
05:19:29.910 --> 05:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
licensed Pharmacy then what we want to
 
05:19:31.548 --> 05:19:31.558 align:start position:0%
do at that point in time is Strike
 
05:19:35.310 --> 05:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
listing all the vaccines and then say
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines licensed by the United States
 
05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
Food and Drug Administration are
 
05:19:41.150 --> 05:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
recommended by the US centers of Disease
 
05:19:42.470 --> 05:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
Control and prevention advisory
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee so we're trying to do is get
 
05:19:46.190 --> 05:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
get away from listing for the pharmacist
 
05:19:48.390 --> 05:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacist intern and licensed pharmacy
 
05:19:51.150 --> 05:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
technician a list of vaccines so as we
 
05:19:53.190 --> 05:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
go down the road and the FDA puts
 
05:19:55.670 --> 05:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
another vaccine on that list we have the
 
05:19:58.510 --> 05:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
authority to do it correct fundamentally
 
05:20:02.548 --> 05:20:02.558 align:start position:0%
I would believe that thank you other
 
05:20:04.708 --> 05:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
paza thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so um State
 
05:20:15.548 --> 05:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist uh Dr Benjamin Chan
 
05:20:18.590 --> 05:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
testified in this committee that
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines are associated with
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
increased risk of
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
myocarditis specifically for younger
 
05:20:30.788 --> 05:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
males uh do do you know how long did it
 
05:20:34.510 --> 05:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
take for FDA and CDC to recognize this
 
05:20:36.910 --> 05:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
fact and stop
 
05:20:39.948 --> 05:20:39.958 align:start position:0%
censoring uh Medical professionals on
 
05:20:43.030 --> 05:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
this topic and what makes you believe
 
05:20:46.670 --> 05:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
that they a good entities for us to
 
05:20:49.628 --> 05:20:49.638 align:start position:0%
follow in vaccine
 
05:20:52.070 --> 05:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations if I understand the
 
05:20:53.830 --> 05:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
question correctly you're just you're
 
05:20:55.510 --> 05:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
asking whether or not what makes me
 
05:20:57.510 --> 05:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
05:21:02.190 --> 05:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
covid-19 is an authorized
 
05:21:09.548 --> 05:21:09.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh G given the P for example
 
05:21:14.190 --> 05:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
in uh how long it took FDA and CDC to
 
05:21:16.948 --> 05:21:16.958 align:start position:0%
recognize the risk of for younger males
 
05:21:21.310 --> 05:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
from of my carditis from uh covid-19
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh what makes you believe that
 
05:21:27.670 --> 05:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
those entities are good better than
 
05:21:32.310 --> 05:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
General uh Court in approving a list of
 
05:21:35.510 --> 05:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:37.910 --> 05:21:37.920 align:start position:0%

05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
Health Services uh the Department's not
 
05:22:23.868 --> 05:22:23.878 align:start position:0%
taking a position on the bill but I just
 
05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to draw your attention um in the
 
05:22:28.910 --> 05:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
bill on line five where it says covid
 
05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
and a covid-19 vaccine if available to
 
05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
the general public that line allows
 
05:22:36.788 --> 05:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
pharmacists to give um covid vaccines to
 
05:22:38.548 --> 05:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
children so that that's important to
 
05:22:40.510 --> 05:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
keep in the bill just wanted to clarify
 
05:22:42.628 --> 05:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
that the Gen the general public Clause
 
05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
allows um allows that for children and
 
05:22:48.310 --> 05:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh pharmacists can give flu vaccines and
 
05:22:50.070 --> 05:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines to children and that
 
05:22:51.910 --> 05:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
Clause that says to the general public
 
05:22:54.350 --> 05:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
is is uh important to keep that to in
 
05:22:57.150 --> 05:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
there to to signify that okay are you
 
05:22:59.948 --> 05:22:59.958 align:start position:0%

05:23:11.910 --> 05:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
my question so if the intent of the bill
 
05:23:13.868 --> 05:23:13.878 align:start position:0%
is to
 
05:23:13.878 --> 05:23:15.628 align:start position:0%
is to
allow

05:23:15.628 --> 05:23:15.638 align:start position:0%
allow
 
05:23:19.230 --> 05:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
new uh vaccines that coming down the
 
05:23:23.470 --> 05:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
pipe uh uh are you aware of anything
 
05:23:27.270 --> 05:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
that is coming our away from FDA and
 
05:23:31.070 --> 05:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
CDC I'm not uh I'm not aware of that um
 
05:23:32.230 --> 05:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
but I certainly can get you that
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
information I can go back to the
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
department and and ask if and certainly
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
R relay that back to you sure anyway
 
05:23:41.708 --> 05:23:41.718 align:start position:0%
anyone else any questions for SL our
 
05:23:43.868 --> 05:23:43.878 align:start position:0%
representative frus yes I just have a
 
05:23:47.470 --> 05:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
question about children on the bill it
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
says to individuals 18 years of age or
 
05:23:53.310 --> 05:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
older so did I misunderstand when you
 
05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
said children oh yes so the bill when
 
05:23:58.830 --> 05:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
you see the strike out there um and then
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
it comes down and it says um this bill
 
05:24:03.750 --> 05:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
is intended to be for 18 years and older
 
05:24:05.628 --> 05:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
to remove those requirements but I was
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
just pointing out that in the in line
 
05:24:09.150 --> 05:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
five where it says
 
05:24:11.230 --> 05:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
um onsite immunizing pharmacists May
 
05:24:13.708 --> 05:24:13.718 align:start position:0%
administer flu and covid if available to
 
05:24:16.470 --> 05:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
the general public that means that flu
 
05:24:18.350 --> 05:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
flu the only two immunizations I believe
 
05:24:19.750 --> 05:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
that pharmacist can give right now are
 
05:24:22.670 --> 05:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
flu and um covid to children but that
 
05:24:25.350 --> 05:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
Claus general public accompass his
 
05:24:27.948 --> 05:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
children okay I just if that's if that
 
05:24:29.548 --> 05:24:29.558 align:start position:0%
answers your
 
05:24:32.590 --> 05:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
question well sort of because it says
 
05:24:36.110 --> 05:24:36.120 align:start position:0%

amending the statute what we're doing is
 
05:27:37.430 --> 05:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
number one adding a new definition
 
05:27:40.948 --> 05:27:40.958 align:start position:0%
Within this statute of biological
 
05:27:43.708 --> 05:27:43.718 align:start position:0%
product two we are updating the
 
05:27:46.708 --> 05:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
definitions of Assessments assess
 
05:27:49.270 --> 05:27:49.280 align:start position:0%

products including monoclonal antibody
 
05:27:58.868 --> 05:27:58.878 align:start position:0%
products again this is for the again for
 
05:28:00.430 --> 05:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
the purposes of the New Hampshire
 
05:28:04.150 --> 05:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association this is a technical
 
05:28:07.190 --> 05:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
transactional change what will allow for
 
05:28:08.868 --> 05:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
two things
 
05:28:12.430 --> 05:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
to happen one to more accurately reflect
 
05:28:14.310 --> 05:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
immunization products that are currently
 
05:28:16.670 --> 05:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
available and recommended for children
 
05:28:19.390 --> 05:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
to protect their health number two it
 
05:28:21.750 --> 05:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
will enable the New Hampshire vaccine
 
05:28:25.590 --> 05:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
Association to receive payments known as
 
05:28:28.548 --> 05:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
assessments from payers from our health
 
05:28:31.390 --> 05:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
insurers for newly available
 
05:28:33.270 --> 05:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
immunizations and in this case we're
 
05:28:36.070 --> 05:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
talking about this monoclonal antibody
 
05:28:38.350 --> 05:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
as included in the new definition a
 
05:28:41.150 --> 05:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
biological product offered so this would
 
05:28:42.910 --> 05:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
be for offering it to commercially
 
05:28:44.670 --> 05:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
insured children through the New
 
05:28:47.548 --> 05:28:47.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire immunization program as it
 
05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
stands today Insurance funds these
 
05:28:52.470 --> 05:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
assessments largely fund the New
 
05:28:55.070 --> 05:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire imization program and their
 
05:28:56.788 --> 05:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
vaccines for children also their
 
05:28:58.750 --> 05:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines for children programs so that
 
05:29:00.990 --> 05:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
they are able to provide all New
 
05:29:02.670 --> 05:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children from birth through
 
05:29:05.670 --> 05:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
age 18 with routinely recommended
 
05:29:07.788 --> 05:29:07.798 align:start position:0%
vaccines at no cost to the healthcare
 
05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
Pro provider or family with parental
 
05:29:13.990 --> 05:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
consent a new timely and important
 
05:29:15.868 --> 05:29:15.878 align:start position:0%
immunization product has become
 
05:29:18.788 --> 05:29:18.798 align:start position:0%
available for babies so this would be
 
05:29:22.548 --> 05:29:22.558 align:start position:0%
newborns babies toddlers up to 18 months
 
05:29:25.750 --> 05:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
to protect them against RSV this is a
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
respiratory virus that usually causes
 
05:29:30.590 --> 05:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
mild symptoms but they can also be very
 
05:29:33.150 --> 05:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
serious symptoms for example pneumonia
 
05:29:34.830 --> 05:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
leading to a
 
05:29:37.430 --> 05:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
hospitalization the protection the
 
05:29:39.868 --> 05:29:39.878 align:start position:0%
immunization this product is now
 
05:29:42.590 --> 05:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
available and comes in the form again of
 
05:29:45.310 --> 05:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
a biological product a monoclonal
 
05:29:48.110 --> 05:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
antibody these proteins made they're
 
05:29:50.350 --> 05:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
proteins made in Laboratories meant to
 
05:29:51.990 --> 05:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
stimulate your immune system and
 
05:29:54.070 --> 05:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
probably as I look over representative
 
05:29:56.470 --> 05:29:56.480 align:start position:0%

05:29:58.868 --> 05:29:58.878 align:start position:0%
he can speak to this uh probably better
 
05:30:01.628 --> 05:30:01.638 align:start position:0%
than anybody but that is that's what
 
05:30:04.350 --> 05:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here in order for
 
05:30:06.030 --> 05:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccines for children
 
05:30:08.830 --> 05:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
program to offer this biologic product
 
05:30:10.470 --> 05:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
we need to technically correct the
 
05:30:15.670 --> 05:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
statute so the RSA 126 Q to continue
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
allowing for the purchase the trans the
 
05:30:21.030 --> 05:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
purchases and the transactions by the
 
05:30:22.990 --> 05:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine Association
 
05:30:24.868 --> 05:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
through an equitable assessment paid by
 
05:30:27.190 --> 05:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
all commercial payers again our insurers
 
05:30:29.910 --> 05:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
for the commercially insured children
 
05:30:32.788 --> 05:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
which will save insurers and patients
 
05:30:36.470 --> 05:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
their families money and provide access
 
05:30:39.510 --> 05:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
to immunizations again with the consent
 
05:30:42.830 --> 05:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
available for New Hampshire children so
 
05:30:45.150 --> 05:30:45.160 align:start position:0%
in closing this bill allows for the New
 
05:30:47.070 --> 05:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association to receive
 
05:30:49.628 --> 05:30:49.638 align:start position:0%
payments known as assessments from
 
05:30:51.910 --> 05:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
commercial payers for newly available
 
05:30:54.350 --> 05:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
immunizations here via a biologic
 
05:30:56.430 --> 05:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
product offered to commercially insure
 
05:30:57.788 --> 05:30:57.798 align:start position:0%
children through the New Hampshire
 
05:31:00.628 --> 05:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
immunization program two this technical
 
05:31:03.548 --> 05:31:03.558 align:start position:0%
change is related to the financing and
 
05:31:06.590 --> 05:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
provide financing and providing access
 
05:31:08.708 --> 05:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
to immunizations through through the New
 
05:31:10.510 --> 05:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine vaccination for
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
children's program and three parents
 
05:31:15.310 --> 05:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
make the decisions on their children's
 
05:31:17.990 --> 05:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
immunization needs um I
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
am it's it's this has been this has been
 
05:31:24.510 --> 05:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
a product of working with the payers the
 
05:31:27.430 --> 05:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
insurers um and the vaccine Association
 
05:31:29.310 --> 05:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
to get this right knowing that we had to
 
05:31:31.350 --> 05:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
make this technical change in order to
 
05:31:33.910 --> 05:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
be able to make this available to those
 
05:31:35.670 --> 05:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
that want it so I want to thank everyone
 
05:31:37.230 --> 05:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
that has been working on this over the
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
last few months
 
05:31:41.070 --> 05:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
um I am happy to answer any questions
 
05:31:42.548 --> 05:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
that you might have I do have some
 
05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
experts here that are better suited to
 
05:31:47.910 --> 05:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
talk about the technical side of the
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
assessments um the vaccination
 
05:31:53.030 --> 05:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
Association the vaccines for children
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
program basically how this all works so
 
05:31:58.230 --> 05:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and I hope to
 
05:32:00.830 --> 05:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
come out of committee with an aop pass
 
05:32:02.470 --> 05:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
um as we were we saw on the Senate
 
05:32:05.788 --> 05:32:05.798 align:start position:0%
unanimously thank you okay uh Senator uh
 
05:32:08.430 --> 05:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
05:32:09.948 --> 05:32:09.958 align:start position:0%
chair thank you senator for taking
 
05:32:13.470 --> 05:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
questions um the covid vaccine would
 
05:32:16.830 --> 05:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
that go under a definition of vaccine or
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
biological product uh
 
05:32:21.788 --> 05:32:21.798 align:start position:0%
biological um
 
05:32:24.708 --> 05:32:24.718 align:start position:0%
products I believe it's under vacine so
 
05:32:26.190 --> 05:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question believe it's
 
05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine I'm looking over to
 
05:32:29.470 --> 05:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant but it's not
 
05:32:31.510 --> 05:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a biologic product is it I
 
05:32:32.628 --> 05:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
don't know it's interesting because you
 
05:32:35.190 --> 05:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
you referred to the biological products
 
05:32:38.910 --> 05:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
um as like monoclonal antibodies right
 
05:32:40.708 --> 05:32:40.718 align:start position:0%
which is my understanding is that's what
 
05:32:45.230 --> 05:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
the vacc was no am I incorrect
 
05:32:49.708 --> 05:32:49.718 align:start position:0%
that it's mRNA okay it's a different
 
05:32:52.830 --> 05:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
it's a vaccine um not to get into
 
05:32:55.030 --> 05:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
technicalities but there's active and
 
05:32:56.750 --> 05:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
passive an active one is actually
 
05:32:59.788 --> 05:32:59.798 align:start position:0%
stimulates the body to make its own
 
05:33:02.670 --> 05:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
antibodies which anent antigen if you
 
05:33:05.708 --> 05:33:05.718 align:start position:0%
will passive which is RSV is actually
 
05:33:07.470 --> 05:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
antibodies injected into the body which
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
are relatively quick acting but short it
 
05:33:12.390 --> 05:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
lived and only last for up to 3 or four
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
months okay so can in that in that vein
 
05:33:19.070 --> 05:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um can you can you name a
 
05:33:21.868 --> 05:33:21.878 align:start position:0%
certain I suppose shot right now that
 
05:33:24.070 --> 05:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
would be classified as a biological
 
05:33:28.110 --> 05:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
product as opposed to a vaccine so yes U
 
05:33:30.070 --> 05:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you for the
 
05:33:36.030 --> 05:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
question so uh re I'm going to RSV it's
 
05:33:38.670 --> 05:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
for RSV reab
 
05:33:41.070 --> 05:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
which um I'm just not doing well with
 
05:33:42.548 --> 05:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
the name that is what we're talking
 
05:33:45.070 --> 05:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
about here that's the biologic product
 
05:33:47.230 --> 05:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome new to me
 
05:33:49.470 --> 05:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
it's all new to me thank you good other
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
question too did I see a hand go up down

05:34:31.190 --> 05:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
support of SB 559 as amended by the
 
05:34:34.230 --> 05:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
Senate um so New Hampshire um ahip
 
05:34:35.948 --> 05:34:35.958 align:start position:0%
members share in the commitment to
 
05:34:37.390 --> 05:34:37.400 align:start position:0%
ensure that children have access to
 
05:34:39.310 --> 05:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
their routine age appropriate
 
05:34:41.150 --> 05:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and remain committed
 
05:34:44.070 --> 05:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
partners with the nhba um we have
 
05:34:46.110 --> 05:34:46.120 align:start position:0%
appreciated the proactive dialogue that
 
05:34:48.310 --> 05:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
we engaged with starting back probably
 
05:34:50.750 --> 05:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
last August um with the um New Hampshire
 
05:34:52.030 --> 05:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association and other
 
05:34:53.750 --> 05:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders around the challenges of
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
including the RSV immunization in the
 
05:34:59.310 --> 05:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
state's program um as you have heard uh
 
05:35:01.390 --> 05:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
this bill will amend the current law to
 
05:35:03.548 --> 05:35:03.558 align:start position:0%
enable the vaccine Association to
 
05:35:06.868 --> 05:35:06.878 align:start position:0%
continue to equitably assess um continue
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
Equitable assess assing um the
 
05:35:11.590 --> 05:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
statutorily defined uh accessible
 
05:35:14.150 --> 05:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
entities um including carriers and third
 
05:35:16.708 --> 05:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
party administrators based on child
 
05:35:19.590 --> 05:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
covered lives uh consistent with the law
 
05:35:22.190 --> 05:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
and also consistent with the association
 
05:35:24.030 --> 05:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
um's plan of
 
05:35:26.030 --> 05:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
operation which is a document that's
 
05:35:28.350 --> 05:35:28.360 align:start position:0%
available on their website um fully
 
05:35:29.948 --> 05:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
insured and self-funded Commercial
 
05:35:31.750 --> 05:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
payers have been participating in the
 
05:35:33.948 --> 05:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire immunization program for
 
05:35:36.548 --> 05:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
many years um and through assessments we
 
05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
have been financing vaccine purchases
 
05:35:41.670 --> 05:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
for commercially insur insured children
 
05:35:43.470 --> 05:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
through providers that participate in
 
05:35:46.190 --> 05:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
the program this bill will um continue
 
05:35:48.150 --> 05:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
that partnership with the program for
 
05:35:52.270 --> 05:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
the RSV RSV um uh
 
05:35:54.590 --> 05:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
immunization um I did want to point out
 
05:35:57.190 --> 05:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire um ahip members
 
05:35:59.470 --> 05:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
have been covering the RSV vaccine
 
05:36:01.110 --> 05:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
without cost sharing since the early
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
fall um so even though the RSV vaccine
 
05:36:06.070 --> 05:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
has not been part of the state's program
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
it has been covered for INF and children
 
05:36:10.390 --> 05:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
receiving the vaccine either in the
 
05:36:13.910 --> 05:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
hospital or in a provider setting and um
 
05:36:15.990 --> 05:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
it will continue to be covered in
 
05:36:19.310 --> 05:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals and provider settings um where
 
05:36:21.190 --> 05:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
the hospital or the provider is not a
 
05:36:23.110 --> 05:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
registered participant in the New
 
05:36:25.628 --> 05:36:25.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire immunization program um so
 
05:36:28.030 --> 05:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
there's coverage whether you're in
 
05:36:30.788 --> 05:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
whether the provider is in or out um
 
05:36:31.990 --> 05:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that I know there are
 
05:36:35.230 --> 05:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
people behind me who are um
 
05:36:38.150 --> 05:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
much more versed in this than I but I'm
 
05:36:40.030 --> 05:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer any questions
 
05:36:42.708 --> 05:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you again
 
05:36:44.830 --> 05:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
05:36:46.310 --> 05:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
questions I'm still trying to wrap my
 
05:36:48.150 --> 05:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
head around this a little bit that
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
before these new biological products
 
05:36:54.030 --> 05:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
came about there was an RSV vaccine
 
05:36:56.230 --> 05:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
right there there there was such a thing
 
05:36:58.470 --> 05:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
as an RSB vaccine I don't believe so
 
05:37:01.390 --> 05:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
there never was not that I'm aware of
 
05:37:02.788 --> 05:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
I'm probably not the best person to
 
05:37:06.150 --> 05:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
answer but what I've come to understand
 
05:37:07.788 --> 05:37:07.798 align:start position:0%
this is something new that came came to
 
05:37:12.230 --> 05:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
the market specifically for that okay um
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
but um in in your testimony a moment ago
 
05:37:16.750 --> 05:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
at first it seemed like you called it
 
05:37:19.390 --> 05:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
the RSV immunization but then a moment
 
05:37:21.750 --> 05:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
later you called it the vaccine but it's
 
05:37:23.470 --> 05:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
it's not a vaccine it's a biological
 
05:37:26.110 --> 05:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
product what what do I call this what do
 
05:37:28.548 --> 05:37:28.558 align:start position:0%
I call this in you know because it's
 
05:37:30.470 --> 05:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
easy to say oh I'm going to go get this
 
05:37:32.830 --> 05:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine what do I call these new things
 
05:37:34.070 --> 05:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go get this biological
 
05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
product I mean what do I I don't know
 
05:37:36.548 --> 05:37:36.558 align:start position:0%
what to call it I think probably
 
05:37:38.510 --> 05:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
immunization is
 
05:37:42.230 --> 05:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
the more proper term I um I think it's
 
05:37:44.070 --> 05:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
if you read in the press for example or
 
05:37:46.230 --> 05:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
that was I think you see them referring
 
05:37:48.350 --> 05:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
to it as an RSV vaccine but I think
 
05:37:50.830 --> 05:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
technically speaking you're correct I
 
05:37:53.670 --> 05:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
believe technically it is not a vaccine
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
as in meeting the statutory definition
 
05:37:57.628 --> 05:37:57.638 align:start position:0%
okay sounds like the media has their
 
05:37:59.548 --> 05:37:59.558 align:start position:0%
work cut out for them on this one thank
 
05:38:02.150 --> 05:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
you other
 
05:38:04.270 --> 05:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
questions saying no other question oh
 
05:38:04.280 --> 05:38:05.470 align:start position:0%
questions saying no other question oh
representative

05:38:05.470 --> 05:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:38:08.670 --> 05:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
paza thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:38:13.230 --> 05:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh so my
 
05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
05:38:20.990 --> 05:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
that uh there's a a good science behind
 
05:38:25.230 --> 05:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
monoclonal antibody uh products
 
05:38:27.310 --> 05:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
technology and
 
05:38:30.788 --> 05:38:30.798 align:start position:0%
U but we are opening here
 
05:38:34.670 --> 05:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
for very open definition of biological
 
05:38:37.548 --> 05:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
product and I wonder if you will be am
 
05:38:37.558 --> 05:38:38.468 align:start position:0%
product and I wonder if you will be am
able

05:38:38.468 --> 05:38:38.478 align:start position:0%
able
 
05:38:43.548 --> 05:38:43.558 align:start position:0%
to uh staying focused on uh antibodies
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh because uh there are so many
 
05:38:48.788 --> 05:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
technologies that are not ready for
 
05:38:52.670 --> 05:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
prime time uh but uh there's a concern
 
05:38:57.350 --> 05:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
that there will be a market incentive to
 
05:39:02.070 --> 05:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
um uh to open them up like for example
 
05:39:05.510 --> 05:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
um we have mRNA based vaccines but now
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
there's a talks about in inting them
 
05:39:11.868 --> 05:39:11.878 align:start position:0%
into food so food would deliver mRNA
 
05:39:14.750 --> 05:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
particles and force the body to produce
 
05:39:18.708 --> 05:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
some proteins like toxic uh covid-19
 
05:39:22.910 --> 05:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
Spike protein and others so I wonder uh
 
05:39:25.150 --> 05:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
what's your thought about being focused
 
05:39:27.150 --> 05:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
on just
 
05:39:29.430 --> 05:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
antibodies so thank you for the question
 
05:39:31.468 --> 05:39:31.478 align:start position:0%
I would respectfully um if you don't
 
05:39:33.670 --> 05:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
mind defer that question to people um
 
05:39:34.910 --> 05:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
who are going to speak next because
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's really not my area of expertise
 
05:39:39.670 --> 05:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
05:39:41.910 --> 05:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:39:44.150 --> 05:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
mour thank you Mr chair and I don't know
 
05:39:46.708 --> 05:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
if you can answer this but
 
05:39:50.310 --> 05:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
um we we hear a lot about mRNA is that a
 
05:39:52.590 --> 05:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
part of anything to do with this
 
05:39:55.750 --> 05:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
bill I see nods and I see headshakes I
 
05:39:58.590 --> 05:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
don't so I don't believe so but again I
 
05:40:00.590 --> 05:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
would defer to The Experts behind me
 
05:40:02.628 --> 05:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up yeah would you
 
05:40:05.750 --> 05:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
believe that the past 3 years have made
 
05:40:09.070 --> 05:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
bills like this cause me a lot of
 
05:40:12.830 --> 05:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
anxiety when I see this so um I really
 
05:40:14.510 --> 05:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
would love an answer to that question
 
05:40:17.230 --> 05:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
before I leave here sure representative
 
05:40:19.788 --> 05:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
Merchant if I can clarify it I went on
 
05:40:25.468 --> 05:40:25.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:27.628 --> 05:40:27.638 align:start position:0%
website I'm going to ask a question if
 
05:40:30.510 --> 05:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
you go on a CDC website will you find
 
05:40:34.190 --> 05:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
mRNA covered under the child's vaccine
 
05:40:36.548 --> 05:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
program I would I would believe that
 
05:40:39.948 --> 05:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:41.030 --> 05:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:40:46.750 --> 05:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:49.350 --> 05:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Patrick
 
05:40:56.350 --> 05:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:58.110 --> 05:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
Association I guess you have some
 
05:41:01.110 --> 05:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
testimony to pass out or um I did hand
 
05:41:03.468 --> 05:41:03.478 align:start position:0%
oh you did okay you've asked for 3 to 5
 
05:41:05.670 --> 05:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
minutes please keep it close to three
 
05:41:06.788 --> 05:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
we'll do my best and we'll have
 
05:41:09.310 --> 05:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
questions after anyway sure absolutely
 
05:41:12.310 --> 05:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon um chairman McDonald
 
05:41:13.590 --> 05:41:13.600 align:start position:0%

05:43:59.190 --> 05:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh immunity from persecution uh would
 
05:44:01.670 --> 05:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
biological product uh that is
 
05:44:04.948 --> 05:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
recommended by advisory committee on
 
05:44:07.910 --> 05:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
immunization practices uh
 
05:44:10.430 --> 05:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
also be exempt
 
05:44:15.430 --> 05:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
from um like regular vaccines are exempt
 
05:44:19.150 --> 05:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
from certain L yous
 
05:44:21.868 --> 05:44:21.878 align:start position:0%
and not sure understand the
 
05:44:25.548 --> 05:44:25.558 align:start position:0%
question so that so so there are certain
 
05:44:29.070 --> 05:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh protections uh That vaccine
 
05:44:31.150 --> 05:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers uh
 
05:44:35.310 --> 05:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
enjoy uh with regard uh to vaccine
 
05:44:38.750 --> 05:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
injury loss you an so would this
 
05:44:43.510 --> 05:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
biological products as defined here uh
 
05:44:47.350 --> 05:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
are they also uh um
 
05:44:51.230 --> 05:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
have so um in order for um any type of
 
05:44:53.190 --> 05:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
immunization whether it be a vaccine or
 
05:44:55.350 --> 05:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
biological product to be paid for
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
through the state's program it has to
 
05:44:59.150 --> 05:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
receive multiple levels of approval
 
05:45:01.910 --> 05:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's an FDA approval uh there's a CDC
 
05:45:04.350 --> 05:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
approval and ultimately the state itself
 
05:45:05.830 --> 05:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
can determine uh through the
 
05:45:07.270 --> 05:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
commissioners of health and Human
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
Services whether or not that will be
 
05:45:11.390 --> 05:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
actually something added to the list so
 
05:45:14.270 --> 05:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
um we're treating biological products um
 
05:45:16.510 --> 05:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
in this uh language adjustment this
 
05:45:19.270 --> 05:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
technical fix to be the same language
 
05:45:21.910 --> 05:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
that we use for vaccines does that
 
05:45:25.030 --> 05:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:27.910 --> 05:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
question okay I'm sorry representative
 
05:45:27.920 --> 05:45:29.590 align:start position:0%
question okay I'm sorry representative
Weber

05:45:29.590 --> 05:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
05:45:32.750 --> 05:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
yes and isn't it true that the New
 
05:45:35.708 --> 05:45:35.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association is simply
 
05:45:39.510 --> 05:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
an organization which procures product
 
05:45:42.270 --> 05:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
at a discount because it is a
 
05:45:45.510 --> 05:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
huge procurer of product and the
 
05:45:48.590 --> 05:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
distributor of product amongst its
 
05:45:52.190 --> 05:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
members and others and it has nothing to
 
05:45:55.708 --> 05:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
do whatsoever nor does this statute have
 
05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
anything to do whatsoever with limits of
 
05:46:02.110 --> 05:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
liability for the product or anything
 
05:46:05.948 --> 05:46:05.958 align:start position:0%
else right so um that is almost correct
 
05:46:07.708 --> 05:46:07.718 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the Hampshire vaccine
 
05:46:10.510 --> 05:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
Association it's truly a financial
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism so there are Health insurers
 
05:46:15.670 --> 05:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's 80 or so that we work with and
 
05:46:17.708 --> 05:46:17.718 align:start position:0%
essentially we assess or tax them a
 
05:46:20.190 --> 05:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money we then transfer
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
those funds to the Department of Health
 
05:46:24.070 --> 05:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health leverages those
 
05:46:26.590 --> 05:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
funds against federal funds at this
 
05:46:28.948 --> 05:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
discount procures them and then they're
 
05:46:31.750 --> 05:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
sent directly to the provider offices so
 
05:46:33.510 --> 05:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccine Association
 
05:46:35.468 --> 05:46:35.478 align:start position:0%
again doesn't make any policy it was
 
05:46:37.948 --> 05:46:37.958 align:start position:0%
developed really as a cost saving
 
05:46:40.990 --> 05:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism um for everybody at the end of
 
05:46:43.150 --> 05:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
the day but also I think even more
 
05:46:45.548 --> 05:46:45.558 align:start position:0%
importantly for the providers um they
 
05:46:47.310 --> 05:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to procure things on their
 
05:46:48.910 --> 05:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
own and then build the carrier
 
05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
separately it all comes as one Blended
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
stock and I know there's providers here
 
05:46:56.030 --> 05:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
today um and so whenever a child
 
05:46:57.670 --> 05:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
presents no matter what the type of
 
05:46:59.830 --> 05:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
insurance they have this program because
 
05:47:02.230 --> 05:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
a universal program ensures that that
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
physician can make that available as
 
05:47:06.910 --> 05:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
long as you know the parent and and the
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know agrees that that's what's going
 
05:47:10.468 --> 05:47:10.478 align:start position:0%
to be given to the child so we're really
 
05:47:12.750 --> 05:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
just a funding mechanism and this is
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
really this biological product language
 
05:47:17.310 --> 05:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
is just to allow us to assess those 0
 
05:47:20.510 --> 05:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
Health insurers for biologic products so
 
05:47:22.510 --> 05:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
that we can buy them at a discount and
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
provide them to the provider offices
 
05:47:25.750 --> 05:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you does that
 
05:47:32.670 --> 05:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:35.030 --> 05:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing no other questions
 
05:47:41.910 --> 05:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:43.990 --> 05:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is laa Condon
 
05:47:44.000 --> 05:47:49.830 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is laa Condon

05:47:49.830 --> 05:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
Bedford you have some testimony it looks
 
05:48:12.548 --> 05:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:13.830 --> 05:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
you've asked for five minutes I really
 
05:48:15.990 --> 05:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
need you to keep it around three please
 
05:48:18.190 --> 05:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
let me do my best I will have to ask you
 
05:48:28.350 --> 05:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:28.360 --> 05:48:30.350 align:start position:0%
 
please

05:48:30.350 --> 05:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:48:32.830 --> 05:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead when when you're ready
 
05:48:34.948 --> 05:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon shamman McDonald my name
 
05:48:36.910 --> 05:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
is Laura Condon I'm from Bedford New
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm a volunteer New Hampshire
 
05:48:40.910 --> 05:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
director of advocacy for the national
 
05:48:43.910 --> 05:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine information center I have also
 
05:48:45.590 --> 05:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
served in the board of directors of the
 
05:48:47.310 --> 05:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine Association for
 
05:48:49.230 --> 05:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
five years and continue to attend all
 
05:48:51.628 --> 05:48:51.638 align:start position:0%
their meetings I know this program very
 
05:48:53.990 --> 05:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
well I'm here today to testify an
 
05:48:56.830 --> 05:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
opposition to Senate Bill 559 this is
 
05:48:58.910 --> 05:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
not a simple transactional change has
 
05:49:01.430 --> 05:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
been representative has been represented
 
05:49:03.830 --> 05:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
the vaccine Association may want to
 
05:49:05.830 --> 05:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
expand its business but this bill opens
 
05:49:07.750 --> 05:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
up a mechanism for for a state takeover
 
05:49:09.468 --> 05:49:09.478 align:start position:0%
of the purchase sale and distribution of
 
05:49:10.788 --> 05:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
countless numbers and types of
 
05:49:13.310 --> 05:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
biological products there is no other
 
05:49:16.548 --> 05:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
state that engages in a scheme of this
 
05:49:19.110 --> 05:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
type most concerning is that this bill
 
05:49:21.070 --> 05:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
opens the state for liability for
 
05:49:22.830 --> 05:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
injuries including disabilities and
 
05:49:25.190 --> 05:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
death from these biological products the
 
05:49:26.830 --> 05:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
state and manufacturers and others are
 
05:49:28.868 --> 05:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
shielded from liability for injury death
 
05:49:30.070 --> 05:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
caused by
 
05:49:33.150 --> 05:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines by the 1986 National childhood
 
05:49:35.350 --> 05:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury act but there is no
 
05:49:37.548 --> 05:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
immunity from liability when it comes to
 
05:49:40.030 --> 05:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
other biological products the risk is
 
05:49:42.190 --> 05:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
very great with these new and unproven
 
05:49:44.390 --> 05:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
monoclonal antibodies targeted newborn
 
05:49:46.868 --> 05:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
infants has anyone calculated the
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
liability against the state and
 
05:49:50.990 --> 05:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that would be for disability
 
05:49:53.110 --> 05:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
or death to these infants they certainly
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
should this should be reason enough to
 
05:49:58.430 --> 05:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
reject this unnecessary Bill remember
 
05:49:59.948 --> 05:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
doctors and hospitals are already
 
05:50:01.590 --> 05:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
purchasing these drugs as part of their
 
05:50:04.670 --> 05:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
routine drug purchases and we heard from
 
05:50:06.708 --> 05:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
Heidi koll here who represents the
 
05:50:08.310 --> 05:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
entire Health industry here in New
 
05:50:10.830 --> 05:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that these products are
 
05:50:12.708 --> 05:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
already being provided without any
 
05:50:15.070 --> 05:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
co-pay to the patients there's no need
 
05:50:15.080 --> 05:50:15.830 align:start position:0%
co-pay to the patients there's no need
for

05:50:15.830 --> 05:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:50:19.070 --> 05:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
change um this bill is not about whether
 
05:50:21.708 --> 05:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
RSV monoclonal antibodies are available
 
05:50:23.948 --> 05:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
they already are and it is not about
 
05:50:25.670 --> 05:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
whether you would choose these shots or
 
05:50:28.708 --> 05:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
not I support Choice believe it or not
 
05:50:30.788 --> 05:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
this bill would make a wholesale change
 
05:50:33.590 --> 05:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
to what type of drugs are purchased and
 
05:50:36.990 --> 05:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
sold by DHHS and the vaccine Association
 
05:50:39.070 --> 05:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
the vaccine Association was not created
 
05:50:41.230 --> 05:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
as a funding Agency for biologics or
 
05:50:44.030 --> 05:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
other Pharmaceuticals to treat or reduce
 
05:50:47.030 --> 05:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
symptoms the vaccine Association is not
 
05:50:49.030 --> 05:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
an all-purpose mechanism for drug
 
05:50:52.190 --> 05:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
purchases and sales yes indeed this
 
05:50:54.110 --> 05:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
change would allow for the purchase and
 
05:50:57.390 --> 05:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
substitution of mRNA shots in place of
 
05:51:00.150 --> 05:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
trusted antigen-based vaccines that have
 
05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
been used for decades and the mandates
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
on children would stay in
 
05:51:07.590 --> 05:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
place again um let's see I'm going to
 
05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
skip through here because you can read
 
05:51:10.990 --> 05:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
it all but I would like to point out to
 
05:51:12.628 --> 05:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
the legislatures and the public should
 
05:51:15.468 --> 05:51:15.478 align:start position:0%
be aware of important facts this nurse
 
05:51:18.110 --> 05:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
of simab is only has only been approved
 
05:51:21.030 --> 05:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
by the FDA since July of 2023 less than
 
05:51:23.708 --> 05:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
nine months ago there is really no track
 
05:51:26.510 --> 05:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
record on this drug for safety or RIS
 
05:51:28.868 --> 05:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
the RSV season runs from October to
 
05:51:31.270 --> 05:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
March so the very first season just
 
05:51:34.510 --> 05:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
ended last month um we don't have data
 
05:51:36.910 --> 05:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
on the efficacy yet and so fling
 
05:51:39.670 --> 05:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
incidents of RSV hospitalization the CDC
 
05:51:42.110 --> 05:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
always refers to RSV Associated because
 
05:51:44.788 --> 05:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
RSV itself doesn't send children to the
 
05:51:47.948 --> 05:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
hospital is the shot effective clinical
 
05:51:50.270 --> 05:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
trials only detected some reduction in
 
05:51:52.788 --> 05:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
symptoms for only 150 days after
 
05:51:55.030 --> 05:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
injection what about the use of this
 
05:51:56.910 --> 05:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
shot at the same time vaccines are given
 
05:51:59.468 --> 05:51:59.478 align:start position:0%
isn't that a concern the clinical trials
 
05:52:02.548 --> 05:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
and safety measures are scant but it re
 
05:52:05.310 --> 05:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
it appears that vaccines um the Adverse
 
05:52:07.468 --> 05:52:07.478 align:start position:0%
Events from these new shots are similar
 
05:52:09.430 --> 05:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
to what we experience with vaccines
 
05:52:11.628 --> 05:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
which of course can be disabling and
 
05:52:14.750 --> 05:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
even deadly um what is the system for
 
05:52:16.788 --> 05:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
tracking the adverse effects from these
 
05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
new monoclonal antibodies well you were
 
05:52:21.230 --> 05:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
advised here and you'll see a beer
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
statement I provided to you this is the
 
05:52:25.590 --> 05:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
federal government's program here if
 
05:52:27.910 --> 05:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
this RSV shot is given at the same time
 
05:52:31.310 --> 05:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
as a vaccine um it is being the public
 
05:52:34.230 --> 05:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
is being told to report it through veers
 
05:52:36.750 --> 05:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
and on here I'm going to note that it
 
05:52:39.110 --> 05:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
does say that nurse ofab is not a
 
05:52:40.310 --> 05:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine that's from the federal
 
05:52:41.548 --> 05:52:41.558 align:start position:0%
government so anybody wonders whether
 
05:52:43.548 --> 05:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
it's a vaccine or not it's not okay
 
05:52:47.670 --> 05:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
please start wrapping up um so um there
 
05:52:50.190 --> 05:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
is no adequate reporting system for for
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
injuries and there are other concerning
 
05:52:54.430 --> 05:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
audities about the bill why is
 
05:52:56.708 --> 05:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
biological product listed as a
 
05:52:59.708 --> 05:52:59.718 align:start position:0%
subcategory um the methodology DHHS
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
continues to refer to this as an ination
 
05:53:03.468 --> 05:53:03.478 align:start position:0%
the federal government is clear that it
 
05:53:06.590 --> 05:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
is not um it is a monocolonal antibody I
 
05:53:08.270 --> 05:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
would be very happy to take questions
 
05:53:10.548 --> 05:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Seth
 
05:53:12.310 --> 05:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:53:16.350 --> 05:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um so are you do you
 
05:53:18.910 --> 05:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
believe that somebody who would be
 
05:53:23.430 --> 05:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.030 --> 05:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
1986 uh law that gives immunity to
 
05:53:30.788 --> 05:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine companies uh for you know
 
05:53:32.788 --> 05:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions to patients if you're
 
05:53:35.590 --> 05:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
against that idea that you should also
 
05:53:38.350 --> 05:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
be against the idea of adding that for
 
05:53:40.910 --> 05:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
biological products as well is that what
 
05:53:43.310 --> 05:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
you're saying no that's not what I'm
 
05:53:45.510 --> 05:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
saying it's the federal law determines
 
05:53:47.430 --> 05:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
what products have immunity from
 
05:53:49.788 --> 05:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
liability um for all injuries and death
 
05:53:52.670 --> 05:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
and that is limited to vaccine products
 
05:53:54.310 --> 05:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
the federal government is very clear
 
05:53:56.590 --> 05:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
that these RSV shots are monal
 
05:53:58.350 --> 05:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
antibodies they are not vaccines so they
 
05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
don't enjoy that immunity from liability
 
05:54:03.030 --> 05:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay so when we have the state
 
05:54:05.350 --> 05:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
purchasing and holding inventory on
 
05:54:06.750 --> 05:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
these and it's being funed through the
 
05:54:09.030 --> 05:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association now they are the
 
05:54:11.390 --> 05:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
owners and the promoters and the sellers
 
05:54:13.270 --> 05:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
of this product and the liability would
 
05:54:15.788 --> 05:54:15.798 align:start position:0%
direct directly to them so if you have
 
05:54:18.590 --> 05:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
an infant who's been injured by these
 
05:54:21.830 --> 05:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
shots or some combination with vaccines
 
05:54:23.468 --> 05:54:23.478 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to go to the federal
 
05:54:25.670 --> 05:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury Compensation Program for
 
05:54:27.990 --> 05:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
compensation you will go directly to the
 
05:54:30.350 --> 05:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
state and the taxpayers of New Hampshire
 
05:54:32.468 --> 05:54:32.478 align:start position:0%
for disability and death cause to your
 
05:54:35.910 --> 05:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
newborn for these brand new experimental
 
05:54:41.948 --> 05:54:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:44.070 --> 05:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
questions see no other questions thank
 
05:54:57.030 --> 05:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:59.910 --> 05:54:59.920 align:start position:0%

05:55:13.350 --> 05:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
once again you've asked for five minutes
 
05:55:14.788 --> 05:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
if you could keep it to three I'd really
 
05:55:17.190 --> 05:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you good afternoon
 
05:55:19.350 --> 05:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative chairman McDonald it's
 
05:55:20.548 --> 05:55:20.558 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again I saw you just a
 
05:55:22.590 --> 05:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago thank you all for the time
 
05:55:24.310 --> 05:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
and I will not read specifically all of
 
05:55:26.468 --> 05:55:26.478 align:start position:0%
the words on here and please forgive my
 
05:55:28.070 --> 05:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
original the the first paragraph
 
05:55:29.830 --> 05:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
reflects the original and not the
 
05:55:32.468 --> 05:55:32.478 align:start position:0%
amended but further in the uh document I
 
05:55:35.390 --> 05:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
talk about the amended um the amended
 
05:55:37.990 --> 05:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
Bill uh so my name is Dr Suzanne tansky
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
I a practicing pediatrician at Dartmouth
 
05:55:41.868 --> 05:55:41.878 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock um Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical
 
05:55:43.628 --> 05:55:43.638 align:start position:0%
Center in Dartmouth Health children's
 
05:55:45.708 --> 05:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
I've been here as a resident for 19
 
05:55:47.030 --> 05:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
years and I've been a pediatrician for
 
05:55:49.150 --> 05:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
more than 25 years and you've talked a
 
05:55:51.390 --> 05:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
bit we've talked a bit about the the
 
05:55:53.788 --> 05:55:53.798 align:start position:0%
mechanism of what this B bill is I want
 
05:55:56.910 --> 05:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about the why RSV is a very
 
05:55:59.070 --> 05:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
common childhood infection it's an it's
 
05:56:01.628 --> 05:56:01.638 align:start position:0%
a CO common cold that all of us get over
 
05:56:04.190 --> 05:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
and over get throughout our LIF SP span
 
05:56:06.030 --> 05:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
generally speaking the first infection
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
you get when you're very small is the
 
05:56:10.468 --> 05:56:10.478 align:start position:0%
most severe pediatricians see hundreds
 
05:56:12.468 --> 05:56:12.478 align:start position:0%
of kids every single year who have
 
05:56:14.788 --> 05:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
severe RSV disease as a pediatrician
 
05:56:16.430 --> 05:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
I've taken care of hundreds and hundreds
 
05:56:19.270 --> 05:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
of children with RSV RSV in a little kid
 
05:56:21.468 --> 05:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
with a tiny little Airway they have so
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
much mucus so almost snot debris in
 
05:56:25.868 --> 05:56:25.878 align:start position:0%
their airways they struggle to breathe
 
05:56:27.788 --> 05:56:27.798 align:start position:0%
watching them as a parent as a doctor
 
05:56:30.070 --> 05:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's agonizing to watch these kids when
 
05:56:31.628 --> 05:56:31.638 align:start position:0%
the idea came forth that there was going
 
05:56:33.548 --> 05:56:33.558 align:start position:0%
to be a vaccine or an immunization
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
something to prevent severe RSV disease
 
05:56:39.070 --> 05:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
pediatricians around the world rejoiced
 
05:56:40.868 --> 05:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
indeed this came out just in July of
 
05:56:42.670 --> 05:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
last year and we were so thrilled
 
05:56:44.430 --> 05:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
because the opportunity to reduce the
 
05:56:47.190 --> 05:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
burden of disease by 80% the Studies
 
05:56:49.468 --> 05:56:49.478 align:start position:0%
have shown that we have 80% fewer
 
05:56:51.830 --> 05:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations from RSV and kids who
 
05:56:53.390 --> 05:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
come to the hospital for RSV we don't
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
have a lot to do for them we can give
 
05:56:58.430 --> 05:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
them oxygen we can give them fluids and
 
05:57:00.270 --> 05:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
we can give them TLC so we don't have a
 
05:57:01.948 --> 05:57:01.958 align:start position:0%
lot of things in our toolbox to help
 
05:57:03.788 --> 05:57:03.798 align:start position:0%
these kids except for Respiratory
 
05:57:05.468 --> 05:57:05.478 align:start position:0%
support so the idea that we've got
 
05:57:07.070 --> 05:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
something to protect protect them from
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
severe disease with a passive
 
05:57:10.590 --> 05:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
immunization this isn't immunization
 
05:57:12.750 --> 05:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
this is a passive immunization giving
 
05:57:14.788 --> 05:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
children antibodies so instead of a
 
05:57:16.590 --> 05:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine like representative merchin was
 
05:57:18.830 --> 05:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
saying where a vaccine will stimulate
 
05:57:20.510 --> 05:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
your immune system to make your own
 
05:57:22.468 --> 05:57:22.478 align:start position:0%
antibody this is giving the baby the
 
05:57:24.708 --> 05:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
antibody directly it doesn't last very
 
05:57:26.350 --> 05:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
long it lasts between three and five
 
05:57:28.390 --> 05:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
months but it's very effective we have
 
05:57:29.750 --> 05:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
many other things that we use passive
 
05:57:31.750 --> 05:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
immunity for as well like rabies
 
05:57:33.548 --> 05:57:33.558 align:start position:0%
imunoglobulin is another passive
 
05:57:35.548 --> 05:57:35.558 align:start position:0%
immunity if you come in contact with
 
05:57:37.628 --> 05:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
someone an animal that might have rabies
 
05:57:40.230 --> 05:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
you get rabies imunoglobulin so there's
 
05:57:41.628 --> 05:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
other things that have precedent with
 
05:57:43.510 --> 05:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
that we use as imunoglobulin or
 
05:57:45.948 --> 05:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
monoclonal antibodies so this is a tried
 
05:57:47.910 --> 05:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
and truee Technology we just have the
 
05:57:50.190 --> 05:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
very first opportunity to present it to
 
05:57:52.310 --> 05:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
lots of babies in the past there was a
 
05:57:54.110 --> 05:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
previous version of a monoclonal
 
05:57:56.750 --> 05:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
antibody for babies with severe with um
 
05:57:59.030 --> 05:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
prematurity it's called cagis had to be
 
05:58:01.070 --> 05:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
given as a monthly injection tens of
 
05:58:02.910 --> 05:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars per baby so it was
 
05:58:04.468 --> 05:58:04.478 align:start position:0%
really limited to only a certain
 
05:58:06.590 --> 05:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
population who were eligible for that
 
05:58:08.468 --> 05:58:08.478 align:start position:0%
and this makes that not needed any
 
05:58:10.070 --> 05:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
longer because it has more persistent
 
05:58:12.350 --> 05:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
protection so this is a life-saving
 
05:58:14.590 --> 05:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
immunization we had tremendous demand
 
05:58:16.430 --> 05:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
for this we had Parents calling on the
 
05:58:18.190 --> 05:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
phone asking when are you going to have
 
05:58:20.350 --> 05:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
it when can I have it for my baby and
 
05:58:21.948 --> 05:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
the phone calls started as soon as the
 
05:58:23.868 --> 05:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
media let let it be known that we had
 
05:58:26.548 --> 05:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
protection for babies for RSV which
 
05:58:29.430 --> 05:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
again can be very severe in little kids
 
05:58:32.190 --> 05:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
so this technical change will make it so
 
05:58:34.510 --> 05:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
much easier for parents to get this very
 
05:58:36.430 --> 05:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
desired immunization during the rest
 
05:58:38.990 --> 05:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
season and I fully support uh Senate
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
bill as amended 559 so that we can make
 
05:58:43.548 --> 05:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
sure that we provide this recommended
 
05:58:45.548 --> 05:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
needed helpful immunization for our
 
05:58:47.350 --> 05:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
youngest babies at the highest risk and
 
05:58:48.910 --> 05:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy to answer questions
 
05:58:50.948 --> 05:58:50.958 align:start position:0%
because I'm I've been living and
 
05:58:52.350 --> 05:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
breathing this for months and months and
 
05:58:55.788 --> 05:58:55.798 align:start position:0%
months thank you any
 
05:58:58.548 --> 05:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative uh palaza
 
05:59:01.190 --> 05:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
and then representative Seth King thank
 
05:59:03.910 --> 05:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr Jen thank you for taking my
 
05:59:07.548 --> 05:59:07.558 align:start position:0%
question uh is it that is it true that
 
05:59:10.190 --> 05:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's already available to parents so
 
05:59:13.150 --> 05:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
what exactly this bill changes this bill
 
05:59:14.708 --> 05:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
makes it a whole lot easier as we heard
 
05:59:16.510 --> 05:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
earlier this is available on the
 
05:59:19.070 --> 05:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
commercial Market but as as noted the
 
05:59:21.468 --> 05:59:21.478 align:start position:0%
the ability for us to have it in one
 
05:59:24.190 --> 05:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
population makes things much much easier
 
05:59:25.868 --> 05:59:25.878 align:start position:0%
with every other product that we have
 
05:59:27.310 --> 05:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
for immunization in the state of New
 
05:59:28.708 --> 05:59:28.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire's ahead of the
 
05:59:30.510 --> 05:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
game we've got Universal immunization
 
05:59:32.270 --> 05:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
practices so that it doesn't matter if
 
05:59:34.110 --> 05:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
you have insurance not Insurance what
 
05:59:35.990 --> 05:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
that product is I can just go in the
 
05:59:37.510 --> 05:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
refrigerator I can get the vaccine
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's being requested by the parent and
 
05:59:40.948 --> 05:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
administer That vaccine without having
 
05:59:42.350 --> 05:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
to worry about anything it's really
 
05:59:44.350 --> 05:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
simple with having to have two
 
05:59:46.270 --> 05:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
populations I needed a vaccines for
 
05:59:48.590 --> 05:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
children bucket and a bucket for
 
05:59:50.910 --> 05:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
commercial vaccines the logistics of
 
05:59:52.270 --> 05:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
that were really difficult because we
 
05:59:54.468 --> 05:59:54.478 align:start position:0%
had access problems the state was much
 
05:59:56.510 --> 05:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
easier to procure it it was a lot easier
 
05:59:58.670 --> 05:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
to get a supply from the state than it
 
06:00:00.390 --> 06:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
was to buy it commercially on the market
 
06:00:01.750 --> 06:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
several of my colleagues in private
 
06:00:03.708 --> 06:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
practice couldn't obtain any
 
06:00:05.708 --> 06:00:05.718 align:start position:0%
commercially available vaccine because
 
06:00:07.750 --> 06:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
of some some shortages and so they were
 
06:00:09.310 --> 06:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
not able to offer this desired
 
06:00:10.468 --> 06:00:10.478 align:start position:0%
immunization to their patient
 
06:00:13.590 --> 06:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
populations so making this level so that
 
06:00:16.590 --> 06:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
there's one way that that we pay for it
 
06:00:18.910 --> 06:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
really creates a an equity equation so
 
06:00:20.430 --> 06:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
that we can offer to everyone who wants
 
06:00:22.788 --> 06:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
it great question thank you
 
06:00:25.030 --> 06:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
06:00:29.350 --> 06:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
chair um would you be able to rebut any
 
06:00:31.430 --> 06:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
of the arguments that the previous
 
06:00:33.708 --> 06:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
testifier made um about the concerns
 
06:00:35.310 --> 06:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
about putting the state on the hook
 
06:00:37.990 --> 06:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
financially for
 
06:00:42.468 --> 06:00:42.478 align:start position:0%
lawsuits um anything like that thank you
 
06:00:45.590 --> 06:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think I have the legal
 
06:00:47.430 --> 06:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
understanding to know about the limits
 
06:00:50.030 --> 06:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
of liability um that would not be my
 
06:00:51.750 --> 06:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
understanding but I am not a lawyer I am
 
06:00:54.310 --> 06:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
a pediatrician and I will I will stay in
 
06:00:58.468 --> 06:00:58.478 align:start position:0%
my lane for that one um but um this
 
06:01:00.430 --> 06:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
again passive immunization to answer a
 
06:01:01.390 --> 06:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
couple of the other questions passive
 
06:01:03.510 --> 06:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
immunization has been around for a very
 
06:01:06.310 --> 06:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
long time and this technology is is
 
06:01:08.030 --> 06:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
again a huge advancement and it's
 
06:01:10.030 --> 06:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily well tolerated we we
 
06:01:11.868 --> 06:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
don't see fever we don't see side
 
06:01:14.030 --> 06:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
effects I for myself in my practice I
 
06:01:17.670 --> 06:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe we made any um uh concerns
 
06:01:20.510 --> 06:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
to medat which is the tool for biologics
 
06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
or to
 
06:01:26.150 --> 06:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
Bears representative palazov uh thank
 
06:01:28.110 --> 06:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my second
 
06:01:31.430 --> 06:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
question when newshire can expect uh
 
06:01:33.910 --> 06:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
some data on efficiency of those
 
06:01:36.708 --> 06:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines because uh there already been
 
06:01:40.110 --> 06:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
administered to kids so when we see like
 
06:01:44.750 --> 06:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
if it helps with uh RSV cases uh I I'm
 
06:01:46.708 --> 06:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
eager for that as well so as I said in
 
06:01:48.548 --> 06:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
the original studies that were conducted
 
06:01:50.150 --> 06:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
there was an 80% reduction in
 
06:01:51.708 --> 06:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and severe disease from
 
06:01:55.430 --> 06:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
RSV and I am certain that the CDC is
 
06:01:57.030 --> 06:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
actually actively collecting that data
 
06:01:59.110 --> 06:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
Nationwide so we'll have better numbers
 
06:02:01.070 --> 06:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the Nationwide population
 
06:02:03.350 --> 06:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
disappointingly we were intending to be
 
06:02:05.150 --> 06:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
able to provide this immunization up to
 
06:02:07.070 --> 06:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
the age of 8 months of age so really
 
06:02:08.468 --> 06:02:08.478 align:start position:0%
getting kids through that first year of
 
06:02:10.110 --> 06:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
Life the respiratory season again being
 
06:02:12.708 --> 06:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
about 5 months um and because of supply
 
06:02:14.670 --> 06:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
issues we really only got to immunize
 
06:02:16.190 --> 06:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
kids up to about four months which is
 
06:02:18.510 --> 06:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
still great uh but we will have we will
 
06:02:20.788 --> 06:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
be having some data on that as well
 
06:02:23.628 --> 06:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank you thank
 
06:02:30.708 --> 06:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:34.468 --> 06:02:34.478 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Kate pry
 
06:02:38.150 --> 06:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:40.510 --> 06:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
she still here oh there she okay I'm
 
06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:46.670 --> 06:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
organized you have a testimony to pass I
 
06:02:48.190 --> 06:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
do have written testimony that I will
 
06:02:50.750 --> 06:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
leave with you and testimony from a few
 
06:02:53.830 --> 06:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
other Advocates my name is Kate fry from
 
06:02:56.548 --> 06:02:56.558 align:start position:0%
new futures um we are as I've asked the
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
others if you could keep it to three
 
06:02:59.510 --> 06:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm going to be able to do that
 
06:03:03.230 --> 06:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
perfectly so as you heard from others
 
06:03:05.270 --> 06:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is about the vaccine
 
06:03:07.590 --> 06:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
Association it changes the definition
 
06:03:10.270 --> 06:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
within the vaccine Association that
 
06:03:14.110 --> 06:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
helps ensure the access of all vaccines
 
06:03:16.070 --> 06:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
that are on the New Hampshire schedule
 
06:03:18.910 --> 06:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
to be free of charge to parents this is
 
06:03:22.788 --> 06:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
this program is um a very important
 
06:03:24.868 --> 06:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
Nationwide of copied by many other
 
06:03:27.670 --> 06:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
states in the nation um and it only
 
06:03:30.708 --> 06:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
affects that definition it does not add
 
06:03:33.350 --> 06:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
the RSV immunization to the vaccination
 
06:03:36.548 --> 06:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
schedule it remains option for Grand
 
06:03:38.948 --> 06:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
State families it's about the uh choice
 
06:03:41.670 --> 06:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
for parents but one thing I I will leave
 
06:03:43.750 --> 06:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
this testimony that's more comprehensive
 
06:03:45.350 --> 06:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
but you had heard from a previous
 
06:03:48.948 --> 06:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
speaker that um infants with RSV rarely
 
06:03:51.830 --> 06:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
go to the hospital um and actually an
 
06:03:54.350 --> 06:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
estimated 58,000 to 880,000 children
 
06:03:57.030 --> 06:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
under uh 5 years old are hospitalized
 
06:04:00.350 --> 06:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
each year due to RSV and if I can I'm
 
06:04:02.910 --> 06:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
just going to share with you quickly um
 
06:04:05.708 --> 06:04:05.718 align:start position:0%
a testimony I received today from an um
 
06:04:09.070 --> 06:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
a mom who said she supports uh this bill
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh her daughter who's now 24 almost died
 
06:04:14.750 --> 06:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
of RSV when she was only a month old we
 
06:04:16.270 --> 06:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
noticed she was having difficulty
 
06:04:18.830 --> 06:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
breathing and keeping anything down we
 
06:04:20.750 --> 06:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
took her to the doctors and they
 
06:04:22.750 --> 06:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
realized um they had to send her to
 
06:04:25.030 --> 06:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
Boston Children's Hospital immediately
 
06:04:27.948 --> 06:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
because something was very wrong upon
 
06:04:29.708 --> 06:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
arriving to the hospital they noticed
 
06:04:32.030 --> 06:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
notice she was not breathing for moments
 
06:04:34.350 --> 06:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
in time obviously this was very alarming
 
06:04:36.990 --> 06:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
she had to go to the end um
 
06:04:39.708 --> 06:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
niku um the doctors ended up doing a
 
06:04:42.030 --> 06:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
spinal tap and a nasal sve on the brand
 
06:04:43.830 --> 06:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
new baby on her brand new baby and
 
06:04:46.468 --> 06:04:46.478 align:start position:0%
discovered she had RSV uh because of
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
that she was placed into an oxygen gent
 
06:04:50.590 --> 06:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
to help her breathe all of this could
 
06:04:53.070 --> 06:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
have been prevented if this science was
 
06:04:56.548 --> 06:04:56.558 align:start position:0%
available when um this young woman was a
 
06:04:59.708 --> 06:04:59.718 align:start position:0%
uh baby so um I encourage you to read
 
06:05:01.350 --> 06:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
that testimony I also have testimony
 
06:05:04.030 --> 06:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
from a pediatrician on the importance
 
06:05:05.708 --> 06:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
but I think it's really important to
 
06:05:08.150 --> 06:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
focus on what this bill does and set
 
06:05:12.670 --> 06:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:17.230 --> 06:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
do thank you any
 
06:05:20.190 --> 06:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative Palazo thank
 
06:05:22.750 --> 06:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
06:05:25.310 --> 06:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
question so following up on your last
 
06:05:28.948 --> 06:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
line uh so would you be comfortable if
 
06:05:32.390 --> 06:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
we limit this bill only to uh this uh
 
06:05:36.590 --> 06:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
monoclonal antibody uh technology
 
06:05:41.468 --> 06:05:41.478 align:start position:0%
and uh if we ever Pro develop a food
 
06:05:45.110 --> 06:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
that provides ammonization through some
 
06:05:48.708 --> 06:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
mRNA technology would that that
 
06:05:52.070 --> 06:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
technology uh be according to the
 
06:05:55.390 --> 06:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
definition of biological product as it
 
06:05:59.510 --> 06:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
defined in this bill so can you clarify
 
06:06:02.868 --> 06:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
on what it does and what it does not I
 
06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
am supportive of this bill that defin
 
06:06:07.990 --> 06:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
signes within the New Hampshire vaccine
 
06:06:11.230 --> 06:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
Association law so that it can cover
 
06:06:14.548 --> 06:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
every child regardless of whether it's a
 
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
monal antibody for RSV or traditional
 
06:06:20.990 --> 06:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine this way they can be purchased
 
06:06:22.708 --> 06:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
under the vaccine
 
06:06:25.230 --> 06:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
Association and if parents choose to
 
06:06:27.548 --> 06:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
have that vaccine for their child they
 
06:06:30.910 --> 06:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
can do so it has nothing to do with mRNA
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
or I I think you mentioned something
 
06:06:35.110 --> 06:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
about food and vaccine it is very
 
06:06:37.070 --> 06:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
specific specific to the vaccine
 
06:06:39.708 --> 06:06:39.718 align:start position:0%
Association law and the B the business
 
06:06:42.110 --> 06:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
structure of how we purchase vaccines to
 
06:06:46.070 --> 06:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
provide universally follow up so follow
 
06:06:48.868 --> 06:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
up I I'm just not comfortable because uh
 
06:06:54.070 --> 06:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
on line 14 page one it says uh any
 
06:06:57.628 --> 06:06:57.638 align:start position:0%
product including uh antibody so it
 
06:06:59.628 --> 06:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't say antibody in traditional
 
06:07:02.628 --> 06:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
vaccines it says any biological product
 
06:07:05.990 --> 06:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
so when I see the word any it it opens
 
06:07:08.750 --> 06:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
up to any future technology as we heard
 
06:07:11.350 --> 06:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
in some previous testimonies so there
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
are several people who worked on this
 
06:07:14.750 --> 06:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
bill I do believe the Department of
 
06:07:16.310 --> 06:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
Insurance assisted too with this
 
06:07:18.390 --> 06:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
definition I feel very comfortable that
 
06:07:20.270 --> 06:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses what we needed to do
 
06:07:22.788 --> 06:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
so every child in the state who chooses
 
06:07:24.390 --> 06:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh whose parents choose to have an
 
06:07:28.070 --> 06:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
RSV uh vaccine have access to
 
06:07:30.868 --> 06:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
it other
 
06:07:39.990 --> 06:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:41.910 --> 06:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is AA Hawks from
 
06:07:47.150 --> 06:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:50.468 --> 06:07:50.478 align:start position:0%
Society and you asked for three minutes
 
06:07:53.430 --> 06:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
I will do my best to keep it less good
 
06:07:55.110 --> 06:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
06:07:56.750 --> 06:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Ava
 
06:07:58.430 --> 06:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hawks and I the director of advocacy for
 
06:08:00.708 --> 06:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Medical Society uh we
 
06:08:03.708 --> 06:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
support Seno 559 I'm not going to read
 
06:08:05.510 --> 06:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
my testimony word for word I'll just
 
06:08:07.270 --> 06:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
summarize um as you've already heard
 
06:08:08.670 --> 06:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
today this bill makes a simple yet
 
06:08:11.468 --> 06:08:11.478 align:start position:0%
impactful technical change to RSA
 
06:08:13.750 --> 06:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
126q uh the statute that governs the New
 
06:08:15.430 --> 06:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine association's ability
 
06:08:17.350 --> 06:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
to receive payment or assessments from
 
06:08:19.270 --> 06:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
payers for immunizations offered to
 
06:08:20.708 --> 06:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
commercially insured children in New
 
06:08:23.310 --> 06:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um our providers pediatricians
 
06:08:25.110 --> 06:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
in particular appreciate the benefit
 
06:08:27.510 --> 06:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
that the vfc program provides to our
 
06:08:29.190 --> 06:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
state's Children and Families as a
 
06:08:31.350 --> 06:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
program affords all children under 19
 
06:08:33.948 --> 06:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
access um to all routinely recommended
 
06:08:35.430 --> 06:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines at no cost to the healthcare
 
06:08:37.868 --> 06:08:37.878 align:start position:0%
care provider or the family uh sential
 
06:08:39.548 --> 06:08:39.558 align:start position:0%
559 would increase access to
 
06:08:42.670 --> 06:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
immunizations admin administered through
 
06:08:44.270 --> 06:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination that have been approved by
 
06:08:45.628 --> 06:08:45.638 align:start position:0%
the FDA and would further allow
 
06:08:48.110 --> 06:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
providers to offer certain immunizations
 
06:08:50.430 --> 06:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
such as Nur camab which I think I got
 
06:08:52.708 --> 06:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
correct uh that prevents RSV and babies
 
06:08:55.030 --> 06:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
and toddlers so I'll I'll stop there for
 
06:08:56.430 --> 06:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
those reasons the medical society
 
06:08:58.830 --> 06:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
supports this bill I am happy to take
 
06:09:00.628 --> 06:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
questions but based on the line of
 
06:09:01.910 --> 06:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
questioning today I will remind the
 
06:09:04.190 --> 06:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee that I am not a lawyer nor a
 
06:09:06.270 --> 06:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
physician but if there are questions
 
06:09:08.270 --> 06:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
that require a physician's response I
 
06:09:13.030 --> 06:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
can get that okay thank you yeah any
 
06:09:20.830 --> 06:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:23.390 --> 06:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Abby

06:09:34.110 --> 06:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:36.430 --> 06:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
Services thank thank you good afternoon
 
06:09:39.350 --> 06:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
Abby I'm Abby Rogers um legislative Len
 
06:09:41.230 --> 06:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
for the division Public Health Services
 
06:09:43.788 --> 06:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
um and I'm with anarie
 
06:09:46.590 --> 06:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
mccu good afternoon I'm an Mar mccu I'm
 
06:09:49.468 --> 06:09:49.478 align:start position:0%
the immunization section chief I just
 
06:09:52.390 --> 06:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to um also state that the
 
06:09:54.190 --> 06:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
department has the authority to purchase
 
06:09:57.230 --> 06:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
and distribute um immunizations under
 
06:10:00.548 --> 06:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire RSA 141c 17A which
 
06:10:02.230 --> 06:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
specifies the commissioner May purchase
 
06:10:05.350 --> 06:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
and distribute antitoxin serums vaccine
 
06:10:08.230 --> 06:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
immunizing agents antibiotics and other
 
06:10:09.830 --> 06:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical agents which the
 
06:10:11.990 --> 06:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner deems advisable to prevent
 
06:10:14.310 --> 06:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
prepare for or respond to an outbreak of
 
06:10:16.750 --> 06:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
communic disease or other serious threat
 
06:10:19.510 --> 06:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
of Public Health so under that Authority
 
06:10:23.070 --> 06:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
the program was able to procure nurse
 
06:10:26.110 --> 06:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
avab but only for our vaccine for
 
06:10:29.070 --> 06:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
children elig eligible children and this
 
06:10:32.750 --> 06:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
was due to the fact that currently RSA
 
06:10:37.430 --> 06:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
126 Q would not allow for the assessment
 
06:10:38.670 --> 06:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire vaccine
 
06:10:40.830 --> 06:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
Association and subsequent reimbursement
 
06:10:43.030 --> 06:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
to the department for this product so
 
06:10:45.948 --> 06:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
we're in a really difficult place the
 
06:10:49.190 --> 06:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
CDC supplied an allocation of this new
 
06:10:52.070 --> 06:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
immunization to us yet we were only able
 
06:10:54.830 --> 06:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
to give it out to a fraction of the
 
06:10:57.270 --> 06:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
population as a result the providers
 
06:10:59.270 --> 06:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
were in a very uncomfortable position
 
06:11:00.910 --> 06:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
they had to decide whether they could
 
06:11:03.868 --> 06:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
afford to buy and Bill for this product
 
06:11:06.628 --> 06:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
I I had heard anec toally that um there
 
06:11:09.350 --> 06:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
were families that actually were charged
 
06:11:12.310 --> 06:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
for the purchase of the product because
 
06:11:14.750 --> 06:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms to go ahead and Bill for
 
06:11:17.030 --> 06:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
it weren't quite established yet because
 
06:11:19.230 --> 06:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
it was a newly evolving situation with
 
06:11:21.390 --> 06:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
the product coming out very quickly
 
06:11:23.990 --> 06:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
during the midst of our SV season so we
 
06:11:25.868 --> 06:11:25.878 align:start position:0%
were really placed in a very difficult
 
06:11:30.708 --> 06:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
position so this um Senate Bill 559
 
06:11:33.190 --> 06:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
really does fix that it allows for that
 
06:11:36.150 --> 06:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
biological product so that it allows for
 
06:11:38.270 --> 06:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanism to support New
 
06:11:40.270 --> 06:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire immunization programs
 
06:11:43.868 --> 06:11:43.878 align:start position:0%
Universal purchase of the immunization
 
06:11:45.910 --> 06:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
so that all children regardless of their
 
06:11:48.548 --> 06:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
insurance status or ability to pay could
 
06:11:50.868 --> 06:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
receive these asip recommended
 
06:11:53.868 --> 06:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
immunizations at no cost to the patient
 
06:11:56.788 --> 06:11:56.798 align:start position:0%
family caregiver or provider so this is
 
06:11:58.788 --> 06:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
just really good health care to allow
 
06:12:01.430 --> 06:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
the accessibility of the immunization
 
06:12:03.230 --> 06:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
we're in a very difficult place we're
 
06:12:05.230 --> 06:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
not able to um provide it to the
 
06:12:08.590 --> 06:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
providers only 50% of our providers who
 
06:12:10.310 --> 06:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
were enrolled with our vaccine for
 
06:12:13.150 --> 06:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
children program offered nureva map
 
06:12:14.670 --> 06:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
because they were really placed in this
 
06:12:18.150 --> 06:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
dilemma do I give it to the vfc eligible
 
06:12:20.670 --> 06:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
kids only which would be our Medicaid
 
06:12:23.350 --> 06:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
uninsured underinsured Alaskan native or
 
06:12:27.030 --> 06:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
American Indians or do I have to try to
 
06:12:29.150 --> 06:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
figure out another way to try to get
 
06:12:30.430 --> 06:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
this for the commercially insured
 
06:12:32.468 --> 06:12:32.478 align:start position:0%
children and frankly half of them just
 
06:12:34.948 --> 06:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
decided I'm not going to offer it at all
 
06:12:37.150 --> 06:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
and that was very difficult we had
 
06:12:38.990 --> 06:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
families that were calling trying to
 
06:12:41.628 --> 06:12:41.638 align:start position:0%
find this product um there were families
 
06:12:43.628 --> 06:12:43.638 align:start position:0%
that actually went over the the line
 
06:12:45.270 --> 06:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
into Massachusetts and were able to
 
06:12:47.670 --> 06:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
obtain it there um I know that there are
 
06:12:49.628 --> 06:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
other vaccine associations that don't
 
06:12:52.788 --> 06:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
have this difficulty because their um
 
06:12:56.788 --> 06:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
language of their vaccine Association um
 
06:12:59.390 --> 06:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
rsas are not as restrictive as New
 
06:13:01.390 --> 06:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's is so this is really kind of
 
06:13:04.868 --> 06:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
a unique problem to just a few States um
 
06:13:06.788 --> 06:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
that have this difficulty and we would
 
06:13:08.350 --> 06:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
really like to be able to offer this
 
06:13:11.830 --> 06:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:14.430 --> 06:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
program thank you um I just wanted to
 
06:13:16.590 --> 06:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
add a couple of things um just to let
 
06:13:18.030 --> 06:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
the committee know that this is not just
 
06:13:20.070 --> 06:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire unique problem this
 
06:13:21.830 --> 06:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
there are many stage grappling with this
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
and trying to expand their statutes to
 
06:13:26.830 --> 06:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
to um be able to accommodate this new
 
06:13:28.468 --> 06:13:28.478 align:start position:0%
technology because based on the
 
06:13:31.310 --> 06:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
definition of aine and 126q monoclonals
 
06:13:33.390 --> 06:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
do not fit into that so when when we
 
06:13:34.830 --> 06:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
were working with stakeholders on how to
 
06:13:36.270 --> 06:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
fix this problem we thought well maybe
 
06:13:37.948 --> 06:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
we'll extand expand the definition of
 
06:13:40.190 --> 06:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine to include that uh that was not
 
06:13:41.548 --> 06:13:41.558 align:start position:0%
something that the Senate wanted to do
 
06:13:42.910 --> 06:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
they were more comfortable with adding
 
06:13:45.350 --> 06:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
biological product um just to share also
 
06:13:47.468 --> 06:13:47.478 align:start position:0%
with the committee that in our uh work
 
06:13:49.830 --> 06:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
with the um Association of imization
 
06:13:53.190 --> 06:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
managers and um ASO that we work with
 
06:13:55.030 --> 06:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
that it is really important it has been
 
06:13:56.910 --> 06:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
emphasized to State Health departments
 
06:13:59.590 --> 06:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
that nomenclature around these products
 
06:14:02.190 --> 06:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
are try to be standardized whether we
 
06:14:04.628 --> 06:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
call them um biological products
 
06:14:06.190 --> 06:14:06.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines like products they are not
 
06:14:07.468 --> 06:14:07.478 align:start position:0%
vaccines they're referred to as
 
06:14:09.788 --> 06:14:09.798 align:start position:0%
immunizations but in order to align with
 
06:14:12.350 --> 06:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
Federal payer statutes recognition on
 
06:14:15.548 --> 06:14:15.558 align:start position:0%
the federal level um they're not to be
 
06:14:17.468 --> 06:14:17.478 align:start position:0%
they're not vaccines or immunizations
 
06:14:19.070 --> 06:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
but they are biological products and
 
06:14:21.830 --> 06:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
they also are vaccine like products so I
 
06:14:23.628 --> 06:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
understand that um the federal at the
 
06:14:27.230 --> 06:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
federal level the um uh vaccine injury
 
06:14:28.788 --> 06:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
Compensation Program is looking to add
 
06:14:30.310 --> 06:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
these products I think that was alluded
 
06:14:33.150 --> 06:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
to before um this is a product uh
 
06:14:35.590 --> 06:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
licensed by the FDA so
 
06:14:37.548 --> 06:14:37.558 align:start position:0%
um instead of reporting any kind of
 
06:14:39.230 --> 06:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
adverse effect if you would a vaccine to
 
06:14:41.548 --> 06:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
vs this would be reported to the fda's
 
06:14:45.510 --> 06:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
medat um if if a child were to receive a
 
06:14:48.750 --> 06:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination um with a monoclonal then
 
06:14:50.310 --> 06:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
you would could report it to vs because
 
06:14:51.830 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
it encompasses that vaccine but it
 
06:14:53.628 --> 06:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
really is medwatch and it's sort of
 
06:14:56.270 --> 06:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
evolving if you will so as Amry said
 
06:14:58.270 --> 06:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
this is a technical fix this is allowing
 
06:15:00.708 --> 06:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
the vaccine Association to um allow the
 
06:15:02.230 --> 06:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
commercially assured to have this
 
06:15:03.750 --> 06:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
product and right now there's not parity
 
06:15:05.190 --> 06:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
between the Medicaid population and the
 
06:15:07.230 --> 06:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
commercially insured so it is truly a
 
06:15:09.590 --> 06:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
technical fix that um you know we hope
 
06:15:11.510 --> 06:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
that can move forward as RSV season
 
06:15:13.708 --> 06:15:13.718 align:start position:0%
approaches and people place orders for
 
06:15:15.510 --> 06:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
these medications in the fall it really
 
06:15:18.628 --> 06:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
does affect infant as Dr tansky said you
 
06:15:21.750 --> 06:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
know really newborn you know under year
 
06:15:23.628 --> 06:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
one year old when the devastating
 
06:15:26.270 --> 06:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
effects of RSV and hospitalizations are
 
06:15:28.110 --> 06:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
not only impactful to that child but
 
06:15:31.430 --> 06:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
also to Medicaid into you know hospital
 
06:15:34.150 --> 06:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
um admissions um I do believe it was
 
06:15:36.990 --> 06:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
either last year the year before um some
 
06:15:38.430 --> 06:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
states had declared a public health
 
06:15:40.230 --> 06:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
emergencies because their beds were F
 
06:15:42.670 --> 06:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
due to RSB patients so it really is a
 
06:15:44.350 --> 06:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
problem that needs to be addressed and
 
06:15:45.628 --> 06:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
um we're happy to answer further
 
06:15:47.190 --> 06:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
questions but just wanted to kind of
 
06:15:48.910 --> 06:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
level set on that it's not a New
 
06:15:50.390 --> 06:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unique problem right now with
 
06:15:51.628 --> 06:15:51.638 align:start position:0%
trying to get this these new
 
06:15:53.670 --> 06:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
technologies identified in statute and
 
06:15:56.270 --> 06:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
accepted thank you representative Lon uh
 
06:15:58.150 --> 06:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you very
 
06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
much uh sorry I've been running back and
 
06:16:03.070 --> 06:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
forth to the Senate um so my question is
 
06:16:05.868 --> 06:16:05.878 align:start position:0%
if um are you aware that this sort of
 
06:16:10.030 --> 06:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
payer lag and the and the approval lag
 
06:16:12.430 --> 06:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
is something that exists throughout all
 
06:16:14.190 --> 06:16:14.200 align:start position:0%
sorts of different therapies including
 
06:16:16.430 --> 06:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
life-saving therapies and that usually
 
06:16:18.868 --> 06:16:18.878 align:start position:0%
there is a lag between availability and
 
06:16:22.110 --> 06:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
before full payer coverage this is
 
06:16:24.430 --> 06:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
standard in medic medicine yeah I you
 
06:16:25.948 --> 06:16:25.958 align:start position:0%
know I'm just familiar with this
 
06:16:27.990 --> 06:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
particular issue that I know that um it
 
06:16:30.070 --> 06:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
was represented that um claims could be
 
06:16:31.868 --> 06:16:31.878 align:start position:0%
filed for patients that have commercial
 
06:16:33.310 --> 06:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
insurance but that is still parents
 
06:16:35.628 --> 06:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
paying out of pocket for
 
06:16:37.230 --> 06:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
the cost of the drug and then waiting to
 
06:16:39.150 --> 06:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed um so you know we're
 
06:16:40.948 --> 06:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
trying to solve this problem but I can't
 
06:16:44.230 --> 06:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
answer that further to on the broader
 
06:16:47.670 --> 06:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
scope if I can further elaborate um yes
 
06:16:49.628 --> 06:16:49.638 align:start position:0%
even though there's there may be a payer
 
06:16:52.708 --> 06:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
leg um Universal purchasing solves many
 
06:16:56.590 --> 06:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
more issues than that um because the
 
06:16:59.150 --> 06:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
first off the product is very expensive
 
06:17:04.150 --> 06:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
so um under the contract with the CDC
 
06:17:07.510 --> 06:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
the purchase would be $395 per each dose
 
06:17:10.190 --> 06:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
as compared to on the market private
 
06:17:14.468 --> 06:17:14.478 align:start position:0%
cost of $519 per dose so it's an extreme
 
06:17:18.310 --> 06:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
um cost savings but there's also the
 
06:17:21.190 --> 06:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
difficulty in being able to you know
 
06:17:24.310 --> 06:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
decide okay this child is a vfc eligible
 
06:17:26.788 --> 06:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
child I I need to pay for it and take it
 
06:17:29.468 --> 06:17:29.478 align:start position:0%
from this inventory this child is a
 
06:17:31.150 --> 06:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
commercially insured I need to go ahead
 
06:17:33.390 --> 06:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
and take it from this inventory so it
 
06:17:35.510 --> 06:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
goes deeper and Beyond
 
06:17:39.230 --> 06:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
um any payer Gap it goes to the
 
06:17:41.590 --> 06:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
logistics and the feasibility and Clinic
 
06:17:44.350 --> 06:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
flow um on you know on a busy birthing
 
06:17:47.150 --> 06:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
unit um you know nurses are not going to
 
06:17:49.110 --> 06:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
be able to take the time to to be able
 
06:17:51.070 --> 06:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
to really sort out and go to the record
 
06:17:53.350 --> 06:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
and find out what insurance they have so
 
06:17:56.510 --> 06:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
it just goes beyond a payer
 
06:17:59.628 --> 06:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
Gap I'll say yeah no I think that's it I
 
06:18:01.270 --> 06:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
mean it's heart valves too I mean heart
 
06:18:02.750 --> 06:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
valves will directly save a life but
 
06:18:04.190 --> 06:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's this challenge too so it's not
 
06:18:07.070 --> 06:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
unique but thank you representative
 
06:18:10.190 --> 06:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
06:18:12.468 --> 06:18:12.478 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I I've heard a
 
06:18:14.390 --> 06:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
lot about
 
06:18:17.468 --> 06:18:17.478 align:start position:0%
RSV and that correct me if I'm wrong if
 
06:18:20.990 --> 06:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
this bill was mostly written to allow
 
06:18:24.430 --> 06:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:24.440 --> 06:18:26.628 align:start position:0%
 
RSV

06:18:26.628 --> 06:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
RSV
 
06:18:31.190 --> 06:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
um access to um the vaccine but so if
 
06:18:34.830 --> 06:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
that's the case then why use or create
 
06:18:37.830 --> 06:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
the term biological product and instead
 
06:18:41.110 --> 06:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
of just keeping this specific to
 
06:18:45.390 --> 06:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
RSV why opening this up to this big
 
06:18:47.910 --> 06:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
umbrella I
 
06:18:51.110 --> 06:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
I've could it could it open things up to
 
06:18:55.868 --> 06:18:55.878 align:start position:0%
you know future Thing Future vaccines
 
06:18:59.990 --> 06:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
that um just I'm going to reiterate just
 
06:19:03.990 --> 06:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
like this allinclusive language in
 
06:19:05.948 --> 06:19:05.958 align:start position:0%
instead of if so if this was written for
 
06:19:08.750 --> 06:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
a specific reason then keep it specific
 
06:19:11.190 --> 06:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
but then kind of muddying it
 
06:19:14.350 --> 06:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
with these kind of words the biological
 
06:19:16.350 --> 06:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
products and everything else I'm here it
 
06:19:19.310 --> 06:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
just to me this when I read this bill
 
06:19:21.628 --> 06:19:21.638 align:start position:0%
and then I listen to you speak it's just
 
06:19:24.110 --> 06:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
not lining up for me so I don't know if
 
06:19:28.070 --> 06:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
you can why why not I I I only see the
 
06:19:31.110 --> 06:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
word RSV you know at the under
 
06:19:33.430 --> 06:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
methodology at the very end like I don't
 
06:19:35.590 --> 06:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
see it anywhere but I'm
 
06:19:38.910 --> 06:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
no thank you for your question um so as
 
06:19:42.510 --> 06:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
the the the the drug nurse fbab which is
 
06:19:44.390 --> 06:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
a monoclonal product does not fit into
 
06:19:46.510 --> 06:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
the definition of vaccine so instead of
 
06:19:48.390 --> 06:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
just limiting the bill by adding that
 
06:19:51.628 --> 06:19:51.638 align:start position:0%
one drug or that one monoclonal um you
 
06:19:53.590 --> 06:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
know the previous bill that this
 
06:19:55.830 --> 06:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee heard um would would basically
 
06:19:57.628 --> 06:19:57.638 align:start position:0%
you know for the pharmacist statute
 
06:19:58.750 --> 06:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
where you would have to come into the
 
06:20:01.510 --> 06:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
legislature to add every every single
 
06:20:03.628 --> 06:20:03.638 align:start position:0%
vaccination it was similar to to that to
 
06:20:06.510 --> 06:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
say um are this monoclonals are included
 
06:20:09.070 --> 06:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
under biolog um biological products
 
06:20:11.030 --> 06:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
there could be other vaccinations but
 
06:20:13.150 --> 06:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is targeted really for like as
 
06:20:14.948 --> 06:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
you said to solve this particular
 
06:20:17.948 --> 06:20:17.958 align:start position:0%
technical problem but in order to um we
 
06:20:19.390 --> 06:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
didn't think that it was great to put
 
06:20:21.190 --> 06:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
policy into place where it was only on
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
one thing whereas you would have you
 
06:20:24.990 --> 06:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
might have other um biologics that might
 
06:20:27.350 --> 06:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
be added and fit under that terminology
 
06:20:29.030 --> 06:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
the extent was not to be expansive what
 
06:20:31.830 --> 06:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:35.750 --> 06:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
inclusive Al set
 
06:20:37.830 --> 06:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
06:20:40.230 --> 06:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:20:42.990 --> 06:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I don't know
 
06:20:47.190 --> 06:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
much about AR Vis to correct me if I'm
 
06:20:50.708 --> 06:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
wrong but my understanding is uh the
 
06:20:55.510 --> 06:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
challenge with immunization from common
 
06:20:57.990 --> 06:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
cold is that those
 
06:21:02.590 --> 06:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
viruses mutate uh a lot so I wonder how
 
06:21:05.590 --> 06:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
often we will be facing new product with
 
06:21:05.600 --> 06:21:06.708 align:start position:0%
often we will be facing new product with
this

06:21:06.708 --> 06:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:21:12.150 --> 06:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
RSV uh antibodies uh uh and if that new
 
06:21:15.910 --> 06:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
product uh won't require any further
 
06:21:19.628 --> 06:21:19.638 align:start position:0%
authorization uh if if RSV virus mutates
 
06:21:21.468 --> 06:21:21.478 align:start position:0%
we will probably would need a different
 
06:21:23.110 --> 06:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:21:25.510 --> 06:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
antibodies uh to
 
06:21:27.750 --> 06:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
administer thank you for the question so
 
06:21:29.868 --> 06:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this uh
 
06:21:33.110 --> 06:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
monoclonal antibody um is the first sort
 
06:21:36.310 --> 06:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
if you will treatment for almost newborn
 
06:21:39.310 --> 06:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
shortly after newborn baby birth um that
 
06:21:41.868 --> 06:21:41.878 align:start position:0%
would prevent severe disease in infants
 
06:21:44.590 --> 06:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
so this is really just to give those
 
06:21:47.510 --> 06:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
little babies a chance not to get RSV in
 
06:21:49.628 --> 06:21:49.638 align:start position:0%
an RSV season under the age of eight
 
06:21:51.230 --> 06:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
months and Dr tansky can probably
 
06:21:52.430 --> 06:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong so I'm not a
 
06:21:55.948 --> 06:21:55.958 align:start position:0%
medical person um but the this is a
 
06:21:58.590 --> 06:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
groundbreaking drug for infants during
 
06:22:00.628 --> 06:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
RSV season there's been high rates of
 
06:22:04.150 --> 06:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
RSV and flu and also covid-19 and this
 
06:22:07.030 --> 06:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
drug would help those newborn babies in
 
06:22:09.150 --> 06:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
the who are born during RSB season to
 
06:22:12.110 --> 06:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
avoid severe illness um hospitalization
 
06:22:13.750 --> 06:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe long-term problems going
 
06:22:16.270 --> 06:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
forward with residual asthma or uh
 
06:22:18.750 --> 06:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
respiratory issues so I don't I can't
 
06:22:20.070 --> 06:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
speak to whether there would have to be
 
06:22:21.788 --> 06:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
a new variation of that but I believe
 
06:22:24.590 --> 06:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
that um the the thought is to have this
 
06:22:27.390 --> 06:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
drug to prevent severe illness during
 
06:22:29.708 --> 06:22:29.718 align:start position:0%
their the baby's first RSV season when
 
06:22:31.548 --> 06:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
babies get older and lungs get bigger it
 
06:22:33.150 --> 06:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be as much as a problem
 
06:22:34.990 --> 06:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
as it is during that first period but Dr
 
06:22:37.150 --> 06:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
tansy can come back up and and correct
 
06:22:39.628 --> 06:22:39.638 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong did you have a followup
 
06:22:42.548 --> 06:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
you all set okay any other
 
06:22:44.990 --> 06:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions see no other questions thank
 
06:22:45.750 --> 06:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
06:22:45.760 --> 06:22:46.990 align:start position:0%
you thank
[Music]

06:22:46.990 --> 06:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:22:49.150 --> 06:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant did you
 
06:23:12.830 --> 06:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:14.310 --> 06:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman also members of
 
06:23:15.868 --> 06:23:15.878 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
06:23:15.878 --> 06:23:16.670 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
Gary

06:23:16.670 --> 06:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
Gary
 
06:23:18.990 --> 06:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
Merchant representing Sullivan County
 
06:23:21.548 --> 06:23:21.558 align:start position:0%
district 6 clar M and Cen and it's been
 
06:23:23.150 --> 06:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
a long day so I'll try to make this
 
06:23:26.510 --> 06:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
short for the folks on the committee
 
06:23:28.510 --> 06:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
went back and looked at CDC currently in
 
06:23:31.310 --> 06:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
the vaccine program covid vaccine is not
 
06:23:33.390 --> 06:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
part of the program so we're not talking
 
06:23:34.948 --> 06:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
about Co
 
06:23:39.110 --> 06:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
number two when you look at the price
 
06:23:41.670 --> 06:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
differential it's a lot less expensive
 
06:23:44.230 --> 06:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
on the federal contract and is doing it
 
06:23:45.910 --> 06:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
commercially and private so it's going
 
06:23:47.510 --> 06:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
to save the state and everyone else a
 
06:23:50.590 --> 06:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of money three this is
 
06:23:52.030 --> 06:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
voluntary it's not
 
06:23:54.350 --> 06:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
mandatory um you can go into a
 
06:23:57.628 --> 06:23:57.638 align:start position:0%
physician's office today in the hospital
 
06:24:01.030 --> 06:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
and you can get access to it um you're
 
06:24:02.510 --> 06:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
not required to have it it's not a
 
06:24:03.948 --> 06:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
mandatory thing although you have a
 
06:24:06.510 --> 06:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
child in the hospital uh by the
 
06:24:08.350 --> 06:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
pediatrician if your child needs it
 
06:24:09.590 --> 06:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to get it cuz it's
 
06:24:11.430 --> 06:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
logical thing to do
 
06:24:14.548 --> 06:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
medically um I also would suggest to the
 
06:24:16.430 --> 06:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee I looked at the Washington
 
06:24:19.110 --> 06:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
statute this is something is a lot of
 
06:24:20.510 --> 06:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
states are wrestling with is how to
 
06:24:23.070 --> 06:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
include it in the state statute is Chang
 
06:24:26.150 --> 06:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
it from a vaccine or biological product
 
06:24:29.750 --> 06:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
to an immunization product to avoid the
 
06:24:31.310 --> 06:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
issue of biologics and so forth and
 
06:24:33.190 --> 06:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
narrow it down those are some
 
06:24:34.750 --> 06:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations I can have to the
 
06:24:36.270 --> 06:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
committee and also share to you I've
 
06:24:38.468 --> 06:24:38.478 align:start position:0%
worked at the medical center inventory
 
06:24:41.430 --> 06:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
Logistics that spoke to are real it's
 
06:24:42.868 --> 06:24:42.878 align:start position:0%
difficult when you have a provider going
 
06:24:44.310 --> 06:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
into the refrigerator trying to figure
 
06:24:47.110 --> 06:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
out which ones for the program which
 
06:24:49.670 --> 06:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
one's not for the program we tried to
 
06:24:51.948 --> 06:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
work through that at the medical center
 
06:24:54.910 --> 06:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
for probably several months we could
 
06:24:57.190 --> 06:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
never solve the problem and it became
 
06:24:58.628 --> 06:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
very very difficult because the
 
06:25:00.670 --> 06:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
providers doing the right thing by the
 
06:25:02.270 --> 06:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
patient would probably take the wrong
 
06:25:04.750 --> 06:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
product and we build it out which is
 
06:25:06.070 --> 06:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
what we shouldn't have done but we had
 
06:25:08.350 --> 06:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
to go back and reverse it the logistical
 
06:25:10.708 --> 06:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
problem of having two sets of inventory
 
06:25:13.070 --> 06:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
in the same location was very very
 
06:25:16.230 --> 06:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
problematic so for that I'll in my is
 
06:25:18.150 --> 06:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
that with my two minutes I didn't time
 
06:25:21.190 --> 06:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
you but I oh I trusted you to know the
 
06:25:23.670 --> 06:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
drill so thank you um are you taking
 
06:25:23.680 --> 06:25:24.750 align:start position:0%
drill so thank you um are you taking
questions

06:25:24.750 --> 06:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:25:28.390 --> 06:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
or representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
06:25:31.390 --> 06:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you uh representative um
 
06:25:33.548 --> 06:25:33.558 align:start position:0%
are there other states that use the term
 
06:25:36.190 --> 06:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
biological prods in statute does the
 
06:25:37.510 --> 06:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
federal government use the term
 
06:25:40.310 --> 06:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
biological pro products in any of their
 
06:25:43.670 --> 06:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
statutes and if so um how old is this
 
06:25:46.468 --> 06:25:46.478 align:start position:0%
term biological product well the term
 
06:25:47.868 --> 06:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
biological product's been around for a
 
06:25:50.270 --> 06:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
long time since the uh evolution of
 
06:25:51.910 --> 06:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
biological products going back probably
 
06:25:51.920 --> 06:25:53.150 align:start position:0%
biological products going back probably
several

06:25:53.150 --> 06:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
several
 
06:25:55.350 --> 06:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
years the question I think you're asking
 
06:25:58.430 --> 06:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
is regards the vaccines and the use of
 
06:26:00.590 --> 06:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
the word biological project products
 
06:26:03.150 --> 06:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
with vaccines and that's relatively
 
06:26:04.548 --> 06:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
recent and the reason why let's being
 
06:26:05.910 --> 06:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
changed I think a lot of our state
 
06:26:08.430 --> 06:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
statutes is to comply with what's going
 
06:26:10.548 --> 06:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
on with CDC and have access to the
 
06:26:12.948 --> 06:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
federal contracts because the contracts
 
06:26:15.468 --> 06:26:15.478 align:start position:0%
talk about vaccines per se but they're
 
06:26:17.270 --> 06:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
changing the vaccine themselves at the
 
06:26:18.948 --> 06:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
federal level but we also have to do
 
06:26:20.830 --> 06:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
something at the state level in order to
 
06:26:22.430 --> 06:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
be in compliance with the program so
 
06:26:24.270 --> 06:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
changing it from say vaccines and
 
06:26:26.230 --> 06:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
biological products maybe the word
 
06:26:29.390 --> 06:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
immunization or would probably be more
 
06:26:31.468 --> 06:26:31.478 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the committee I'm not sure
 
06:26:33.230 --> 06:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
but that's kind of where the history
 
06:26:35.910 --> 06:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
is representative
 
06:26:40.270 --> 06:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you um setting aside the
 
06:26:43.590 --> 06:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
actual terminology because it sounds to
 
06:26:46.948 --> 06:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
me like biologic is broader than just
 
06:26:48.910 --> 06:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
the RSV
 
06:26:52.590 --> 06:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
treatment um and immunological products
 
06:26:57.628 --> 06:26:57.638 align:start position:0%
are is broader still is not the purpose
 
06:26:59.830 --> 06:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
whether you agree with the purpose or
 
06:27:04.310 --> 06:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
not for using either biological product
 
06:27:07.468 --> 06:27:07.478 align:start position:0%
or immunological problem products so
 
06:27:10.948 --> 06:27:10.958 align:start position:0%
that the next vaccine the next
 
06:27:13.750 --> 06:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
immunization product that comes down the
 
06:27:17.350 --> 06:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
line which they do fairly
 
06:27:21.070 --> 06:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
quickly we don't have to come back again
 
06:27:24.110 --> 06:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
and again and again to modify the
 
06:27:28.310 --> 06:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
statute in order to have that once it is
 
06:27:32.430 --> 06:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
approved by the listed people and with
 
06:27:34.830 --> 06:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
the request of a
 
06:27:37.110 --> 06:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
we would be able to have that new
 
06:27:40.110 --> 06:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
treatment available quicker and not have
 
06:27:43.110 --> 06:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
to wait for the statute to change which
 
06:27:47.230 --> 06:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
often takes a whole year I concur with
 
06:27:49.190 --> 06:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
what you're saying grips and weer I was
 
06:27:50.830 --> 06:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
just talking about trying to Wordsmith
 
06:27:53.150 --> 06:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
it to use the word humanization products
 
06:27:55.750 --> 06:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
versus biological right no I understand
 
06:27:58.468 --> 06:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
that and I'm I'm not an expert in the
 
06:28:00.910 --> 06:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
words that pertain to these products so
 
06:28:02.788 --> 06:28:02.798 align:start position:0%
I was trying to take that out of the
 
06:28:07.590 --> 06:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
equation but I I wanted to be
 
06:28:11.270 --> 06:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
clear uh that the the the reason for
 
06:28:13.430 --> 06:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with the appropriate
 
06:28:17.628 --> 06:28:17.638 align:start position:0%
term whatever it is is to allow for
 
06:28:20.310 --> 06:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
changing science as as science goes
 
06:28:22.390 --> 06:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
forward and you may be comfortable with
 
06:28:26.750 --> 06:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
that or you may not but it would make
 
06:28:30.070 --> 06:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
more things accessible more quickly to
 
06:28:32.830 --> 06:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
the parents that want their children to
 
06:28:35.590 --> 06:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
have them I concur I think the goal here
 
06:28:37.708 --> 06:28:37.718 align:start position:0%
is to make it
 
06:28:40.110 --> 06:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
encompassing and what word we use to do
 
06:28:42.510 --> 06:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm open to the discussion I think
 
06:28:44.310 --> 06:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
your point is well made we have to be
 
06:28:46.590 --> 06:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
sure we don't box ourselves in to
 
06:28:48.390 --> 06:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
something without looking down the road
 
06:28:49.510 --> 06:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
and saying there could be something
 
06:28:50.868 --> 06:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
coming down the road that we don't don't
 
06:28:53.110 --> 06:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
want to have to go back legislatively to
 
06:28:55.230 --> 06:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
make it
 
06:28:57.150 --> 06:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
work other
 
06:28:59.868 --> 06:28:59.878 align:start position:0%
questions representative pazo thank you
 
06:29:01.910 --> 06:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
06:29:06.030 --> 06:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
question uh so um in this committee uh
 
06:29:06.040 --> 06:29:07.910 align:start position:0%
question uh so um in this committee uh
we

06:29:07.910 --> 06:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:29:12.270 --> 06:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
had a lot about vs database and some
 
06:29:15.150 --> 06:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
difficulties around it so do do you know
 
06:29:18.390 --> 06:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
anything about medwatch reporting uh how
 
06:29:22.670 --> 06:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's uh compared reporting to FDA where
 
06:29:26.590 --> 06:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
medat how it's compared to reporting to
 
06:29:29.150 --> 06:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
CDC where V
 
06:29:32.150 --> 06:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
database representative um I understand
 
06:29:34.548 --> 06:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
the words I have never used the Sy per
 
06:29:37.150 --> 06:29:37.160 align:start position:0%
se myself so I would not be able to
 
06:29:38.590 --> 06:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
address the question you have as far as
 
06:29:42.670 --> 06:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
medat versus the vaccine registry um or
 
06:29:44.548 --> 06:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
the vs if you will so I leave that
 
06:29:45.948 --> 06:29:45.958 align:start position:0%
somebody else has probably used the
 
06:29:48.190 --> 06:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
system to speak to that versus myself
 
06:29:51.270 --> 06:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
getting out of my knowledge
 
06:29:53.788 --> 06:29:53.798 align:start position:0%
base other
 
06:29:56.030 --> 06:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
questions he I'm seeing no other
 
06:29:58.230 --> 06:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
06:30:00.430 --> 06:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
