00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
being 10 o'clock we'll open our work
 
00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.070 align:start position:0%
being 10 o'clock we'll open our work
session

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll start by saying I think
 
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 align:start position:0%
we've gone through enough hoop jumping
 
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
on the adequacy formula uh because we're
 
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
all dreaming about it now
 
00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
we are uh so
 
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you
 
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh a document looks like this
 
00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
where Mickey took all the scenarios we
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
talked about played them up
 
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
all the different proposals
 
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
and basically what we're doing is we're
 
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
Reinventing the governor's budget
 
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
so it's my attitude to say
 
00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
let's go with the governor's budget
 
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
because that that's he's doing what we
 
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to do in the apportionment part
 
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
part on the right hand side
 
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh but you see
 
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
in the in the darkened column on the
 
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
front of this page
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's taking the
 
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
rates and rounding them up rounding them
 
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
off and I would take the the uh sped ell
 
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
and third grade reading and read to the
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
right proposal number six where it has
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
2100 800
 
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
and use those rounded numbers in the
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
column that says Governor's recommended
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
budget because I don't think the
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
governor is going to care if we round
 
00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 align:start position:0%
some of its numbers
 
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh and I talked with Mickey doesn't make
 
00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
all that much difference
 
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh the other item is the two percent
 
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.310 align:start position:0%
uh the other item is the two percent
cost

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh education adequacy education
 
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.650 align:start position:0%
uh education adequacy education
components

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
components
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
what we're going to add so one thing the
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
committee could consider is if you
 
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
recall the governor gets rid of the CPI
 
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
adjustment on the the cost of an
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
adequate education replaces it with an
 
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
annual two percent uh adjustment you
 
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
could also consider applying that to the
 
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
thresholds the equalized valuation
 
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
perforing reduced pupil thresholds is
 
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
part of the extraordinary needs Grant
 
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
otherwise those 1 million to six million
 
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
dollar range stays stagnant over time
 
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
but you could apply that so those are
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
adjusted to reflect inflation as well so
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
if we add that yep and that doesn't
 
00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 align:start position:0%
change really a whole lot for
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
for this biennium yeah so the between
 
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
what you were saying Mr chair rounding
 
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
up the sped to 2100 per pupil and
 
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
rounding up the English language
 
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
Learners to 800 per pupil and then
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
applying the two percent
 
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
also to the thresholds in the
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant other than
 
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
that you're suggesting keep staying
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
everything else with the governors
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's where I am I've dreamed about
 
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
this enough
 
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
any any comments yeah
 
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.730 align:start position:0%
any any comments yeah
um

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
I still find that the governor's budget
 
00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 align:start position:0%
provides um you know a larger boost for
 
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
everybody but there's still a great need
 
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the formula and I
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
like some of the proposals I think
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
proposal 60s fleshed out the most uh
 
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
where we take that larger amount that
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
he's giving some goes to all the schools
 
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
on the left side but then we also have
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
money to increase things on the the um
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
the right side of the formula so I
 
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
really like the idea of being able to
 
00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 align:start position:0%
Target Aid to students who really really
 
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
are going to be needing it
 
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.689 align:start position:0%
are going to be needing it
um

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 align:start position:0%
in the out years huh well I mean there's
 
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
still the difference between the
 
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended was 4 700 as base
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
and I would you know propose moving it
 
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
down to the 43 or the 4200 which Lee
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
which gives that
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
um five or four hundred
 
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
um per unit to be able to move to the
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
other side of the formula I just think
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
that it's a fair way of adjusting things
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
for schools that are in need well that's
 
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
what this does so if you want to take a
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 align:start position:0%
this does the adjustments to to you see
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess maybe I was
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding when you said I'm fine
 
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
with the concept of the governor's
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
budget but I would like to see money
 
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
move to the right hand side which either
 
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
looks like it could either be proposal
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
six or any of the other proposals six
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
and seven
 
00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
um seems to be in the range of what we
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
had talked about before
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
but if you go pick a town that you know
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
is is a
 
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
needy town so to speak for me and then
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make that much difference so
 
00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
so for proposal we'll pick on purpose
 
00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:37.259 align:start position:0%
was it proposal seven so we'll pick on
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
proposal seven so that does create an
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant of 122 million
 
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
dollars but there's still a 57 million
 
00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
dollar hold harmless required which is
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
why you see Farmington
 
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh and they there's loss of
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
stabilization even at the extraordinary
 
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
needs that high it still doesn't trigger
 
00:07:59.089 --> 00:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
more money to them than under current
 
00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419 align:start position:0%
law they would be a hold harmless
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
Community but this moves us away from
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
the stabilization model which has been
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
causing so much trouble and moving into
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
the whole harmless model which which has
 
00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
um I guess a longer shelf life a more
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable life instead of dealing with
 
00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
stabilization it gets us into another
 
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:21.539 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to the appropriateness of
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
it I can tell you under the governor's
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
proposal the hold harmless would phase
 
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
out in 10 years versus current law
 
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
all right so we had talked on Friday and
 
00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:38.099 align:start position:0%
I I thought we all had agreed that um we
 
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
would look at those communities that
 
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
don't fare well and I understand the
 
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
governor's budget is 10 years really to
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
have things play out the way they want
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
to see them play out I don't think we
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
have ever had a biennium where we have
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
not changed the formula somewhat somehow
 
00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.449 align:start position:0%
not changed the formula somewhat somehow
um

00:08:59.449 --> 00:08:59.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:02.180 align:start position:0%
I had hoped when I left here on Friday
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
that we would at least add
 
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
to 20 million dollars in each year of
 
00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:11.459 align:start position:0%
the biennium 40 million dollars total
 
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
to the left hand side I'm sorry to the
 
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
right hand side so that at least we
 
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
could begin to bring up a little bit
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
those tones that are getting hit the
 
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
hardest because right now it appears to
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
me that towns like Bedford and the more
 
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
wealthy towns are making out much better
 
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
than places like my city in Nashua uh
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
and some of those communities that have
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
really high f r numbers and and Mickey
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but is this a
 
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
scenario that with the what this chair
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
is proposing would still continue
 
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to put you on the spot
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
but this without the extra money on the
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
other side I just don't know how we can
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
make the poorer towns
 
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
um fare better
 
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:01.100 align:start position:0%
so as we heard with the governor's plan
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
the idea would be to eliminate the
 
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant replace it with a
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
hold harmless so essentially the whole
 
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
harmless brings the towns up to their
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
current law estimates so out of the new
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
the new money that's appropriated it's
 
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
not going to those property poor towns
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
that are dependent on their old
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
stabilization grant that is what the
 
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
chair had said this is part of the
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
10-year plan that the governor put
 
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
forward so you're not going to see that
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
in the 2425 biennium it'll start to kick
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
in and and if you look at I'm going to
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
see if I can find an example here
 
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
look at uh on page two of this handout
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
you see uh Belmont I'll pick on I'll use
 
00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:40.019 align:start position:0%
Belmont here you can see at a certain
 
00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:40.910 align:start position:0%
Belmont here you can see at a certain
point

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
Belmont starts to get new money under
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
the proposals
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't kick in for every town no
 
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:49.019 align:start position:0%
like Farmington for instance we just
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
looked over that it doesn't kick in this
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
does not line up perfectly with the
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
governor's 10-year Outlook but it's
 
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
essentially the same idea if you
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
replaced each of these proposals with a
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
biennium perhaps looking forward at some
 
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
point towns are going to start to see
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
increases from the governors some may be
 
00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
longer than others and it's just I don't
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
have those projections here to to tell
 
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:10.100 align:start position:0%
you when
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
but you know you can see Belmont they're
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
pretty close so the stabilization goes
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
away and they pick up some additional
 
00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:17.579 align:start position:0%
Aid and the other components that you're
 
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
increasing they start to see some some
 
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
more money Farmington it's it's a much
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
harder struggle Berlin Claremont
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
Franklin I think is an example if you
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
flip the Franklin you'll see they
 
00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:32.579 align:start position:0%
finally on the proposal nine they start
 
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
to see something so that tells me that
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
as part of the governor's plan it might
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
take a couple of budgets until you they
 
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
start to see an increase but it it would
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
be part of that long-term plan
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
so I what so
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think I'm hearing then that
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
by adopting the governor's proposal
 
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.670 align:start position:0%
by adopting the governor's proposal
that

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
the areas that we said we were committed
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
to on Friday
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
we will not be doing what we purported
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to do
 
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
um we'd be
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
projecting out many years into the
 
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.250 align:start position:0%
projecting out many years into the
future

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
and I have to say it's a very uncertain
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
future in terms of school funding we
 
00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:20.339 align:start position:0%
have a lawsuit coming down the road
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
um and so for the poor towns they are
 
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
not going to well
 
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
with their
 
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
their numbers
 
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
are different from what they have been
 
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
as because we're coming off the 2019 and
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm wrong in my projections
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
but will the city of Manchester the city
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
of Farmington will they be getting the
 
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
same amount as was projected in the last
 
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.730 align:start position:0%
same amount as was projected in the last
biennium

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
or are we going to be going with the
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
numbers as they stand now
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
um because it would seem that that would
 
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
draw a lesser amount of money
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
am I making myself clear
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
I think the whole harmless me says
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to get the same they got
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
for 20 for 24 and 25 under the
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal the towns that
 
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see an increase would be would
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
make sure they at least get what was
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
projected for them to get in fiscal 24
 
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
they'll also get that in fiscal 25 at a
 
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:29.339 align:start position:0%
minimum based on their new numbers
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
based on the Mark is shaking his head
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
based on what we estimated in November
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
right two well we estimated they were
 
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
getting 24. that is the minimum that
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
they get via the whole purpose thank you
 
00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
I just have two questions just to make
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
sure I'm completely
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
um understanding this so um I'm still on
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
page I guess I'm on page four now
 
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
um I was just looking at Fitzwilliam I
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we're all clear
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
and that I'm understanding this under
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget they
 
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
would receive 17 let's say thousand here
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm on Fitzwilliam I just
 
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
grabbed one example so that's
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
my guess my point is the
 
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.710 align:start position:0%
my guess my point is the
um

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:14.339 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at proposal three
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
four five six and so forth that's just
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
for this year this biennium this is not
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
spinning out across years
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
so you can't look at this and say oh and
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know on column whatever that there's
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
no change that just means there's no
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
change if we were to take this proposal
 
00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
this is not goes across time is that
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
right this is only 24 and 25. yeah so
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
that you know we don't want to look at
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
that and say and as if it were years
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
going out no these are separate from 24
 
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
25 and the numbers are the difference
 
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.310 align:start position:0%
25 and the numbers are the difference
between

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
um you know what's the 17 let's say 17
 
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
000 is
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
that much more that Fitzwilliam would
 
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
get under the recommended budget for
 
00:14:59.650 --> 00:14:59.660 align:start position:0%
this biennium is that what the 17 is
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
over the current law just so
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
it's not what they get it's above what
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
they're getting
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
that's just to be clear we're all
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
and there appear to be no decreases
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
um a lot of it seems most of the
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
communities basically stay the same
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
but then it's going to kick in later on
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
we still
 
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
um as hold harmless goes down what we
 
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
don't see here is how that affects some
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
of the other Communities going forward
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
which again gives me concerns
 
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
um for poor communities
 
00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:41.339 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that part of the
 
00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
10-year plan is the the right right hand
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
side of the formula is enriched
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
so I just
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing everything that's being said
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
and yes we spoke on Friday about moving
 
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
money from the left to the right and um
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
that's why we asked Nikki to prepare
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
these estimates right and now I'm
 
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
looking at them and I just you know got
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
here and I started looking at them uh
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
when I sat down
 
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the impact on Concord
 
00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Nashua under the
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal versus proposal
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
number nine so going all the way to the
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
other end
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
the changes in funding for those three
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
towns Concord would go from three to
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
nine million Manchester would go from 0
 
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
to 58.
 
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:41.579 align:start position:0%
million and Nasha would go from 7.5 to
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
21 pretty much we are talking about 76
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
million dollars in funding being taken
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
from pretty much everybody else and
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
concentrated into those three Towns now
 
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
I chose the extreme numbers right of the
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
range just to make a point of what the
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
range does of what moving money does
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
I am
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
obviously not gonna go anywhere near the
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
far end of that range because that level
 
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
of concentration in just three towns
 
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
kind of goes against the whole point of
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
helping everybody as much as possible
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
and you know I am open to maybe a you
 
00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:17.270 align:start position:0%
and you know I am open to maybe a you
know

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
smaller amount of money being moved from
 
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
the governor but if you just look at
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
those three towns the impact is
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
significant representative Murray was
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
pointing out proposal six there you'd be
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
looking at 37 additional million for
 
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.250 align:start position:0%
looking at 37 additional million for
Manchester

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know 10 for Nashua Ballpark and
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
you know uh Concord would get another
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
almost four
 
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's it's a huge amount of money and it
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
comes from every other town and my
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
concern is that we would be greatly
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
decreasing the number of towns that
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
benefit from it and just concentrate it
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
into a few
 
00:17:57.299 --> 00:17:59.210 align:start position:0%
into a few
so

00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
I mean she's trying to every town
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
benefits and this is all the same amount
 
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
of money that's being reproportioned but
 
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
every town benefits some will benefit
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
more but that's because some schools and
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
we're disadvantaged than others right
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
well poverty poverty in Nashua and
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester are pretty significant and I
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with those kind of
 
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.890 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with those kind of
increases

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
increases
 
00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:21.539 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's it's you know I know it's
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
significant but that's that's what
 
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do so and I I mean
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
Farmington stays the same but I I can
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
argue that look stabilization we've been
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
getting the same stabilization 2011 and
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
we've lost at least 300 kids I have no
 
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
problem but we're where we're at but
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
when we say everybody benefits I'm just
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
looking randomly because I was on the
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
Concord page I'm looking at Cornish
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
who's right there
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
they would no longer benefit if we go to
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
proposal four or higher and there are a
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
lot of other towns you know Deerfield
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
would not benefit anymore starting with
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
proposal seven all that money comes from
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
someone right it's a finite Port of
 
00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
money that we're looking to distribute
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
differently and
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's okay to move some but I
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
would caution against moving too much
 
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
because again a lot of the towns that
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise would benefit would no longer
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
benefit and I want to remind you that I
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
agree with the overall goals but if we
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
concentrate the age so much we are going
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
to lose the support for this
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know in the house because we are
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
taking a lot of the towns away from
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
benefiting from it and people like it or
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
not do look at their town I try not to
 
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
look at mine
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay but I would caution against going
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
too far down to the right side because a
 
00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:39.419 align:start position:0%
lot of the towns would suddenly go to no
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
new money under this and I'm happy to
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
well they're going to get new money not
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if I could just add a
 
00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
controversy you know a contradictory
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
perspective to what we just heard so
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
what we are looking at on this on this
 
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet shows us the next two year
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
biennium by altering that formula we've
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
all acknowledged that so
 
00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to remember
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
that we put our finger on the scale with
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
the higher number proposals to try to
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
benefit those property
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
um struggling uh districts so
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
we aren't seeing what happens in year
 
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
three four five six seven eight nine ten
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
but we all intellectually know by
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
putting our finger on the scale that
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
those property tones are going to start
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
to rise a little bit more in funding as
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
as as time comes through uh as we travel
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
down the timeline so
 
00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.299 align:start position:0%
when we decide to put our finger on that
 
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
scale by a lot or a little we know that
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
faster down that timeline those property
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
struggling districts are going to feel
 
00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
the benefits of of us trying to Target
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
the aid to them faster than we would to
 
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
the bedfords the hanovers the new
 
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.490 align:start position:0%
the bedfords the hanovers the new
castles

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
castles
 
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
um you know purposefully our
 
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
distribution scheme is going to help
 
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.230 align:start position:0%
distribution scheme is going to help
level

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
the district you know how much
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
everyone's getting over time so while we
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
can't see that here we intellectually
 
00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:21.299 align:start position:0%
understand that that is true that it
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
will happen over time
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
so my perspective is that when I'm
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
looking at you know the
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
the differences between a Handover and a
 
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
Berlin I my understanding is that
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
we may not take
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
a 1.9 million increase under the
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal but we would take a
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
300 000 increase under a different
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
proposal because I understand that that
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
Delta is going to go to another town
 
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.549 align:start position:0%
Delta is going to go to another town
faster

00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
faster
 
00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:54.539 align:start position:0%
to get those funds increasing faster
 
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:57.419 align:start position:0%
that they Hanover can do a little bit
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
better in in making our needs met under
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
that reduced
 
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.710 align:start position:0%
that reduced
um

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.750 align:start position:0%
um
proposal

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
but we know that the towns who are
 
00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:09.539 align:start position:0%
really struggling right now in our
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
current law and even under the
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed plan we'll see that
 
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
relief even faster and in greater number
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
over time and that is that is the
 
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
principle that I believed we all agreed
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
in in general we were talking about on
 
00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:27.419 align:start position:0%
Friday that we thought we were all
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
agreeing with so
 
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
um you know when we look at the snapshot
 
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
of of course Manchester or Nashua and
 
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:37.100 align:start position:0%
you know places like Concord under
 
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
proposal six or even proposal nine in
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
the the next biennium those numbers are
 
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
larger because we know they have larger
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
units of students the average daily
 
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.210 align:start position:0%
units of students the average daily
um

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
numbers of those students are higher but
 
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059 align:start position:0%
you know the general principle is the
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
same we we said that the reason why I
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
attire is because we wanted to Target
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
Aid where it was needed most so to say
 
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended proposal is
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
something that we are just gonna you
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
know default to because we run all these
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
other proposals and we're not seeing a
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
huge significant increase for the
 
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
property struggling districts that we
 
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
were just talking about on Friday I
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
think that's short-sighted because we've
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
we understand that by pushing down the
 
00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:27.059 align:start position:0%
proposal list to three four five six
 
00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:27.950 align:start position:0%
proposal list to three four five six
seven

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
we understand that we can't see it on
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
this spreadsheet but we understand even
 
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
closer in time those towns are going to
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
be doing better and
 
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.370 align:start position:0%
be doing better and
um

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
I just think I think it's
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have projections
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
to read for every town across the state
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
but you know we
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
I think the argument that we had on
 
00:23:48.659 --> 00:23:50.810 align:start position:0%
I think the argument that we had on
Friday

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
still stands today I think defaulting to
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
would be a missed opportunity
 
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.610 align:start position:0%
would be a missed opportunity
um

00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
and I hope I'm articulating it well but
 
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
I think the governor's representative
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say represented that what
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do was in his it was in the
 
00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:15.539 align:start position:0%
governor's budget yeah so we were
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
duplicating what they have already done
 
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
only we haven't seen it all we saw it
 
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
was when they made their uh budget
 
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
introduction we'll remember the the bar
 
00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.909 align:start position:0%
introduction we'll remember the the bar
charts

00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
charts
 
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
um bar graphs I'm sorry
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
having not seen what happens in year
 
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
three four five to ten I'm taking his
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
word for it
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
I think the only difference between the
 
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal the governor's
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
recommended and any of these other
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
additional scenarios three four five six
 
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine is that it's a steeper
 
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
precipitation to helping those New Year
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
towns faster so intellectually we're all
 
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
in the state we're all moving in the
 
00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
same direction it's just how faster do
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
you want that you know that change to
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
take place and you know as Mary has as
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative Heath has mentioned many
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
times in our work sessions you know we
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to change what
 
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
happens right now three years from now
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
we don't know what's going to happen but
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
what we can do to do this time is to
 
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
accelerate that change
 
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
under one of the other proposals than
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal to get to that
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal faster
 
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
but my unders
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
make you correct me if I'm wrong but my
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is we this reflects that
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
change and pick a town I mean it's it's
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:45.500 align:start position:0%
okay Tom you have a town I have a town
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at my own Tom Conway
 
00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:51.299 align:start position:0%
um under current law
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
gets 12 million under the governor's
 
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
recommended gets an additional 350
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
000 and then
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
that well I guess number three it it
 
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
gets a hundred thousand but then then it
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't get anything in these other
 
00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
proposals right so
 
00:26:17.169 --> 00:26:17.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't know what you'd go home and
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
say do you want explanation of what's
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
happening with Conway here like so yeah
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
I guess so so Conway Conway has a
 
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant
 
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
the amount of getting 4 700 per kid and
 
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
2500 per kid for free and reduced lunch
 
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
in the governor's proposal exceeds the
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
amount of the stabilization Grant
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
where are you getting those numbers well
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't I so there's
 
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
the paper behind all of these to just to
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
see that detail would be a ream for
 
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
everyone here so that's why you don't
 
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
have it I can't I can speak to what's
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
happening in an individual town I can't
 
00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
walk through what's happening individual
 
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
town so Conway has a small stabilization
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
Grant the governor's increase to base a
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
would exceed that so they would actually
 
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
see an increase in the governors
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
but as these proposals taper down the
 
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.810 align:start position:0%
but as these proposals taper down the
increase

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
the uh it doesn't offset the loss of
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
stabilization So eventually Conway would
 
00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
become a whole harmless town
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
so that's what's Happening Here you see
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
that cut off from proposal three to four
 
00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
thank you so just just to continue the
 
00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:26.810 align:start position:0%
thank you so just just to continue the
discussion

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
um I hear what representative haken
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
Phillips is saying and I agree
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
conceptually with that I mean that's
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
what we were discussing on Friday and I
 
00:27:36.649 --> 00:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
think we are all you know aligned in
 
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
terms of those goals but here's my
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
concern I I did run the
 
00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:45.059 align:start position:0%
percentage of uh the 120 120 something
 
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we're looking for
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
in this scenario
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
under the governance proposal the three
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
towns I mentioned would get about nine
 
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:55.820 align:start position:0%
percent of it under proposal
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
number nine they would get 63 percent of
 
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
it just those three times and that's
 
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
really what I have a problem with I
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
think we do need to send them more money
 
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.510 align:start position:0%
think we do need to send them more money
but

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
not to the point where the you know they
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
soak up more than half of this it's just
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
too much and I think it would unbalance
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
things one thing that wasn't brought up
 
00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
and frankly I'm bringing it up for the
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
record because I don't think it's
 
00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
something we can solve today
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
is that right now the governor 10-year
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
plan has significant increases in the
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs graft I mean he's
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
talking 50 percent of the biennium it's
 
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
aggressive increases there when we put
 
00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:36.419 align:start position:0%
more money there
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
obviously the governor won't be able to
 
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
maintain the 50 increases because it
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
could start from a large higher base and
 
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know explore the budget so there
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
will need we are essentially gonna Force
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
this plan to be adjusted down the road
 
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
too this is outside of the scope of our
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
discussion right now I think we should
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
focus on this biennium but it's
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
important to mention that that will also
 
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
be impacted all those 10-year plans and
 
00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:00.620 align:start position:0%
whatnot will have to be
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
significantly adjusted
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
I continue to be open to maybe you know
 
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
moving a little down from you know the
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
governor to the right but again probably
 
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
six or seven are a bit too far from me
 
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:16.460 align:start position:0%
just because of the
 
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
concentration of the eight to those
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
towns which do need the help but I think
 
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
we also have a lot of other towns that
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
need the help and I think we have to
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
find a
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable line where still a lot of
 
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
towns benefit but we do achieve the
 
00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
goals the policy goals that we were
 
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
talking about on Friday of maybe you
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
know spreading this more based on need
 
00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
than just based on the number of
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
students I I just it's just a question
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
of you know where we are gonna end up
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
and what criteria do we use one thing
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
that I would appreciate Mickey just
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
ability of this community to kind of
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
hopefully predict what the house may
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
vote on when they look at this stuff is
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
there any chance to add a bottom line
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
you know count how many towns benefit
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
under each of those proposals and throw
 
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
it in at the bottom of the spreadsheet
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
or maybe just have it there and you know
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
read it to us maybe after the lunch
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
break or
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know because when we cut that number
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
of towns we may lose support in the
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
house and I don't want to end up with a
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
budget that would you know be not
 
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
supported in the house because of the
 
00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
tinkering with a formula I can I can do
 
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
that uh I can have that for you just
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
account you know if we reconvene after
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
if I can add you know if you're looking
 
00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
at the percentage of towns that budget
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
this you also need to look at the
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
percentage where the percentage of poor
 
00:30:45.289 --> 00:30:45.299 align:start position:0%
students in these towns and where those
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
are and that's kind of an important part
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
that you're missing and um so you know
 
00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting data point but
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a very
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
informative one if you're not looking at
 
00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
where the poor students actually reside
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you that we
 
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
um you know considering the extremes is
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
interesting to give a whole perspective
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
but I think if we could focus on perhaps
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
selecting one of these things from the
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
middle that would achieve within the
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
governor's budget the idea of everybody
 
00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
getting something but also saying we
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there are schools that
 
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
need have more need and so I'm glad to
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
hear you say you would consider one of
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
the proposals in the middle and I think
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
we might focus our attention on one of
 
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.690 align:start position:0%
we might focus our attention on one of
those

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
just can I just clarify that at this
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
point in time we have dismissed the
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
concept of adding any additional funds
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
I that's another variable I don't know
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
if anybody dismissed it but we still
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
don't exactly know what the bottom line
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
is I was asking the chair please we're
 
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:48.620 align:start position:0%
talking about the 20 million each year
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.059 align:start position:0%
no I mean if we don't we're still that's
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
on the table are you still on the table
 
00:31:58.679 --> 00:32:01.730 align:start position:0%
on the table are you still on the table
yeah

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
where would that uh make where would
 
00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:06.299 align:start position:0%
that land
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
if you had 20 million to distribute on
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
the right hand side within the context
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
of the governor's formula so only
 
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs is our targeted
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
Grant it would bring it up to 52.50
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
so the amount of the
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
so close somewhere between proposals
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
four and five as far as targeted Aid
 
00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:27.529 align:start position:0%
four and five as far as targeted Aid
goes

00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:32:27.539 --> 00:32:28.250 align:start position:0%
goes
um

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
and I I've got I've got that I can give
 
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
you a town by town on that just so you
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
you can see what that looks like as well
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
it's probably gonna like I said it'll
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
it'll be a kind of a blend between the
 
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
towns that benefit from getting 4 700
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
will get that benefit and then some of
 
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
those poorer towns will get a little bit
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
more money too but like I said it will
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
only be it'll be somewhere around the
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
four or five proposal range but I can
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
get that for you and that and that goes
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
in the extraordinary what's it called
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
well so extraordinary needs Grant that's
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
the only targeted Aid component that's
 
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
part of the governor's plan so now do
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
the ancestors and the Concords and the
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
nashuas get extraordinary needs uh yes
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
because that's to to
 
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
this I mean I I that means that they're
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:21.980 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm just saying comparatively
 
00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if it's spitting in the
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
ocean or not I can print it you got a
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
big you're spending a billion 20 million
 
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
stuff wow
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
would be 40 million over the biennium
 
00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:43.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.009 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:33:45.009 --> 00:33:45.019 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead so I would say you know to add
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
in that 20 million I'm certainly or 40
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
over the biennium I'd be supportive of
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
that I would still and that would move
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
me more towards proposal three or
 
00:33:58.009 --> 00:33:58.019 align:start position:0%
proposal four because I still think that
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
when you're in you know perhaps money
 
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:01.669 align:start position:0%
when you're in you know perhaps money
um

00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
where did it go increasing something
 
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
um I think representative lad had one of
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
them had mentioned the extraordinary or
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
special ed which is on the left side but
 
00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:13.379 align:start position:0%
you that may be getting too much uh
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
we're just probably going down a rabbit
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
hole there but um I do think it's
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate to lower the base a little
 
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
bit and if we added that 20 or 40
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
million to the other side I could you
 
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
know I'd be happy with proposal three or
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
four right now I'm still looking at five
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
six seven is maybe going a little too
 
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.430 align:start position:0%
six seven is maybe going a little too
far

00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
far
 
00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair
 
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419 align:start position:0%
I I'm really uncomfortable right now
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
talking about spending down the
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
education trust fund because I do
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
believe that we're heading into a
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
significant recession that maybe even
 
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
worse than what the ways and means is
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
predicting and I I'm not gonna say that
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
I'm deciding on it but I'm very very
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable right now at that thought
 
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.609 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable right now at that thought
because

00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
it is we are already looking to increase
 
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
the funding for Education significantly
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
which is a good thing and it's a good
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
policy but going too far puts out that
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
puts out puts out this puts us at risk
 
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
of not being able to sustain these
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
levels in future bienniums and
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's not good to jump up only to come
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
down and zigzag all over the place so I
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
would rather have a measured increase
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
that we know we can sustain and protect
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's important to give you know
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
stability to this and not jerk funding
 
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
around all the time so I I would urge us
 
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
to be a bit cautious because
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
right thank you for Sharon
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
um yeah we I I wouldn't be too concerned
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
about taking down the uh education trust
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
fund because if it runs short money it
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
can go to the general fund and that's
 
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
that's the way it was designed the
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
money's sitting there not doing anything
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't help anybody
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
and if I can put my foot in the bear
 
00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.250 align:start position:0%
and if I can put my foot in the bear
trap

00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
trap
 
00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.370 align:start position:0%
trap
um

00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.970 align:start position:0%
um
[Laughter]

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
you know they're I can just do with one
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
leg uh there's also you know the
 
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
possibility we have the 60 million in
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
the EFA and let me just you know put out
 
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:14.099 align:start position:0%
my my little chart here in my mind we
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
have actual students Flesh and Blood
 
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
students who are special needs who
 
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
really need help in the school now
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
they're there they exist their needs are
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
identified with the EFA I don't have any
 
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
problem with some appropriate increase
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
in that but um right now those are
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
hypothetical students they don't exist
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
we don't know where they're going to be
 
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
the commissioner does not have a finance
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
what's it called a finance fiscal note
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
on that he doesn't know um Caitlyn has
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
been doing her best and she doesn't have
 
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
any information so we have just a data
 
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
point floating out in space without any
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
data to support it so if weren't
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
comfortable with taking as
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative papovichi Mueller
 
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
suggests going down in the um the
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
balance we have 60 million dollars we
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
could take the 20 million from there to
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
put it over and that would still leave I
 
00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
mean that I would take 30 million I'd
 
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
actually take more but I won't
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
um you know we have money set aside for
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
students who don't exist and we have
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
students who do exist that have actual
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
needs and so we could reduce the EFA
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
portion of it and move that towards the
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
students who have actual needs so that's
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
another possibility of where there is
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
money in there if we don't want to mess
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
with the balance my understanding of EFA
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
funding it's in the in the adequacy
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
confront of this formula
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
they get they get the base
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
that if it's forty seven hundred dollars
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
that's what the EFA funds are so what
 
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
we're already accounting it's not like
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's a separate budget it's in this
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
budget can you address that Mickey
 
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
so this this includes just Public
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
District Schools so they get the same
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
rate in an EFA but that's a different
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
appropriation above and beyond the
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
billion that you see here there's
 
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
another line item in the budget for you
 
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
it leaves the public school and draws
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
down the EFA it takes that it takes the
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
public school piece with it correct so
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
so if if a student is in this count say
 
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal 24 account and does take
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
up an EFA the following year there is a
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
one-year lag with the count but then so
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
the EFA would be paid in the year that
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
the child is in their news and school
 
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
situation the district would get a
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
payment because they were in the last
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
year's count but then that following
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
year that child would no longer be in
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
this formula right correct so I'm half
 
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.270 align:start position:0%
this formula right correct so I'm half
right

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.890 align:start position:0%
right
so

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
talking about bear traps
 
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
look I'm not gonna support
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
reducing the EFA funding it's it's a
 
00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
good program and if any student in DFA
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
funding is found to not exist I'm sure
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
there will be a fraud case against the
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
people who try to file for a child that
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist but
 
00:38:58.849 --> 00:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
I am so not talking about fraud you
 
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
cannot go down that I'm just saying that
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
these students have not been identified
 
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
yet but I am no way suggesting that
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
there's fraud so please don't do it I
 
00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate it no I was just confused by
 
00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
that do not exist statement but I
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the clarification because
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that they may not be personally
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
identified doesn't mean they don't exist
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
so as long as we are agreed on that it's
 
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
a good thing that all those are kids who
 
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
live in the state and have you know
 
00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to an advocated
 
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
equation so I'm not willing to reduce
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
that and you know I'm sure that we can
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
figure out how to DVD a large amount of
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
money where's
 
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
you know trying to
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate here for Education uh to
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
so how comfortable is everybody with the
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
so I mean it looks like
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
and what can we do to uh
 
00:39:59.089 --> 00:39:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
yeah well what so what are you supposed
 
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:02.060 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
something I I would be open to looking
 
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
at one of the proposals maybe three four
 
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.790 align:start position:0%
at one of the proposals maybe three four
five

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
oh sorry what are we doing well yeah
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's correct but the ad in the 20 I
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
believe um Mickey said between three and
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
four if you add to 20 is that correct
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
so disregard that comment I think that
 
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
was a little too complex to what I was
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
trying to explain there I think if
 
00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:28.619 align:start position:0%
you're gonna add 20 million you have to
 
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
decide where you want you to add 20
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
million from so is your base the
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget and then
 
00:40:35.329 --> 00:40:35.339 align:start position:0%
if so do you want the 20 million just to
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
go into extraordinary needs and that's
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
what it sounds like the plan of the
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
motion yes
 
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
so and I and I can present a town by
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
town later this afternoon on that if you
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
want to see what that looks like
 
00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:49.690 align:start position:0%
want to see what that looks like
um

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:49.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
before the motion I would like to see
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
those numbers I mean I cannot vote the
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
only vote I can give you right now is a
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
no if you're asking me to vote without
 
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
even looking at the numbers okay I mean
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
the analysis would have to be there and
 
00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying I will support it after I
 
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
see the numbers but I can tell you that
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
for sure I cannot support it without
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
even looking at that
 
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.970 align:start position:0%
even looking at that
and

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:09.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
assuming that that is not gonna happen
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the you know looking at where we are
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
right now I am open to again you know
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
the three or four or five
 
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
from this line but then it starts to get
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
too concentrated and you don't we don't
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
want to go to an extreme that's what I'm
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
trying to argue here not that we don't
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
want to help I they absolutely need the
 
00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.450 align:start position:0%
want to help I they absolutely need the
help

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
but if we move if we swing the pendulum
 
00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:38.099 align:start position:0%
too far to the right we are really
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
concentrating this beyond the level that
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
I would be capable of supporting and you
 
00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.990 align:start position:0%
I would be capable of supporting and you
know

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
I am yes so Mr chair it sounds like
 
00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:51.530 align:start position:0%
I am yes so Mr chair it sounds like
um

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
there are folks who are willing to
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
entertain a four or five um but we want
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
to see the numbers by adding the
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
additional so could we
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
um cease this discussion right now and
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
go on to the other areas because that
 
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
will help us make decisions that we have
 
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
to make because we're going to be
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
looking at what are the other things
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
where from the education trust we're
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
going to be spending money on
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
and then come back this afternoon after
 
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
Mickey runs the numbers so everybody
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
will have a chance to see what the
 
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
numbers look like with those additional
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
I might suggest that you know we're
 
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
focusing in on you know proposal four or
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
five that we pick a proposal and then we
 
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
could ask Mickey to say what will this
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
look like if we add 20 million so when
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
he comes back after lunch but I think we
 
00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:41.099 align:start position:0%
could possibly pick on a proposal now
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
get that done
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
um we'll all be you know we'll be
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the middle and
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
um then we can say what will 20 million
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
additional for special or you know
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
whatever it is on the other side look
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
like but then we can at least move
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
forward on this I think there's Goodwill
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
towards picking one of these proposals
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
I'm but I'm I'm for sticking with the
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
governor's number
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
the 4700. can I ask a question yes
 
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:12.910 align:start position:0%
the 4700. can I ask a question yes
please

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
we're live streaming so he's
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
he is
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:23.900 align:start position:0%
operated very soon thank you very much
 
00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:26.660 align:start position:0%
you got to turn to Michael
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
it's Monday
 
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
um the governor's proposal has a point
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
which I like and that's where the within
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
the differentiated Aid special education
 
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:41.339 align:start position:0%
is increased that will help the poor
 
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
Community because there is a definite
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
relationship between economics and a
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
community and achievement and um and and
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
f r Medicaid
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's a positive note
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
um but as we have said before at forty
 
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
seven hundred dollars
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
um unless you're going to present some
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a spreadsheet which shows the
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
how this extends out over these this
 
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
10-year period
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
look at all the towns in the North
 
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.170 align:start position:0%
look at all the towns in the North
country

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
they're all taking a shaft
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
and they're not getting the support in
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
terms of poverty like a town which I
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
have just south of me where their their
 
00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
tax rates going up 22 percent because
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
the specialized students moved in but
 
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
not just that it's just the cost of
 
00:44:29.329 --> 00:44:29.339 align:start position:0%
doing business is Way Beyond and
 
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
everybody's elevating up above thirty
 
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
we can't sustain that and so where the
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
money has to come from is either from
 
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
that education trust fund of leveling
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
some more into it putting more there or
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
from that base adequacy figure I look at
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
all the towns which are and initially
 
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
showing and folks on the floor are going
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
to look at that
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
and they're going to see wow Hanover 1.9
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars Haverhill zero
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a huge difference
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
there and and so somehow I like I like
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the fnr within the governor's budget
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
but I also like uh four or five
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh and with some support given to the
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
areas that we really need to support and
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
that's through the extraordinary needs
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
Grant which is really that's the area if
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
you want to help these poorer towns
 
00:45:21.359 --> 00:45:22.069 align:start position:0%
you want to help these poorer towns
um

00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
with their economic issues that's where
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
we have to do something with that and I
 
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
know that's going to cost more I know it
 
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.190 align:start position:0%
know that's going to cost more I know it
but

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:31.849 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're in a process right now of dealing
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
with uh various uh suits
 
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
in in the court system to that you know
 
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
with conval and valinsky issue that has
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
to be resolved and I know the governor
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
is trying through this to show it on the
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
left-hand side
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
but initially that money is not helping
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
where we need to help
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to get caught up with
 
00:45:59.329 --> 00:45:59.339 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I made my communicating my
 
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
buoyant here that uh forty seven hundred
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
dollars even though it's wonderful you
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
know if you look at the inputs and base
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
costs right now
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're supporting K through 2 education
 
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
at a PTR pupil teacher ratio of 1 to 25.
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
grades 3 through 12 and a pupil teacher
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
ratio of 1 to 30.
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
you know that's not happening there's no
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
classrooms out there where 30 kids in
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
them in grade three
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
and so that difference is being made up
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
on the local level that's part of the
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
reason why you're seeing these property
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
taxes Skyrocket because we're we're
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
trying to take an old formula and crunch
 
00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
it around a little bit to try to make it
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
work the governor's on track to doing
 
00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:47.339 align:start position:0%
something here but it needs more work
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
from this group right here thank you
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
if I may thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:56.339 align:start position:0%
under a
 
00:46:58.849 --> 00:46:58.859 align:start position:0%
assume no new money coming in right now
 
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
forget about the you know trust the
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
education trust fund or anything just
 
00:47:05.809 --> 00:47:05.819 align:start position:0%
with this bottom line
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
am I hearing you correctly that you
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we take some money
 
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
from the 4700 base adequacy and move it
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
into spread move it to the right hand
 
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
side or I thought you were talking about
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
special education the governor's budget
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
already has an additional rate Beyond
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
where we are but you know yes I I
 
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe we need to put more
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
money there as well but wouldn't putting
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
it into the special education also keep
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
it on the left side but Target a bit
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
better to the towns that because if if
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
there is one thing that's amazingly
 
00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
expensive is a special education student
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
right I mean they tend to take a
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
disproportion a large amount of
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
resources because they have you know
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
specific specific needs that we need to
 
00:47:46.619 --> 00:47:47.569 align:start position:0%
specific specific needs that we need to
address

00:47:47.569 --> 00:47:47.579 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
so is that what you're suggesting
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
because that's what I thought I heard
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I I probably wouldn't take special
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
education through other means too and we
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
haven't even addressed that special
 
00:47:59.329 --> 00:47:59.339 align:start position:0%
education Aid catastrophic Aid there's a
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
formula which if you talk about broken
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
formulas there's the broken formula when
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
you have to put seventy thousand dollars
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
up first before you even start getting
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
state aid on this mandated program which
 
00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
locals don't have any control over at
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
all and the way that schools are making
 
00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
it right now
 
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
to a degree is a result of the 650
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars that came down through
 
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
the stabilization and the Esser monies
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
and and all the cares act all that and
 
00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
they have Paris that they're paying now
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
however they're running out in 2024
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's basically going to go off the
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
cliff and you're we're going to see
 
00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
where we're going to be really hit hard
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
so uh I I suggest that we try to look at
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
that top figure the governor has the
 
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
forty seven hundred dollars move part of
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
that and I think that's what we've
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
communicated in the past and also be
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
looking at education trust fund to help
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
do what we're talking about over here
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
something has to be done
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
um I agree with you but frankly that
 
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
just makes it I agree with you but I
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
think that makes it important to
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
preserve Those portions of the education
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund and funding because we
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
realize there will be
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
additional expenses we'll have to make
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the future to address the special
 
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.010 align:start position:0%
in the future to address the special
education

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
I I agreement a degree on that but you
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
look at what's going on today you can't
 
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
a dollar can't buy a loaf of bread
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
anymore and you leave it in that trust
 
00:49:23.809 --> 00:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
and what's it going to be doing for you
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
there just sitting there as parmie
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
it loses money because of inflation that
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
that Joe that's where I am right exactly
 
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know that got us down the
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
road Mick do you know what we're gonna
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's so I think for me it's the
 
00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
difference between the 4700 and I I'm
 
00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
hearing 4 500
 
00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
proposal four four yeah is that four or
 
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
five which one is anybody
 
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
I would say for
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
and then take the take that difference
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
and put it in on the right hand side
 
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:18.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if I had a vote today I'd go
 
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
with proposal nine so so if if I can go
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
to to five I would feel much more
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable I'm looking at the
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
difference between the governor's
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
recommended the numbers all the way down
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
the sheet and proposal five it gets me
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
closer to the goal that I'm
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'm working towards I think you know if
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
you look at Hanover my my district my
 
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
home District you know 1.9 million
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
increased because of Base Aid would go
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
down under proposal 5 to 1.29 million
 
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
it's still a lot of money to hand over
 
00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:53.339 align:start position:0%
that we don't currently need and I know
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
that we could be targeting it better so
 
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
you know the difference between 1.5 and
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
1.2 is
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
not huge in my district and I I you know
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
if I can send that money to districts
 
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
that really could use the extra three
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year in the
 
00:51:08.809 --> 00:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
first biennium then that's that's
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
exactly what I should be voting for so
 
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
proposal five is if I am forced to
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
choose between the governor's proposal
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
four and five I'm choosing five I um I
 
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
would suggest that both four and five be
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
prepared please because I'm not sure if
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
I can go all the way to five
 
00:51:27.049 --> 00:51:27.059 align:start position:0%
and when you say prepared plus 20
 
00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
million a year yes so I can run that
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
analysis I can run the governor's
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
recommended with plus 20 million and
 
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
then I can run four and five if you'd
 
00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:38.099 align:start position:0%
like plus 20 million and just to make it
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
clear that 20 million will all be
 
00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.650 align:start position:0%
clear that 20 million will all be
targeted

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:41.660 align:start position:0%
targeted
 
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
yes and then just one thing to think
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
about as we just to prepare for this
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
afternoon the governor's budget changes
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant by
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
increases it by 50 every biennium it's
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
starting at 650 dollars
 
00:51:59.569 --> 00:51:59.579 align:start position:0%
proposal four or five or even the
 
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
governor's plus 20 any of these plus 20
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
million the the extraordinary needs
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
Grant is going to be multiple thousand
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
dollars so you just want to what's your
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
policy not sure you're going to want to
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
increase that by 50 per year that's
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
going to get pretty pretty large in
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
those out years so that's something just
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
we might have to modify that provision
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
of hb2 if you do increase the
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant so just
 
00:52:22.609 --> 00:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
nothing you have to decide right now but
 
00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059 align:start position:0%
something to think about if we're gonna
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
do a Ed funding plan Beyond two years so
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying that if the governor's
 
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
budget increasing 50 percent each year
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
that's it that's huge so in so under
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's 650 per equalized valuation per
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch people for
 
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
Extraordinary needs 50 per year or
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
biennium in the governors goes out to
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal uh 2034 by any of it only
 
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
gets up to I say only but it gets up to
 
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
just under five thousand dollars
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
but if what we're talking about here is
 
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
targeting an extra 20 million
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
extraordinary extraordinary needs you
 
00:52:59.450 --> 00:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
may be doing four thousand dollars per
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
pupil this year so that plus 50 for each
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the next two by any is gonna
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
explained and I think that was the
 
00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:08.270 align:start position:0%
explained and I think that was the
intention

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
intention
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
I think I would just just think about
 
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
that between now and this afternoon and
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
we can talk more about that later if I
 
00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:22.940 align:start position:0%
may suggest could we ask Miki to
 
00:53:26.329 --> 00:53:26.339 align:start position:0%
calculate the percentage increase which
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
over 10 years would result in a similar
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
final increases with the governors it's
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
just you know a new exponential that
 
00:53:36.049 --> 00:53:36.059 align:start position:0%
would it would slow the great to get to
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
the similar point because I'm concerned
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
seriously about blowing up the state
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
budget in 10 years if the law would be
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
you know as is I I love doing that type
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
of analysis I really do we're down to
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
hours to when we can never mind I would
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
love to provide that but there would
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
have been weeks ago we would have had to
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
have started that I think
 
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
put this increase to this biennium so
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
that we're owning it only for this
 
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.309 align:start position:0%
that we're owning it only for this
biennium

00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
I if I had to make a bet
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
um we this formula will never get out to
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
um just because of all the variables
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
that are occurring outside it so I think
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
we should just concentrate on this
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
biennium and and our actions can be um
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
in hp2 that says that
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
well that's that's all we're affecting
 
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
right right right that's the facts but
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
that that but
 
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
going out 10 years I don't think would
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
serve us well right now I think it isn't
 
00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
it wasn't Mickey saying that the
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
governor's budget spends it out over
 
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
um 10 years or so so and I think you
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
know we can't predict the future you
 
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
don't want to legislate for the future
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
this is a significant I think a very
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
good change I think this is a positive
 
00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
change so I think in two years seeing
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
where the schools are and where we are
 
00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
then that becomes a new starting point
 
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
to see how we adjust that so I think
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
this is enough of a change that I don't
 
00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
think it would be useful to try to spin
 
00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:10.140 align:start position:0%
out what this would look like to try to
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
match it exactly to the governor's
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
proposal but to say instead of having
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
his do it over the 10 years let's get
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
this in for this two years and not start
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
trying to predict the future
 
00:55:21.849 --> 00:55:21.859 align:start position:0%
agreed okay
 
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
moving on so in and I'll put that
 
00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:27.059 align:start position:0%
together for after just one thing to
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
keep in mind
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
even though the intentions not to change
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
it every two years or the next 10 years
 
00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
you do have to set a law of what it will
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
be in fiscal 26. so the law has to say
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
what the formula would be in 26 you
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
can't just say for these two years only
 
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
do this and no Ed funding in 26.
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
oh man if there's preliminary estimates
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
that the maybe Mark's going to talk
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
about that but they have to publish
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
preliminary estimates for fiscal 26
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
before you have a 25 legislative session
 
00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:56.579 align:start position:0%
so they would need some sort whatever
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
you have on the books for law is what
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
they would publish as 26. yeah Mickey's
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
explaining it and Mark manganel Bureau
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
School finance department of education
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
um what Mickey's explaining is true
 
00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
whatever you put into law is legally
 
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
binding so
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
um we take that number as a we don't say
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
we don't say that your intent that you
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
want to change it at some later date we
 
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
just say the law is the law so we would
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
make estimates that that acceleration
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
Factor would be what it is the one uh a
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
50 increase and then we would send
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
estimates and then school districts
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
would build their budgets off their
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
estimates and then at a later date you
 
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
made a a decrease in that because you
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
said we can't afford this they would be
 
00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
building their budgets off a higher
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue so although you really you're
 
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
focusing on 24 25 and it's way too late
 
00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
to do these complex uh product
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
projections out
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
um you do have to consider
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
um whatever you pass this law you do
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
have to treat it as if it is locked
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
because that is how the Department's in
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
so I think we're good with that for now
 
00:56:58.609 --> 00:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
I'll do some work while a few folks are
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
busy across the hall this afternoon and
 
00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
if we meet after that I'll have some
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
more more stuff for us
 
00:57:04.859 --> 00:57:06.170 align:start position:0%
more more stuff for us
yeah

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:12.650 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
so we can
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
we can agree that 125
 
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
will go to full Finance with no
 
00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:38.210 align:start position:0%
will go to full Finance with no
recommendation

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
no the wetlands no
 
00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
oh I'm just I just happened my eyes just
 
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
fell on that one so do you do you want
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
to start at the top Mr chair do you want
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
to jump to we can go wherever you want
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
to go let's start at the top sorry
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
if I could briefly before we go to the
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
new topics the analysis I was asking
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
Mickey for
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
um it will just take 30 seconds right
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
now we are starting from 6 50 and we are
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
going to 49 36 by 50 increases if we
 
00:58:17.809 --> 00:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
would start for example at 1100 because
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
of all the money we are looking to move
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
to the right side in the same amount of
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
time instead of 49 36 will be going to
 
00:58:24.119 --> 00:58:25.849 align:start position:0%
time instead of 49 36 will be going to
83.53

00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
83.53
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
and in order to achieve the same 4936 in
 
00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
the same amount of time instead of 50
 
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
percent we'd have to change hb2 to
 
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
increase by about 35 percent
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
I would just want to State for the
 
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
record and then we can go to our you
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
know plan discussion that I don't think
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
I would be comfortable increasing the
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
right hand side without also adjusting
 
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
the percentage of increase to make sure
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
that we don't end up with huge increases
 
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
that's that's all I just wanted to share
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
that really quickly and we can return
 
00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.809 align:start position:0%
that really quickly and we can return
too

00:58:56.809 --> 00:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
well so that we don't start from a much
 
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
higher base and then exponentially
 
00:59:03.849 --> 00:59:03.859 align:start position:0%
increase because those increases will be
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
spectacularly expensive and we cannot
 
00:59:08.809 --> 00:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
write law counting on the fact that
 
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
somebody is going to fix this huge
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
amount of promises we make that we could
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
have we could never write those checks
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to sign a check I cannot
 
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.589 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to sign a check I cannot
write

00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.599 --> 00:59:22.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:24.660 align:start position:0%
where we are is so you do have a new
 
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
tracking sheet package today with
 
00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:27.710 align:start position:0%
tracking sheet package today with
amendments

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
um and I did update that and I'll point
 
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
us to a couple of changes that I made
 
00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.109 align:start position:0%
us to a couple of changes that I made
um

00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:35.569 --> 00:59:35.579 align:start position:0%
later on in this document so I don't
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
know if we're ready to take a vote on
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
the section six and seven relative to
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
the retirement system uh retirement
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
system for ccs and H employees after
 
00:59:47.329 --> 00:59:47.339 align:start position:0%
January 1 2024.
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:03.650 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
uh my it's just a matter of principle
 
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
that this would re uh have an impact on
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
the SEIU and all members for the
 
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
community caller system after 24 would
 
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
not be part of the retirement system
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
which could have an impact on the
 
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
overall Retirement System
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I can just Echo I don't want to
 
01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
take I feel badly I don't want to take
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
Choice away from anyone but I because
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's a significant fiscal impact I do
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
not understand I don't know what that
 
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
impact would be on the retirement system
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
which is already struggling on its own
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
so I just am not comfortable with that
 
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:57.289 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:00:57.289 --> 01:00:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:00.410 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:02.339 align:start position:0%
um Sally fellow state representative for
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
Grafton 8 which is Plymouth Ashland in
 
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.109 align:start position:0%
Grafton 8 which is Plymouth Ashland in
holdiness

01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
holdiness
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
um also a member of the retirement
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
system I would just say for the
 
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
Community College people I think that
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
that that's should be up to them to
 
01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:18.299 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not if they want to if
 
01:01:19.849 --> 01:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
they think it's a good idea to pull out
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
of the retirement system for the ones in
 
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
the future that they should make that
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
own decision and also to say that every
 
01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.829 align:start position:0%
own decision and also to say that every
employee

01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
um who whether they're in the any
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
employee anywhere always has the option
 
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
to do their own retirement planning with
 
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
the IRA or also
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
um if they work for the state you can do
 
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:51.890 align:start position:0%
 
onent

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
onent
 
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
it's if you're if you're a government
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
employee has a different number so I
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what it's called but
 
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
it's like an IRA it's a Deferred Comp so
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
you're not paying taxes on it when you
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
put it in you pay taxes when you take it
 
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
out so I think people
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
um people come from different places in
 
01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
terms of what points in their life they
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
are in a good position to plan for
 
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:21.059 align:start position:0%
retirement and to put money in
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
retirement so one you know some people
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
want to save as much money as they can
 
01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
um through their their whole time of
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
employment but sometimes people don't
 
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
want to put away money for retirement
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
until after they've had the opportunity
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
to for example to buy a house and
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
they're making high mortgage payments
 
01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:45.260 align:start position:0%
there are also people who have a lot of
 
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
debt from college
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
but that gave them a percentage when
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to earn more money later
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
so when they are able to put money into
 
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.589 align:start position:0%
so when they are able to put money into
retirements

01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
retirements
 
01:02:59.569 --> 01:02:59.579 align:start position:0%
you know their own retirement savings
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
should be something that they plan out
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
on themselves because P different people
 
01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:06.059 align:start position:0%
are in very different positions all
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
questions yeah well I I'd just like to
 
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
make comment I agree with representative
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
fellows and uh also this becomes their
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
money versus the retirement's money
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
and uh I agree with her 100 thank you
 
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
I I wonder if he misunderstood I
 
01:03:28.319 --> 01:03:29.770 align:start position:0%
I I wonder if he misunderstood I
money

01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:29.780 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
employees put into the retirement system
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
if they leave they can take it out
 
01:03:42.359 --> 01:03:44.450 align:start position:0%
if they leave they can take it out
but

01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
I just think for some people the
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
retirement system works so to pull them
 
01:03:53.809 --> 01:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
out isn't necessarily a good idea
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
um for other people they just you know I
 
01:03:58.730 --> 01:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
think everybody should have the
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be in the retirement
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
system and
 
01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
um if they want to make extra
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
contributions on their own they can do
 
01:04:07.859 --> 01:04:08.630 align:start position:0%
contributions on their own they can do
that

01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
but there are two very different systems
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
the retirement system gives you a
 
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
defined benefit
 
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
the when when you put your money in
 
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:20.809 align:start position:0%
the when when you put your money in
um

01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
an IRA or you put it in mutual funds
 
01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:26.420 align:start position:0%
which is where a lot of money goes
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's a contribution and you really
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
don't know what you're going to end up
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
with in the end and it depends at what
 
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
point the stock market takes a big dive
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
and when you're ready for retirement so
 
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
that is very risky I think they should
 
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to do both fine
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
Chancellor would you like to make a
 
01:04:48.599 --> 01:04:54.170 align:start position:0%
Chancellor would you like to make a
comment

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning Mark Rubinstein
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
 
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire good to see you let me just
 
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
start the preface in saying retirement
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
planning in this country is is broken
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's a serious problem the specific
 
01:05:11.809 --> 01:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
request that we made was actually for
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
our board to have the authority to make
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
a determination of the future some
 
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
future date for newly hired employees
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
not currently eligible the language that
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
has come forward is that effect of a
 
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
certain date no new employees not
 
01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
currently eligible would be in
 
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
and part part of our thinking about this
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
is that our board has a fiduciary
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility on behalf of the state an
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
effective 2007 when we became an
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
independent body politic and corporate
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
um property transfer to the
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the community college
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
system effective July 1 2011 but there
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
was never a date certain about
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
continuing as employees within the state
 
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
Employee Retirement System
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
we are going to continue to be
 
01:05:59.030 --> 01:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for anyone who's currently
 
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
in who's currently eligible anyone who
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
might be hired at a future date who's
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
already in ineligible perhaps coming
 
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
from another state agency so this is
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
going to have a very limited and slow
 
01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
effect on our finances but it was
 
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
important for our board and with that
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility to articulate
 
01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
that that need to have some measure of
 
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
control we currently do offer a 403 b
 
01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:27.370 align:start position:0%
control we currently do offer a 403 b
plan

01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:27.380 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
as well as 457 plan through Fidelity and
 
01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
the contribution of the employer is
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
eight percent and it's established by
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
our Board of Trustees the contribution
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
for employees in the state retirement
 
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
system so I have closer to 14 percent
 
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
and the determination is made by that
 
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:46.510 align:start position:0%
and the determination is made by that
board

01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
that's a almost a six percent difference
 
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
and we have no control over that so in
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
trying to manage long-term expenses this
 
01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:57.299 align:start position:0%
is a area of responsibility the board
 
01:06:59.809 --> 01:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
has and that's the basis for
 
01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
articulating the request initially that
 
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
if the board is accountable for this the
 
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
board should have a voice in managing
 
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
that facet of our expenses long term but
 
01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
we recognize I say for anyone currently
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
in anyone currently retired all of those
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
obligations are ours and will continue
 
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
to honor them it really was a
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
forward-looking uh stake in the ground
 
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
if you will to be again to bend that
 
01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:26.690 align:start position:0%
if you will to be again to bend that
curve

01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
curve
 
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:32.089 align:start position:0%
curve
questions

01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
um would the system have the ability to
 
01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
continue making the necessary
 
01:07:39.049 --> 01:07:39.059 align:start position:0%
contributions for the existing employees
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
without the new employees that come and
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know add their own contributions
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
because this is generally the concern
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
when you switch from a defined benefit
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
which is counting on New Years of people
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
coming in to sustain the benefits for
 
01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
the people when you take the pipeline of
 
01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
people coming in or cut it down you have
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
fewer funds you also have fewer future
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
obligations but there is a period when
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
you still have to find the existing
 
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
people are you concerned you know are
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
you comfortable handing handling that
 
01:08:09.839 --> 01:08:11.589 align:start position:0%
you comfortable handing handling that
impact

01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
the size of our Workforce in terms of
 
01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
participants eligible is probably about
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
650 people so relative to the scale of
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
the entire Workforce the number of new
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
hires in a year who are potentially
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
eligible potentially 30 or 40. I I don't
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
think that that's the math that this
 
01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
group or I should be as worried about as
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
the breadth of the State Employee
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
Retirement System obviously which is a
 
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
scary number that I'm gonna not mention
 
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
again because it's been repeated 50
 
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
times and okay I appreciate it thank you
 
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll only add that currently
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
through negotiation our staff are able
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
to make a choice between the state
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
Employee Retirement System and the 403 b
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
our full-time faculty we've not been
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
able to negotiate agreement to make that
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
an option to choose the 403 b for some
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
people the portability the ability to
 
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
trust if you will the economy of the
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
country in the world you know is is in
 
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
some ways more comforting than when they
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
look at the long-term Horizon for the
 
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
retirement system and worry about that
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
so right now we don't have the absolute
 
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
flexibility our employees don't have the
 
01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:31.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.329 --> 01:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
can you just iterate the downside to the
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
retirement system of this I mean what's
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
the impact that this will have on the
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
retirement system as it is now I'm
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
beginning to hear that you don't think
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a significant change
 
01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
well so looking at from the perspective
 
01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:52.100 align:start position:0%
of the community college system
 
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
relatively small number of new hires
 
01:09:57.169 --> 01:09:57.179 align:start position:0%
each year really won't change the
 
01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility we have for those already
 
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
retired for those who are eligible and
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
can will continue to be eligible and
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
retire over the next 10 20 30 years
 
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
um but for the State Employee Retirement
 
01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:11.219 align:start position:0%
System I think our numbers are so small
 
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
relative to the scale of other
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
participants in the state municipalities
 
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that we have a
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
significant detrimental effect and I
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
think we're sufficiently unique in
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
statute that I don't know that we become
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
the Leading Edge of other entities that
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
would would then choose to follow suit I
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
can appreciate that that would be a
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
concern but again I think we're
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
significantly sufficiently I should say
 
01:10:38.219 --> 01:10:41.510 align:start position:0%
significantly sufficiently I should say
unique

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anyone else want to
 
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
look I'm going to put her on hold for a
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.470 align:start position:0%
 
huh

01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
huh
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
I don't know how we don't make a
 
01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
recommendation don't go into full
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
Finance so if you recall I discussed
 
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
this when we first convened as far as
 
01:11:17.209 --> 01:11:17.219 align:start position:0%
how this would work
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
um the way that I think all divisions
 
01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
are treating a 4-4 vote is you're making
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
no changes to what's in house bill 2. so
 
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
you're not proposing an amendment you're
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
not proposing to delete so that section
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
would be essentially still in the
 
01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
underlying House Bill too
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
essentially surviving as the governor
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
put it forward
 
01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
is that are under that's fine with me
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that too I think that it
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
just gives the opportunity to say that
 
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
there was a question that was concerned
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
about the impact on the retirement
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
system you know in principle I support
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
this but just with that you know the
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal mind that I have to feel I feel I
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
have to say that
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
um we don't under I don't understand how
 
01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
this would affect the retirement system
 
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
I can believe that it's probably not a
 
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
lot because it's a huge system and
 
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a few people who
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
may not want to participate and there'll
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
be people who will so I think it's just
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to say there was a
 
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
question about how this would impact the
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
while I cannot put numbers on that
 
01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
because that would require a deeper dive
 
01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
into Actuarial data I can I'm very
 
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
comfortable saying that any one employee
 
01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
that could enter the retirement system
 
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
choosing instead a non-retirement system
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
option or being over that choice only
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
would result in a short-term downside
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
because their contributions would not be
 
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
there but a net savings over time
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
because at the end we wouldn't have the
 
01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
obligations that we have that right now
 
01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
we have underfunded so it would be a
 
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
short-term loss for a significant
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
long-term gain but again I'm not going
 
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
to put dollar numbers on it because that
 
01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.270 align:start position:0%
to put dollar numbers on it because that
requires

01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
requires
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
apologies in return just for a point of
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
clarification as it's currently written
 
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2.
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
ccs and H community colleges will no
 
01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
longer be an eligible employer after
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
this date so there would not be the
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
choice to be in or out
 
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to leave this group with
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
that confusion as I said earlier
 
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
currently our full-time faculty also
 
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
don't have a choice to be in or out our
 
01:13:31.729 --> 01:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
staff have agreed to give one another
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
that option of being in or out but for
 
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
some folks the need to be here for 10
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
years to be vested is a barrier it makes
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
us a less attractive employer than
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
others because some folks have plans to
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
be more mobile than that
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
okay well I I had forgotten that point
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
that if we if if we deadlock it stays as
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:05.390 align:start position:0%
 
sections

01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
sections
 
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
eight and nine so yes the next two areas
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
of the UNH interoperability lab
 
01:14:13.729 --> 01:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the Whittemore Center
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation we haven't officially
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
decided to keep those in modify them in
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
what's anybody feeling on this because
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
these are coming out of surplus of 23.
 
01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
these are fiscal 23 general fund
 
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
Appropriations correct
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
I you know I'll go out there to say I
 
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
support both of them
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I wish I knew what division two's
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
appropriation or you know our
 
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
part of the pie of the general fund was
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
that would make it easier for us to do
 
01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
prioritizing of these things because we
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
just don't have a clue of what what
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
money from General funds is going to be
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
allocated to division two but not
 
01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
knowing that I support both these things
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:02.209 align:start position:0%
 
comment

01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
motion oh could I just add a comment Mr
 
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
chair before we take a quick vote um my
 
01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
understanding of reviewing the testimony
 
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
is that both of the Appropriations we're
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
talking about right now have the
 
01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be a revenue generator
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
for the institution and I think uh you
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
know the small investment
 
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't say small I should say the
 
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
return on investment will be quite high
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
for for both of those opportunities and
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
so while I share Kate's concern about
 
01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
prioritization I think generally it's a
 
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
it's a wonderful opportunity for unh
 
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
to answer your question about where are
 
01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:39.350 align:start position:0%
to answer your question about where are
we

01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's just perhaps my memory is faulty
 
01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me in past Cycles at
 
01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
some point prior to this chair would pop
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
in and say division two your section of
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
your part of the general funds is this
 
01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
amount try to put you know your
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
priorities and fitted within this amount
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
of money that we're allotting you
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
um one year division one came over and
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
said we have an extra 17 million would
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
like you to put an education so there's
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
been communication around
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
this instead of you know we can make
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
this is like doing the Christmas list uh
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
which is fine except it it's makes me
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
think in a different way if I already
 
01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
have a limit of what that pot is
 
01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
okay I would just say at this point
 
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're calculating or we're
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
including things that are in the
 
01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
governor's budget for Appropriations as
 
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
already accounted for so if you wanted
 
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
to for instance fund anything on the
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
next page there
 
01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
I would say at this point the committee
 
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
should probably just consider staying
 
01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
within itself so let's I'm just going to
 
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
use round numbers there's a Civics
 
01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
appropriation for a textbook 2 million
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
if you took that out and then funded
 
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
something for 2 million on the other
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
other end that I think we're okay to
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
live in that area right now the other
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
divisions are meeting as we speak
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
they're using they're throwing around
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
much bigger numbers than we are and I
 
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
think some of these smaller decisions I
 
01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
think if whatever you want to do if you
 
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
stay within yourself you're okay uh
 
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll have a better idea at the
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
end of the day after the divisions do
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
work this morning but I
 
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're going to get a clear
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
um here's X dollars for division two
 
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
here's X dollars for division three
 
01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:21.290 align:start position:0%
here's X dollars for division three
yeah

01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
I I visited Whittemore Center I do agree
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
that they do need to get some of that
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
work done but given the amount of
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
pressure we have this is just not a high
 
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
priority for me so if you ask me to vote
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
right now I would probably vote no
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
because I just don't see where I would
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
fit it in the current we are over in
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
every category and we haven't even
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
really talked about the bills that were
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
positive require even more money some of
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
them and I I would like to be able to
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
find a way to fund it
 
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
but right now I I wouldn't be confident
 
01:17:57.169 --> 01:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
that we can find that and I don't want
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
to put it in and then take it out
 
01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.229 align:start position:0%
to put it in and then take it out
tomorrow

01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
I I think the point is that does happen
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
all the time okay once once you figure
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
out what you got because we really don't
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
know what the Surplus is going to be
 
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
no Mary
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
one point
 
01:18:18.189 --> 01:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
um the governor's office actually has
 
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
asked particularly for the 1.5 for the
 
01:18:24.169 --> 01:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab appropriation
 
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
because of the significance that it will
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
play in in the future in terms of of the
 
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
business relations that are going to
 
01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
come out of that and that they will also
 
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
want to use the Whittemore Center I
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
completely agree that um it is an
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
Enterprise facility
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
and you know what we have undercut the
 
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
university system for years and years
 
01:18:51.169 --> 01:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
and years if we couldn't do 8 million
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
maybe four million
 
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
um just cut the Appropriations in half
 
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
and and that would at least get them
 
01:18:59.630 --> 01:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
halfway there they're going to get funds
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
from other resources that's what UNH has
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
learned how to do so I wouldn't be um
 
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
opposed if we
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
um did 50 of each at this point in time
 
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
and that would give us a few extra
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
dollars uh with which to work in other
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
areas because I think there are quite a
 
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
frankly I would prefer to fully fund the
 
01:19:26.649 --> 01:19:26.659 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab
 
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
and you know cut a little bit more from
 
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
the Whittemore Center which I'm willing
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
to cut to zero right now
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
but I think the weaker mode the
 
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab is to me a higher
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
priority because it has much more of a
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
strategic importance in terms of
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
education and developing business
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities and all that
 
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
the whittlemore center again I wish I I
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
will continue working to find a way to
 
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
get it done but I right now I don't see
 
01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
I would suggest
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
um since this University money
 
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
um I have you know two possibilities one
 
01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
um that we cut the Whittemore center of
 
01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 million to fully fund the inter
 
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
interoperability but that leaves the 6.5
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
um towards the Whittemore Center which I
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
prefer to the 50 but the other thing I'd
 
01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:20.219 align:start position:0%
consider and um
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
Nikki reminded me the I can't I'm the
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
Civics appropriation is the two million
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
dollars they can do that on their own
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
and to put that 2 million back up which
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
would get us back to fully funding the
 
01:20:33.649 --> 01:20:33.659 align:start position:0%
whittlemore center and on inoperability
 
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
but I think the Civics money is money
 
01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
that can be found privately and it's a
 
01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
other opinions no opinion I just uh no I
 
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
think uh interoperability I'll move that
 
01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
I think we have the support for that uh
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
let's move and get it out of the way so
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
this leaving it at 1.5 million exactly
 
01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
second all those in favor
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
okay one down
 
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
swinging hard
 
01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh 64 and 65 section
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Education computer science
 
01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.729 align:start position:0%
Department of Education computer science
Appropriations

01:21:22.729 --> 01:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
01:21:22.739 --> 01:21:25.130 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
uh

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
and then the next one was the commission
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Civics appropriation
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
7 million approximately
 
01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
and if you throw in teacher of the year
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
it is seven million
 
01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
yes so I think if we even go up to 62
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
um that was not a request from the doe
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
62 63 64 through 65.
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
um I think that was amended
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
64 and 65 Mickey yeah so we we adopted
 
01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
an amendment earlier in the process here
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
to split some of the money out of one of
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations to fund the position
 
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
if you recall that newly established
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
position had no funding Associated to it
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
so there's an amendment later on if the
 
01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
intent here is to revisit all this we
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
would supersede that Amendment with
 
01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
whatever we're looking to do I'm good
 
01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
so we left enough in to fund the
 
01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:30.229 align:start position:0%
so we left enough in to fund the
position

01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
as part of that 4.955 million dollars is
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
that in
 
01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
but eliminate 62 and 63 because they're
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to be starting their work and
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
we've put in a position so really they
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
need a little time to get off the ground
 
01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
so I think we could live with us the 62
 
01:22:57.410 --> 01:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
and 63 lines
 
01:22:59.570 --> 01:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
but we again there was no change on that
 
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
week we accepted it previously I
 
01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.010 align:start position:0%
week we accepted it previously I
understand

01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
we did and and the Appropriations in
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
section 64 tied to
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
that program and the administrator
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
position so okay uh you may want to we
 
01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
may just want to actually go through the
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
language I'm not sure if you want to set
 
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
up a program without any money they
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
might not I don't know that's up to it's
 
01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
up to you but the money for that program
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
is the 4.955 that's and those are the
 
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
positions and the position is funded by
 
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
that too
 
01:23:33.729 --> 01:23:33.739 align:start position:0%
all right then you skip down to uh
 
01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:37.460 align:start position:0%
86 sections 86 through 88 which is the
 
01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
commission of New Hampshire Civics
 
01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:42.590 align:start position:0%
commission of New Hampshire Civics
appropriation

01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
we amended that by doing what I don't I
 
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
don't remember
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
we we made it so at least one of the
 
01:23:51.649 --> 01:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
public members appointed by the governor
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
was a parent of a child in a New
 
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire education program that was the
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
and that amendment is in your packets
 
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
here too
 
01:24:06.169 --> 01:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
yes page 12.
 
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with the commission but I would
 
01:24:09.649 --> 01:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
pull out the money for the book
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay that's easily raised by private
 
01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.290 align:start position:0%
okay that's easily raised by private
funds

01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes if I may um there is a very
 
01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
active Civics group in the state
 
01:24:22.679 --> 01:24:24.830 align:start position:0%
active Civics group in the state
um and

01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
I I don't know why we actually need this
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
again it's
 
01:24:31.729 --> 01:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
where the
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
general court is not in the practice of
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
normally dictating curriculum and and I
 
01:24:39.169 --> 01:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's the intent of this
 
01:24:40.729 --> 01:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
book that's going to come out
 
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
but I think we could live without that 2
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
million appropriation
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
if we if we zero that out
 
01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
is that two million can be used on the
 
01:24:52.729 --> 01:24:52.739 align:start position:0%
second page
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean essentially I'd say in the
 
01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
in those dollars that we're talking
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
about just a couple million whether it's
 
01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
23 24 25 you can assume you can use that
 
01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
in the other years yes
 
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
if I may make a suggestion would it be
 
01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:08.219 align:start position:0%
more productive to go to the second page
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
and see what we want to add and that
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
would help us figure out what we may
 
01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
want to cut
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
well it's just I'm I'm finding either
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
way but it would look to me like I would
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
want to know what I want to add before I
 
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
I mean right now it's in the budget we
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
can cut it anytime
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
if we need to
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable just going through this
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
because I think I can use a refresher
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
and we've added more information we've
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
learned something so there may be things
 
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
we need to revisit
 
01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:49.970 align:start position:0%
we need to revisit
well

01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
I I'm going along with the idea that
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
getting in the book writing business is
 
01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
probably not the best legislative action
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
we can take
 
01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.410 align:start position:0%
we can take
so

01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:03.169 --> 01:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
I would make that motion that we just we
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
removed that line okay from hb2 and
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
funding associated with it
 
01:26:12.169 --> 01:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
about the commission
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
there's already an active
 
01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:17.450 align:start position:0%
there's already an active
um

01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
they're very active group led by I think
 
01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
but you know I'm fine with the
 
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
commission um if we you know I think
 
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
it's fine to say we think this is
 
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
important but I agree with the chair
 
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to do the book but to
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
support the concept I'm totally fine
 
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:40.139 align:start position:0%
with that could somebody remind me if
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
that 2 million was all for the book
 
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
development or part of it was for the
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
commission operations I would appreciate
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
the refresher on that
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
it just says for the purposes of
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
creating a New Hampshire Civics textbook
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
to be distributed to every New Hampshire
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
Civics classroom that's the purpose of
 
01:26:59.810 --> 01:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:01.149 align:start position:0%
 
hi

01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:27:03.490 --> 01:27:03.500 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
01:27:07.729 --> 01:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.739 --> 01:27:09.290 align:start position:0%
 
or

01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
we're glad April years ago when I was a
 
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
principal over in Maine and I was also
 
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
working with the Maine legislature and
 
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
their state cultural activities there
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
I wrote a curriculum for that state in
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
conjunction with a state Grant and
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
federal monies which are available which
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
is the main studies curriculum project
 
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
since that date the poll Project's been
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
bought out by DownEast magazine
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
the copyright the whole nine yards I
 
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
didn't get anything out of it but I
 
01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
think that's appropriate that if we get
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
into this curriculum writing business
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's a way to do this already
 
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
established through your grant writing
 
01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
and receiving those types of dollars but
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
in conjunction of working with or other
 
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
organizations as well I I you know in
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
terms of where we are in education right
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
here this is not on the top of our
 
01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
priority list
 
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
let's put a tick mark by that one to say
 
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
if we need it on the subsequent pages
 
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
that one disappears
 
01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:21.139 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:28:24.169 --> 01:28:24.179 align:start position:0%
along with the
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
kittens but at the teacher of the year
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
and no changes to the computer science
 
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
appropriation at this point either
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
keeping that as we've previously
 
01:28:39.719 --> 01:28:40.850 align:start position:0%
keeping that as we've previously
okay

01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
and if we go down then to the Department
 
01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
of Transportation
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
that one would go forward but because
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're a hung jury on that one
 
01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.729 --> 01:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
no there's no money in it it's just it's
 
01:28:58.739 --> 01:28:59.570 align:start position:0%
no there's no money in it it's just it's
just

01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
it's just what it says I'm sorry yeah
 
01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
now can we uh I hate to do it uh we've
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
gotten pushed back on the northern
 
01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
border Alliance program
 
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
they don't want it up there
 
01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy you know I I'm uh happy to
 
01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
support safety and all that but
 
01:29:20.209 --> 01:29:20.219 align:start position:0%
um there's been pushback about whether
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
or not there's need and there just don't
 
01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
seem to
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
so you know it may be something we can
 
01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.629 align:start position:0%
so you know it may be something we can
reconsider

01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
01:29:29.689 --> 01:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
um I was supportive of it I
 
01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:32.219 align:start position:0%
can see that maybe it's not a necessary
 
01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
thing and I can certainly hear that some
 
01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
people are bothered by it but anyway
 
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
just for put it on the floor okay
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to concur with
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I too have gotten
 
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of um emails uh asking that we
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
revisit that vote that we took and if
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
possible delete that from the section as
 
01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:53.699 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
so we got four potentially on The
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
any any other items on this page of what
 
01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to reconsider
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of them we did we went no change
 
01:30:08.639 --> 01:30:17.090 align:start position:0%
a lot of them we did we went no change
so

01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:26.780 align:start position:0%
oh that was moving a position from
 
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
HHS to the fire marshal okay yeah yeah
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
so if you remember uh Department of
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
Safety had mentioned that there was a
 
01:30:36.169 --> 01:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
couple of sections in-house Bill 2
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
related to this and this one they
 
01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
recommended to be deleted there's
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
another section that's assigned to
 
01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
division three that they said does what
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
they need to do okay yep yep yep
 
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
suspension of RSA relative to
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
appropriations of Highway funds and
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's the compliance section that we
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
talked about so when the when you're
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
done making your decisions with the
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
highway fund all determine if we need to
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
keep that in there or not okay and I
 
01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:15.900 align:start position:0%
don't think we will need to keep it in
 
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:17.699 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and distribution
 
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
same thing uh that one's a little
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
different this essentially uh goes to
 
01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:22.550 align:start position:0%
different this essentially uh goes to
the

01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
proposal that representative Weiler was
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
discussing as far as shifting a lot of
 
01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
programs from the education trust fund
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
to the general fund right so this this
 
01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
amendment if you know or an amendment to
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
this section would be in love to if
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
represent Weiler is going to propose
 
01:31:38.209 --> 01:31:38.219 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
01:31:40.189 --> 01:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
so that's why that's open at this point
 
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
everything from 171 through 177
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'll take care of depending on what we
 
01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
do with Ed funding with adequacy
 
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
and then 210 to 11 may also get rolled
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
into representative Weiler's uh proposal
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
relative to education trust fund uses
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the revenue that goes into the
 
01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
education trust fund okay
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Hall's amendment is still
 
01:32:09.169 --> 01:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
pending as long as along with the issue
 
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
of school building Aid which we haven't
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
really settled on that yet we have a
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
couple of bills that are retained in the
 
01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:14.689 align:start position:0%
couple of bills that are retained in the
committee

01:32:14.689 --> 01:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
we're probably not in a place to dive
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
into that now unless unless you are I
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
don't know I think I think we heard some
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh we had some comments on
 
01:32:24.770 --> 01:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative hole's Amendment and I
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be in drafting to
 
01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:28.139 align:start position:0%
clean up a couple of those concerns and
 
01:32:29.689 --> 01:32:29.699 align:start position:0%
represent it to division two for
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
consideration okay
 
01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:34.250 align:start position:0%
consideration okay
when

01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
so those comments came to me uh
 
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
yesterday and this morning I'm just
 
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
asking how much more time do we have I
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
think tomorrow is the hard deadline to
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
make any decisions or I'm just trying
 
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
yeah that's it okay so okay we'll soon
 
01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:50.510 align:start position:0%
yeah that's it okay so okay we'll soon
see

01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
today and tomorrow the party ends
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:02.149 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
be of Sugar Hill Technical Center we
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
need to make a decision on that role at
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
gym right all right I had that as we had
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
decided to keep those sections in yeah
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
but keep it in okay and I will say this
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
may be impacted by
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative weilers and his what he
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
wants to do with ETF and general funds
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
so the amount would still be funded but
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
this may be one of the programs that
 
01:33:26.209 --> 01:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
shifts to the general fund
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
yes a question about this
 
01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:29.149 align:start position:0%
yes a question about this
um

01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
no we know that we have a number of
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
items that we've decided to pay
 
01:33:39.649 --> 01:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
or to fill using the education trust if
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're representative Weiler's amendments
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
should succeed
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
what happens does that mean we have to
 
01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:49.139 align:start position:0%
shift all those dollars that we had
 
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
intended for the education trust into
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
the general fund correct
 
01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.810 align:start position:0%
the general fund correct
correct

01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
isn't it
 
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
inquiring him about this
 
01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
the answer I got was the original
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula they had to set up the
 
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
trust fund to satisfy the court
 
01:34:14.570 --> 01:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
right and but it's grown because of the
 
01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:15.770 align:start position:0%
right and but it's grown because of the
contributions

01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
and so now it's become the education
 
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
slush fund
 
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
so the idea was to get back to what it
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
was originally attended so because of
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
what's Happening money goes into this
 
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
yes so if I may
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
this presents a real challenge because
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden we're moving millions of
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
dollars into the general fund which
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
apparently we're going to be very
 
01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
stretched for
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
could we do this if in fact
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler's motion passes
 
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
and succeeds could we as a one time for
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
this biennium use the trust for the
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
purposes originally intended
 
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
only in this biennium and then if
 
01:35:03.290 --> 01:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
everybody votes to agree to limit what
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
goes into the education trust in the
 
01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:07.860 align:start position:0%
next biennium but maintain it for this
 
01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:09.169 align:start position:0%
next biennium but maintain it for this
biennium

01:35:09.169 --> 01:35:09.179 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
all depends on his motion
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
I can solicit that
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
and that's essentially just changing the
 
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
effective date of his amendment to one
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
July 25 is we'll get to the essence of
 
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
that I I don't see that as making any
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
real difference at this point in time
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
just my personal opinion because at the
 
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
end of the day it's this community that
 
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
will decide both on the funding and
 
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
doing the expenditures and whether we
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
take it from one pocket to the other you
 
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
know it's still the same amount of money
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
we are planning to spend
 
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh if I may it does significantly impact
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
our work because every time we take
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
something out of the education trust
 
01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.830 align:start position:0%
something out of the education trust
fund

01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:35:51.169 --> 01:35:51.179 align:start position:0%
it goes into the general fund so that
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
means there's something in the general
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
fund that isn't going to get funded
 
01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:57.179 align:start position:0%
because we've moved a significant amount
 
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
of money so if we were to
 
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:01.860 align:start position:0%
excuse me if I just let me finish please
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
we the general fund is its own pot of
 
01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.870 align:start position:0%
we the general fund is its own pot of
money

01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
education trust has uses that have been
 
01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:10.310 align:start position:0%
education trust has uses that have been
defined

01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
defined
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
for this biennium so if we could retain
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
them in this biennium
 
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
and then the changes would be impacted
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
with the new date
 
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
as a effective 25
 
01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:26.629 align:start position:0%
as a effective 25
Mickey

01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
Mickey
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
um then it would not it
 
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
it would make us it would make it really
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
difficult for us let's say for example
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to put enough money in
 
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
building aid for those two other
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
projects that we'd like to see get
 
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
funded we wouldn't be able to use that
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
building we wouldn't be able to use
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
education trust money for that purpose
 
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
because it's in the trust if it's in the
 
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
general fund we can't take education
 
01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
trust money and put it into the general
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
fund we can take general fund money and
 
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
put it in the trust but not the other
 
01:36:58.970 --> 01:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
way around that's why it would really
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
we'd be in a conundrum of what we can
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
fund and what we can't fund it's much
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
easier if we keep education trust as is
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
for now and then in the future whatever
 
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
they decide then we can account for that
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
in the preparation of the budget process
 
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
first I want to say that I had no
 
01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
intention of interrupting I merely raise
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
my hand to say let the chairman know
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
that I would like to follow up I
 
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
obviously you know want to make sure
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
that everybody gets to finish what they
 
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
want to say every time thank you of
 
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
course and I I just wanna I I hear what
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
you are saying but in this case to me it
 
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
looks like we are moving both the
 
01:37:43.129 --> 01:37:43.139 align:start position:0%
revenues and the expenditures from one
 
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
pocket to the other it doesn't change
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
the total amount of Revenue or the total
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
amount of expenditures it just changes
 
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
whether they come from a restricted
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
order unrestricted pocket
 
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
or this biennium so that's what I was
 
01:37:58.610 --> 01:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
trying to say that you know it doesn't
 
01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
really change the bottom line in any way
 
01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
but I do completely acknowledge that it
 
01:38:05.209 --> 01:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
changes the nature of the pocket we are
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
planning to spend from and that may have
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
impact on future
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
um legislatures thank you
 
01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:16.550 align:start position:0%
um legislatures thank you
okay

01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
what what item did you ask about oh
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
Sugar Hill yes yes all right a lot
 
01:38:25.729 --> 01:38:25.739 align:start position:0%
coming out of here yes and it would come
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
out of the trust I believe yeah and the
 
01:38:30.169 --> 01:38:30.179 align:start position:0%
other the other CTE is coming out of uh
 
01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
capital budget yes and they're talking
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
when a Squam is currently in the capital
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
budget yeah this yeah this came out of
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
this is coming out of here because there
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
is extra money in the education trust
 
01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
funds and that's why the governor put it
 
01:38:52.610 --> 01:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:56.169 --> 01:38:56.179 align:start position:0%
even though it's a capital all right
 
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
we can all argue all right go to page
 
01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:03.649 align:start position:0%
we can all argue all right go to page
three

01:39:03.649 --> 01:39:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.649 --> 01:39:06.659 align:start position:0%
so just a refresher these are mostly
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
requests that the agencies brought
 
01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
forward to you most of them are
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs that were
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
also in their agency budget requests
 
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
brought to the governor that were not
 
01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
included in the governor's recommended
 
01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
budget so about 85 to 90 percent of
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
these are are things that have been
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
requests for a little bit of time now
 
01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
through this process I will point you
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
briefly to one on line 18.
 
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
so if you remember the department of
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
safety had talked about the costs of
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
their credit card acceptance that DMV
 
01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
was getting a little out of control so
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:39:37.679 --> 01:39:38.209 align:start position:0%
rather than
um

01:39:38.209 --> 01:39:38.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
Levy a convenience fee or a surcharge to
 
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
the users or to the consumers customers
 
01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:45.179 align:start position:0%
they had asked for some additional
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation to cover those those fees
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
I can tell you they do have an item that
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
they're bringing to the fiscal committee
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
this Friday to draw from the highway
 
01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
fund to cover those costs for this year
 
01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
assuming that's approved by fiscal
 
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
this request would essentially carry on
 
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
that that funding policy if you will for
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
the next for the next two years
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
you would have to act on this so this
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
would this would give them the money for
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 the money they're coming for
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
for fiscal would only be for this year
 
01:40:18.530 --> 01:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
oh oh what can you know just just a
 
01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:20.629 align:start position:0%
oh oh what can you know just just a
moment

01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
um every other entity it seems in the
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
world charges something for their credit
 
01:40:28.129 --> 01:40:28.139 align:start position:0%
card fees and I'm a little baffled as to
 
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
why the DMV doesn't add that cost to the
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
cost of you know that when we go you pay
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
the credit card fee when you go out for
 
01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
dinner when you buy clothes you're
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
paying the credit card fee if you use
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
your credit card and why DMV doesn't add
 
01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
that on it seems to me this is an
 
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
internal issue where they could cover
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
this themselves if they charge for the
 
01:40:48.179 --> 01:40:50.050 align:start position:0%
this themselves if they charge for the
fee

01:40:50.050 --> 01:40:50.060 align:start position:0%
fee
 
01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
I've I've dealt with that in the town of
 
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
Windham so I can shed some light into
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
that Merchants can set their prices to
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
anything they want and yes if they want
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
to keep a hundred dollars they charge
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
you 102 knowing that two dollars will go
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
to the credit card company our fees are
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
set by Statute so we don't have the
 
01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
option to add that right without
 
01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
increasing and disclosing it separately
 
01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
in the town of Windham we did do exactly
 
01:41:20.890 --> 01:41:20.900 align:start position:0%
that we basically
 
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
allowed our town clerk and our tax
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
collector to charge an additional fee of
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
two point something percent on top of
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
the transaction so that is an option but
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
as long as it's clearly disclosed they
 
01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
could do that I think they are looking
 
01:41:37.370 --> 01:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
to do this because they would rather not
 
01:41:39.290 --> 01:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
you know increase the costs on the
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
people who are using credit cards so
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
frankly are probably the ones who
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
can list the 40 additional fees I mean
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
people who use credit cards
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
because they cannot write a check you
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
know they are the ones who have a hard
 
01:41:56.209 --> 01:41:56.219 align:start position:0%
time you know paying for anything
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
01:42:04.729 --> 01:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
if I may clarify so that we eliminate
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
this apparent confusion
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
there are two major reasons for using a
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
credit card people like me who pay in
 
01:42:13.609 --> 01:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
full every month and love to get their
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
1.5 or 2 percent cash back absolutely
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
that is me I specifically said the
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
people who use credit cards because they
 
01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
cannot pay through you know direct means
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
the people who carry a balance
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
those are two different categories of
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
people I never implied that all of them
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
belong to one pocket I was talking about
 
01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
the specific Pockets who would do this
 
01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
out of need rather of you know Financial
 
01:42:41.209 --> 01:42:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
so it's an Appropriations so and I will
 
01:42:47.810 --> 01:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
jump let's jump to page seven real quick
 
01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'll show you what's going on with the
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
highway fund it's going to look a little
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
different than our last uh our last
 
01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.590 align:start position:0%
different than our last uh our last
handout

01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
handout
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
so also in addition to the Department of
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
Safety request for additional Highway
 
01:43:01.850 --> 01:43:01.860 align:start position:0%
funds for fiscal 23 there's also a DOT
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance item for just over
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
six million dollars I've accounted those
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
under the presumption they will clear
 
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
fiscal and Governor Council which brings
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
your balance I think it was 12.9 Million
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
last time we met just over 6.3 million
 
01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
now in the highway fund so as you make
 
01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
Highway fund decisions that's our
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
balance that we're working from at this
 
01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:22.550 align:start position:0%
balance that we're working from at this
point

01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's been we've had multiple budgets
 
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
here in the last few years where uh
 
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
General funds can be transferred into
 
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
the highway fund so when you see let's
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
say hypothetically you wanted to reduce
 
01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
the Civics textbook and give Department
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
of Transportation two million dollars I
 
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
can make that happen so don't worry that
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
a request says Highway funds but you're
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
cutting General funds and you know I can
 
01:43:48.649 --> 01:43:48.659 align:start position:0%
I can do the technical component to do a
 
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
fund transfer in House Bill too to make
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
that work does that sound like a
 
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable trade-off
 
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
and and maybe that's fine for me and I
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
think maybe what we do is just
 
01:43:59.810 --> 01:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
tentatively think about these things and
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
put put a sheet together that kind of
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
makes it clear if you're making
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
reductions in ads okay you know I'll
 
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
document that I don't want too many
 
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
things flying around that it's unclear
 
01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
the work we're doing so so are we going
 
01:44:15.229 --> 01:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
and improving this then
 
01:44:17.450 --> 01:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
so so the two million dollar for which
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
one now this would be the Division of
 
01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles yeah
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying the Safety Division and
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
the highway fund okay
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
we're moving the two million dollars
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund and that was a
 
01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
hypothetical two million dollars so uh
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
so I mean you could you could and it
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
would Shore up the highway funds but
 
01:44:46.129 --> 01:44:46.139 align:start position:0%
isn't it that was just my example of I
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
can turn General funds into Highway
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
funds you know just with a fund transfer
 
01:44:56.330 --> 01:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
for looking at Line 6 18 is that is that
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
the line you're having us
 
01:45:06.169 --> 01:45:06.179 align:start position:0%
on page three it's just I'm having you
 
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
consider this I just wanted to give you
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
that information about that they're
 
01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward to fiscal
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
committee this week for fiscal 23. so uh
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
under the presumption that it passes
 
01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
fiscal they'd have funds to pay for in
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
23. this request here is that they'd
 
01:45:24.649 --> 01:45:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.209 --> 01:45:26.219 align:start position:0%
so they're going to go to fish gallon
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
Hawaii so we might as well prove it and
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
get it out of the way
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
well if we're saying there's a fly on
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
the baby's head get a hammer
 
01:45:35.689 --> 01:45:35.699 align:start position:0%
I mean they're asking for two hundred
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
thousand you you reference two million
 
01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:38.930 align:start position:0%
thousand you you reference two million
dollars

01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
well I know the two million was just uh
 
01:45:42.649 --> 01:45:42.659 align:start position:0%
that is because that's how much the
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
Civics textbook was so that's why all
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
right that was just a hypothetical
 
01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.689 align:start position:0%
right that was just a hypothetical
so

01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:47.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:47.699 --> 01:45:49.189 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:52.609 --> 01:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
you you could um you could accept 18 if
 
01:45:54.169 --> 01:45:54.179 align:start position:0%
that's what you wanted to do and I'll
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
still keep everyone updated on that
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
status of the highway fund and if you
 
01:45:58.370 --> 01:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
need to move General funds in there at
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
show of hands
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
um the people from the community college
 
01:46:11.689 --> 01:46:11.699 align:start position:0%
are here and I think they have some
 
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
information that they want to share with
 
01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%
us about some of the items that we have
 
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
to make decisions on okay so that might
 
01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
be something I think we can easily work
 
01:46:19.619 --> 01:46:21.169 align:start position:0%
be something I think we can easily work
through

01:46:21.169 --> 01:46:21.179 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:46:21.179 --> 01:46:31.970 align:start position:0%
through
please

01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:33.850 --> 01:46:33.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
Mark Rubinstein community college system
 
01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
good to see you all again a couple of
 
01:46:44.050 --> 01:46:44.060 align:start position:0%
things on the list uh item uh 50
 
01:46:46.810 --> 01:46:46.820 align:start position:0%
Workforce credentials
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
this is primarily for working adults and
 
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
currently the federal government is
 
01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
looking at a couple of different bills
 
01:46:56.450 --> 01:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
that might or might not survive
 
01:46:58.850 --> 01:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
legislative process federal financial
 
01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:01.139 align:start position:0%
aid doesn't support this this is a
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
critical opportunity and something that
 
01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
we can tailor whether it's hospitality
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
or health care to different needs around
 
01:47:09.490 --> 01:47:09.500 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
even the opportunity to Pilot this
 
01:47:14.330 --> 01:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
because currently there's not support as
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
I said in in federal programs for this
 
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
if we could reduce that to a million
 
01:47:21.649 --> 01:47:21.659 align:start position:0%
dollars that would give us the
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to probably work with
 
01:47:25.129 --> 01:47:25.139 align:start position:0%
between five and six hundred adults
 
01:47:27.649 --> 01:47:27.659 align:start position:0%
across the state to work on credentials
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
again tailored to different areas of the
 
01:47:31.850 --> 01:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
state different Industries to move
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
people up in the workforce
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
my preference would be to take the two
 
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
million dollar Civics book and put a
 
01:47:44.890 --> 01:47:44.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that basically I I would
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
like to support this type of program as
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
much as possible because having been
 
01:47:52.729 --> 01:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
involved in that type of training I know
 
01:47:54.649 --> 01:47:54.659 align:start position:0%
what the difference it can make for
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
people who want to change a career or
 
01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
acquire a skill or just move in a
 
01:47:59.330 --> 01:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
different direction it's the kind of
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the workforce that we
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
desperately need at all times people
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
shift careers all the time we should
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
support that
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
okay show hands everybody on that reason
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'm supporting it but could we hear the
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
entire story I don't know that's just
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
one item yeah so I would like to hear
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know the whole the Gestalt
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
okay and the other one I'd like to speak
 
01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
to is in row 52 which is identified as
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
tuition reset and promise program when
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
we put this proposal together originally
 
01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh early in the budget cycle we were
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
working with some rough estimates I'd
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
like to refine that to three million
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
dollars from the eight that's there
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
three million in each year this would
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
serve between 1200 and 1500 students
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
primarily more traditional age students
 
01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
18 to 25. this is an opportunity to
 
01:48:58.129 --> 01:48:58.139 align:start position:0%
remove cost as a barrier for students
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
who are prepared to move through in
 
01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
relatively uh good order this ties to
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do with House Bill
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
420 the Dual and concurrent enrollment
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
it ties to what was accomplished last
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
year with how to house bill 1530
 
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
building Pathways between the community
 
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
college system and University system
 
01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
again serving primarily more traditional
 
01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
age students but the opportunity to
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
remove cost and facilitate timely
 
01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
completion to degrees at both two-year
 
01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.890 --> 01:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
combination of changes to the federal
 
01:49:36.609 --> 01:49:36.619 align:start position:0%
Pell Grant and also
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
looking at other sources of support for
 
01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
this we think that we can accomplish
 
01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
this at three million dollars a year
 
01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
rather than the eight we originally
 
01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.310 align:start position:0%
rather than the eight we originally
proposed

01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
now this can come out of uh education
 
01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:51.649 align:start position:0%
now this can come out of uh education
Trust

01:49:51.649 --> 01:49:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.659 --> 01:49:54.770 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
either way
 
01:49:58.970 --> 01:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to spend that money down I
 
01:50:00.649 --> 01:50:00.659 align:start position:0%
know but I think I'm going to change the
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
formula there will be less in the
 
01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
education it's finding from the general
 
01:50:06.290 --> 01:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
let's let's not worry about the funding
 
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
for oh I'm sorry go ahead
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to see
 
01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
will find the money either pocket if we
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
decide to find the money okay the the
 
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
pocket will be figured out reasonably
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
straightforwardly I do think that this
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
is a very important program again those
 
01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
are people who do need help and you know
 
01:50:28.129 --> 01:50:28.139 align:start position:0%
I think we should continue to maintain
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
the tuition rates uh as flat as possible
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
because people are having a harder time
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
making ends meet and they need the
 
01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:38.229 align:start position:0%
making ends meet and they need the
support

01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
I have a question yes sir do you have
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
any employees that are working in a
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
program called diversity equity and
 
01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:50.209 align:start position:0%
program called diversity equity and
inclusion

01:50:50.209 --> 01:50:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe we have anyone for
 
01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
whom that is a role or a title doesn't
 
01:50:57.410 --> 01:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
mean that we don't value inclusion
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we don't care about
 
01:51:01.129 --> 01:51:01.139 align:start position:0%
the full spectrum of people that we
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
serve as students and whose work
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
benefits the state
 
01:51:08.209 --> 01:51:08.219 align:start position:0%
it's become a very negative program I
 
01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
don't like to see it anywhere and I see
 
01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
it in your marketing
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
I don't like to it's it's just become a
 
01:51:14.689 --> 01:51:14.699 align:start position:0%
very negative
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
thing that that many of us are averse to
 
01:51:19.609 --> 01:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
so I hope you'll stop using it in your
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
marketing well I'm not entirely sure the
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
connotation my my point remains that we
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
have responsibility to every resident
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and our
 
01:51:34.490 --> 01:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
efforts are to ensure that we're serving
 
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
all of them and so I don't know where
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
the how I would Implement what you've
 
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
just described well we've always done
 
01:51:45.649 --> 01:51:45.659 align:start position:0%
that but I mean why is it important to
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
list the ethnicity of people in each of
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not sure where that's listed
 
01:52:03.590 --> 01:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
we collect data for the federal
 
01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
oh then based on the federal data we
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
collect based on the federal data that
 
01:52:19.010 --> 01:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's racist to me that everybody has to
 
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
be identified by a race
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:29.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:52:29.530 --> 01:52:29.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'll take your point but as I said we
 
01:52:35.689 --> 01:52:35.699 align:start position:0%
collect the data because the federal
 
01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
government asked us to collect the data
 
01:52:39.590 --> 01:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
we share the information so that people
 
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
understand the scope of our work
 
01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:44.820 align:start position:0%
well I'm just a verse I see the whole
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
program as being averse to what we
 
01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
believe is we're all equal
 
01:52:51.709 --> 01:52:51.719 align:start position:0%
okay do you have any other items you'd
 
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
like to highlight no those are the two
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
yes did I hear you correctly
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
um Chancellor that you said
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
um your original ask was for 8 million a
 
01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
year but you understand you can run the
 
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
program through the 3 million that
 
01:53:09.770 --> 01:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
you've subsequently asked for part of
 
01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
this is sharper pencils part of this is
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh changes to the federal Pell grant
 
01:53:16.370 --> 01:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
part of this is identifying other
 
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
sources that we can draw funds from
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
including unique in the governor's
 
01:53:35.530 --> 01:53:35.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:38.689 --> 01:53:38.699 align:start position:0%
and so you're you're more or less
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
withdrawing the solar and the critical
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance yes and critical maintenance
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh believe maybe interest through Public
 
01:53:48.490 --> 01:53:48.500 align:start position:0%
Works and the solar will will
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
hold on that and one thing we've done I
 
01:53:54.169 --> 01:53:54.179 align:start position:0%
think in the past and correct me if not
 
01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
it's only the the you're only focusing
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
on these two products now or programs
 
01:53:58.500 --> 01:53:59.629 align:start position:0%
on these two products now or programs
now

01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
um with reduced amounts what we've done
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
in some instances is to say we can find
 
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
this amount of money to give to you for
 
01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:09.719 align:start position:0%
these programs you divide them up how
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
best you think it would work for your
 
01:54:11.159 --> 01:54:12.770 align:start position:0%
best you think it would work for your
situation

01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
so it's just another option which gives
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
them a little more flexibility
 
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion to uh allocate
 
01:54:23.209 --> 01:54:23.219 align:start position:0%
to reduce that well but you've got to
 
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
we've got to figure out where's it
 
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
now it's got to come from somewhere all
 
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
right then give me a moment
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
oh I know what I have come on I've
 
01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
already told you about waitamor for now
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to make a motion to
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
allocate the six million dollars and uh
 
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
that are needed for the tuition reset
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
over the biennium
 
01:54:48.290 --> 01:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
and cut with a more completely for now
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
which would leave us with two more
 
01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
million because I'm sure we'll have
 
01:54:54.370 --> 01:54:54.380 align:start position:0%
other things that we'll want to put in
 
01:54:57.770 --> 01:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
that's basically two motions I'm fine
 
01:54:59.570 --> 01:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
with two separate motions and I would
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
respectfully wait until we have uh a
 
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
overview list to be able to see because
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know if we're going this way it's
 
01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
kind of you know whack-a-mole that we
 
01:55:09.410 --> 01:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
decide this oh but then there's this we
 
01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:11.820 align:start position:0%
have to deal with this I'd rather see um
 
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
a larger spreadsheet about where we are
 
01:55:15.649 --> 01:55:15.659 align:start position:0%
now things that we've decided we're not
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to do on one side and things that
 
01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
we still like on the other side I think
 
01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
it helps to see the overall picture
 
01:55:23.689 --> 01:55:23.699 align:start position:0%
instead of um you know to me this is
 
01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
playing whack-a-mole
 
01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
other items on page three
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's Mary well based on the testimony
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
we're cutting we're
 
01:55:35.639 --> 01:55:37.189 align:start position:0%
we're cutting we're
um

01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
getting rid of item 54 53
 
01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
then we're moving the Reset program for
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
3 million in each year the biennium for
 
01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
6 million
 
01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
and then we're looking at the credential
 
01:55:55.129 --> 01:55:55.139 align:start position:0%
program at 1 million in each year with
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
the biennium so that would be two
 
01:55:59.330 --> 01:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
million that one was voted on already
 
01:56:01.250 --> 01:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
I would
 
01:56:06.050 --> 01:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
accept that as a motion please
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
um that we um
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
as follows I think they've said that we
 
01:56:13.729 --> 01:56:13.739 align:start position:0%
figure out everything we think we want
 
01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
to fund
 
01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
and then figure out all right so just
 
01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
that we want to fund this yes yes and we
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
can eliminate the other lines as
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
indicated by the Community College yeah
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
that would be or not 54 and 53. no
 
01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
further consideration this year this
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist anywhere except on this
 
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
so do we need a motion or are we just
 
01:56:40.669 --> 01:56:40.679 align:start position:0%
going to hold on hold on is good so I
 
01:56:42.350 --> 01:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
think we had consensus on Civics
 
01:56:44.689 --> 01:56:44.699 align:start position:0%
textbook 2 million out expanding
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce credential in one million a
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
year I'll make that change and I'll
 
01:56:51.169 --> 01:56:51.179 align:start position:0%
update the sheets accordingly I'll
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
remove the solar product projects in the
 
01:56:55.729 --> 01:56:55.739 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance and I.T and update
 
01:56:57.890 --> 01:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
the amounts in the promise program lines
 
01:56:59.930 --> 01:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
the credit card fees still pending
 
01:57:08.810 --> 01:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
credit card fees yes well I I think I
 
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
think we're good with that I think
 
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
everyone's okay with the credit card
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
fees adding that money there uh
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
I thought we raised all our hands on
 
01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
this yeah I think we did that one number
 
01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:22.189 align:start position:0%
this yeah I think we did that one number
18.

01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
18.
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
so flipping over to page four I think
 
01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
the one that you maybe also want to
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
consider up or down at this point just
 
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
got to decide is the math learning
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
makes a 200 000 appropriation to the
 
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
community college system for that
 
01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:52.430 align:start position:0%
community college system for that
program

01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
if I may if you remember this is a
 
01:57:55.729 --> 01:57:55.739 align:start position:0%
program that we used to have previously
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know if Shannon wants to talk at
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
all about the um
 
01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
is that okay
 
01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
Shannon Reed with the community college
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
system thank you the math learning
 
01:58:14.089 --> 01:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
communities program is a partnership
 
01:58:16.609 --> 01:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
between the community colleges and high
 
01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
schools that opt in and it is aimed at
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
increasing the math preparedness the
 
01:58:21.649 --> 01:58:21.659 align:start position:0%
college level math preparedness of high
 
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
school students which is perennially an
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
issue particularly with students who
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
want to go into any type of technical
 
01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
field they need they need math
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
competency so we work with the high
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
schools to develop a curriculum that is
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
delivered in the high school the first
 
01:58:37.729 --> 01:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
it essentially creates two courses the
 
01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
first is a kind of a high school
 
01:58:43.609 --> 01:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
excuse me high school level
 
01:58:46.129 --> 01:58:46.139 align:start position:0%
um Math course which focuses on
 
01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
competency students will need for the
 
01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:50.099 align:start position:0%
next course which is a the Gateway Math
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
course for for college credit so
 
01:58:55.970 --> 01:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
students can finish those two courses
 
01:58:58.129 --> 01:58:58.139 align:start position:0%
and we know that they have the
 
01:58:58.139 --> 01:58:59.570 align:start position:0%
and we know that they have the
competencies

01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
competencies
 
01:59:01.370 --> 01:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
um to succeed and and to have passed
 
01:59:03.530 --> 01:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
that first level of college math
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to speak to you know
 
01:59:10.370 --> 01:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
support this because
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
you know my kid who's currently working
 
01:59:15.169 --> 01:59:15.179 align:start position:0%
for a biotech in Boston did you know
 
01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
very well in math in the high school and
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
yet her first year in uh translator was
 
01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
a bit of an adjustment to those smart
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
courses so anything that helps bridge
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
that Gap because you know I know that
 
01:59:29.209 --> 01:59:29.219 align:start position:0%
Windham works really hard and she was
 
01:59:30.770 --> 01:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
doing really well there but anything
 
01:59:33.410 --> 01:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
that would raise that level for the kids
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
who Wanna Go a bit further would help
 
01:59:37.850 --> 01:59:37.860 align:start position:0%
them transition more successfully into
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
the college system and again those are
 
01:59:42.290 --> 01:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
the kind of places where
 
01:59:45.050 --> 01:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
I think a few dollars can make a very
 
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
big difference so to me those are the
 
01:59:49.070 --> 01:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
kind of Investments we should favor over
 
01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
other types of projects
 
01:59:53.530 --> 01:59:53.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
I had a note from a parent that a
 
01:59:59.390 --> 01:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
daughter wanted to was getting all A's
 
02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
in school and and went to Boston
 
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
University wanting to go into pre-med
 
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
and she couldn't because she was taking
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
remedial math and English and so why do
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
we need all this remedial math we hear
 
02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
so much about in all the colleges
 
02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:15.589 align:start position:0%
so much about in all the colleges
because

02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
the high schools aren't teaching math
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
right so this is a Cooperative effort to
 
02:00:23.570 --> 02:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
try to reduce that the lady ended up not
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
even getting into pre-med because she'd
 
02:00:27.649 --> 02:00:27.659 align:start position:0%
almost lost a semester with the remedial
 
02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
stuff she had to do had to go to another
 
02:00:34.010 --> 02:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
another major so it is important that if
 
02:00:35.570 --> 02:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
they come out of high school especially
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
honors and and on and scholar and you
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
know the top list and then they can't do
 
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:49.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
can I speak I was to sponsor that bill
 
02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:53.390 align:start position:0%
can I speak I was to sponsor that bill
okay

02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:58.609 --> 02:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
and we've been working over the years
 
02:01:01.370 --> 02:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
with Beth Dorian over at the community
 
02:01:05.570 --> 02:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
college system in HTI and we had 38 high
 
02:01:07.010 --> 02:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
schools that have participated in this
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
program in the past and this program for
 
02:01:10.970 --> 02:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars we're
 
02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
getting the materials not the textbooks
 
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
aren't textbooks but we're getting the
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
teaching materials provided by the
 
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
community college system we're getting
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh those that are helping us from the
 
02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
community college system we have
 
02:01:25.010 --> 02:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
workshops established during the summer
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
months down at nhti this provides some
 
02:01:29.570 --> 02:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
travel for the teachers come down we're
 
02:01:31.850 --> 02:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
having teachers teaching teachers and
 
02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
for those 38 schools and this is also
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
chapter law already in statute this is
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
there we just have not funded it seeing
 
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
that the grant that the community
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
college system received ran out and now
 
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent in us to try to continue
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
that but the students that are now
 
02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
coming out after math foundations in the
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
11th grade and quantitative math in the
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
12th grade have proven to need less
 
02:01:59.330 --> 02:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
remediation because now we are providing
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
instruction after we give the accuplacer
 
02:02:02.639 --> 02:02:03.410 align:start position:0%
instruction after we give the accuplacer
test

02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
test
 
02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
the Next Generation accuplacer test at
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
the end of the 10th grade we determine
 
02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
by working with counselors by the parent
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
with the parent Administration in the
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
school and the Community College if this
 
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
youngster needs to go another track
 
02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
because they really don't have those
 
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
foundational skills we get that and we
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
see that kids are coming out of this
 
02:02:22.729 --> 02:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
program much better prepared and we're
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
no longer seeing for those that are
 
02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
involved in this that 60 percent rate of
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
students that go on to Community College
 
02:02:31.390 --> 02:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
that represent Weiler just mentioned
 
02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
that need some kind we don't call it
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
Remediation in the community college
 
02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
system anymore they're they're working
 
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
within the class uh trying to help them
 
02:02:42.649 --> 02:02:42.659 align:start position:0%
out but we no longer have that 50
 
02:02:45.050 --> 02:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
percent of that 60 percent that never
 
02:02:47.209 --> 02:02:47.219 align:start position:0%
get a degree because they spend all this
 
02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
money and time but they still couldn't
 
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
hack it we need to have this program at
 
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
the secondary level it's proven
 
02:02:55.970 --> 02:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
effective and
 
02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:56.629 align:start position:0%
effective and
um

02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
we're getting more than a bang for the
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
buck and the community college system is
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
really helping us carry that burden okay
 
02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so moved Okay so
 
02:03:08.689 --> 02:03:08.699 align:start position:0%
I think we're all in favor of this item
 
02:03:11.209 --> 02:03:11.219 align:start position:0%
all right we'll find it somewhere
 
02:03:16.250 --> 02:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:18.609 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:03:18.609 --> 02:03:18.619 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
building age so we can fund all the rest
 
02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair we haven't crossed that bridge
 
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.629 align:start position:0%
Mr chair we haven't crossed that bridge
yet

02:03:34.629 --> 02:03:34.639 align:start position:0%
yet
 
02:03:38.689 --> 02:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
yes while I'm not saying that the amount
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
is appropriate is there any interest in
 
02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
talking about HB 540 on the adequacy
 
02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
grant special education amount increase
 
02:03:49.550 --> 02:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
I think that's what we're going to
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
consider Mickey's going to do some more
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
okay so that's part of what we're you
 
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
know Meek is working on it's in regards
 
02:03:59.390 --> 02:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
to that pill or item or what not I don't
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think we've decided we're doing
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
anything with special education and
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
since 540 that's why I'm asking I mean I
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
my takeaway is 529 and 540 will just
 
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
stay retained and that doesn't sound
 
02:04:13.490 --> 02:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
like either of those bills components
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
will be incorporated into your final
 
02:04:17.089 --> 02:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
proposal thread funding that's that's
 
02:04:19.729 --> 02:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
that's my where I'm at right now if I
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
may ask a question yeah so
 
02:04:25.550 --> 02:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
those bills that are retained
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
once the deadline budget for the budget
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
buses and we adopt the budget and it's
 
02:04:30.239 --> 02:04:31.370 align:start position:0%
buses and we adopt the budget and it's
done

02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:04:34.609 --> 02:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
are we what is our window to do anything
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
with them I'm just I've never been
 
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
through this cycle so we kind of convene
 
02:04:42.169 --> 02:04:42.179 align:start position:0%
as a committee in the fall okay and look
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
at all the retained bills and decide
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
does this need to have legislation for
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
next year okay so then we can draft
 
02:04:51.290 --> 02:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
legislation that's be introduced in the
 
02:04:52.729 --> 02:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
following year because I would like to
 
02:04:55.250 --> 02:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
make sure that at least you know 529 and
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
even 540 I think they are very much
 
02:05:01.490 --> 02:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
useful we may not have the time and the
 
02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
resources right now but I just want to
 
02:05:06.530 --> 02:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
see them continue to progress you know
 
02:05:09.410 --> 02:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's that's up to us understood thank
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
you so there is still time to work on
 
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
them yes thank you
 
02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:16.669 align:start position:0%
them yes thank you
very

02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:05:20.330 --> 02:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
with the risk of probably jumping off a
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
cliff here
 
02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:23.219 align:start position:0%
um do we want to talk about building air
 
02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
we I know the hour is getting late but
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
um in the um Department of Ed's
 
02:05:33.250 --> 02:05:33.260 align:start position:0%
um summary they have
 
02:05:39.229 --> 02:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
43.1 and 43.4 uh for 24 and 25 listed in
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
their budget I was hoping that we could
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
use add to that line so that we could
 
02:05:48.530 --> 02:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
fund at least conquered and Litchfield
 
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
so there'd be additional project I don't
 
02:05:53.770 --> 02:05:53.780 align:start position:0%
know exactly how much that would be more
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
but I would put that out there for
 
02:06:01.970 --> 02:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:03.709 --> 02:06:03.719 align:start position:0%
I think the
 
02:06:05.450 --> 02:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
School building Aid is one of our
 
02:06:07.550 --> 02:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
biggest items that is still open right
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
now in the representative whole proposal
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
would completely change the school
 
02:06:13.070 --> 02:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
building aid program effectively
 
02:06:16.209 --> 02:06:16.219 align:start position:0%
repealing it so representative Heath's
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
discussion topic here is directly
 
02:06:20.330 --> 02:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
related to what direction you go with
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
that Amendment so once that amendment's
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
cleaned up and brought back to this
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee Maybe by this afternoon that's
 
02:06:27.649 --> 02:06:27.659 align:start position:0%
that's something you'll have to debate
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
and decide but we can well probably not
 
02:06:32.770 --> 02:06:32.780 align:start position:0%
prepare to do that right now but
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
but the governor's budget had
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
has building Aid in it the governor's
 
02:06:42.109 --> 02:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
budget includes the tail and and Debt
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
Service payments as well as about 48
 
02:06:45.709 --> 02:06:45.719 align:start position:0%
million dollars for new school building
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
Aid projects this biennium and then if
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
you recall he set aside 75 million
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
dollars for school building aiding
 
02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
future items this committee has already
 
02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
decided not to do the 75 million we've
 
02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
already reduced that but the remaining
 
02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh 48 million for new projects this by
 
02:07:02.209 --> 02:07:02.219 align:start position:0%
any name is still I think that covers
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
what you were trying what you were
 
02:07:06.410 --> 02:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
saying uh it does not cover Litchfield
 
02:07:09.410 --> 02:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
and Concord one no but if they're given
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
that much money that's really up to the
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and those
 
02:07:15.290 --> 02:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
communities to figure out uh well we
 
02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:16.739 align:start position:0%
heard from the Department it's a rank
 
02:07:20.450 --> 02:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
list right so right all I'm saying is
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
they they've been playing with
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
approximately 25 million dollars now
 
02:07:30.169 --> 02:07:30.179 align:start position:0%
they have 43 million dollars so 40 48
 
02:07:32.450 --> 02:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
for the biennium for new projects oh for
 
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
the buy any yeah so that still
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 25 million yep and I think
 
02:07:38.810 --> 02:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
that funds the first three for the for
 
02:07:40.129 --> 02:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
these two years it's estimated that
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
would fund the first three projects and
 
02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
the four and five are conquered
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
Litchfield those are not covered by the
 
02:07:48.109 --> 02:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
governor's budget okay
 
02:07:50.089 --> 02:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
but again
 
02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
that in representative Hull's Amendment
 
02:07:54.649 --> 02:07:54.659 align:start position:0%
and this completely conflicts so you
 
02:07:56.330 --> 02:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do both you'd have to decide
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
which direction you're going to go just
 
02:08:01.250 --> 02:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
a very quick note at least this year the
 
02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
number two project warrant article
 
02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:04.189 align:start position:0%
number two project warrant article
failed

02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
failed
 
02:08:08.570 --> 02:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
whoever was number two
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
one and three are good to go but two did
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
not make it this year
 
02:08:18.770 --> 02:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
out of the priority list the vote is
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
ready to go no I know I'm sure Concord
 
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
is ready to go that's number four right
 
02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
I was talking about the number the top
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
three that Mickey was referring
 
02:08:30.589 --> 02:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
there's also the CTE which the normally
 
02:08:33.050 --> 02:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
goes in the public works but they've
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
they've filled up they could take care
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
of one CTE but not both we've got the
 
02:08:39.229 --> 02:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
other one funded in Surplus and we
 
02:08:40.970 --> 02:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
covered the other one yes I said under
 
02:08:42.350 --> 02:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
building eight
 
02:08:46.490 --> 02:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
no it's it's under Surplus for 23.
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
just like to take an opportunity Rick
 
02:08:54.890 --> 02:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
lad he wrote again to talk to number two
 
02:08:57.890 --> 02:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
which uh I don't want you to operate on
 
02:08:57.900 --> 02:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
which uh I don't want you to operate on
misinformation

02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
02:09:02.810 --> 02:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
um yes that they that concern is up and
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
Colebrook however
 
02:09:07.070 --> 02:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
the superintendent Taylor did come down
 
02:09:08.930 --> 02:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
when we're discussing the past Friday
 
02:09:12.589 --> 02:09:12.599 align:start position:0%
School building Aid and the house
 
02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
education committee since has modified
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
legislation when we're funding uh and
 
02:09:19.550 --> 02:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
let's say the district's allocated
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
in-state support three million dollars
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
and and protect and I'll just say that
 
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
number just for Colebrook for example
 
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
and the folks up in Coburg have now gone
 
02:09:36.649 --> 02:09:36.659 align:start position:0%
to other ways of attaining that money
 
02:09:39.649 --> 02:09:39.659 align:start position:0%
and either be through a charitable trust
 
02:09:42.729 --> 02:09:42.739 align:start position:0%
a gift or insurance
 
02:09:46.729 --> 02:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
right now if we use monies like that to
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
in a project we offset the money which
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
is received by them may we take that you
 
02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
know let's say two million dollars out
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
and they receive one million dollars for
 
02:09:55.850 --> 02:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
the project
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
what they've been able to do they've
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
gone to benefactors up there and they
 
02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
have received in donations and Gifts in
 
02:10:05.450 --> 02:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
excess of two million dollars now so
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
that they want to be able to apply that
 
02:10:10.490 --> 02:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
to you know the to the project and not
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
lose it uh um as a result of uh it the
 
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
way the legislation is presently written
 
02:10:19.370 --> 02:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
we've modified that to take out yes if
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
you receive a Federal Grant or a state
 
02:10:24.649 --> 02:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
grant that will come out of what we
 
02:10:26.750 --> 02:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
um additional Grant additional federal
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
dollars that will come out of your state
 
02:10:32.570 --> 02:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
school building Aid amount however if
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
you now receive a charitable trust or a
 
02:10:38.930 --> 02:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
gift of some kind that will not and so
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's what they've done and the
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
community is really working hard to find
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
the money through that other alternative
 
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
fashion and then and they're just about
 
02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:50.870 align:start position:0%
fashion and then and they're just about
there

02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
what about fish and game what not
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
the additional support for fish and game
 
02:11:00.169 --> 02:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
so there's three general fund items
 
02:11:02.209 --> 02:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
relative to fish and game on page three
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
you'll see those uh starting on line 29.
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
and then I also have the fish and game
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
fun Surplus statement on page eight of
 
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
your packet as it stands right now at
 
02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
the end of the biennium the fish and
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
game fund has on a gap adjusted basis
 
02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
four and a half million dollars of a
 
02:11:22.070 --> 02:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
surplus so they're not going into the
 
02:11:24.649 --> 02:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
red you'll you will see that that fund
 
02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
balance does decline each year because
 
02:11:28.250 --> 02:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
they are running a deficit essentially
 
02:11:30.169 --> 02:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
from revenues and spending
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
they've brought forward three requests
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
for General funds
 
02:11:37.550 --> 02:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
one is switching the funding for or I'll
 
02:11:39.890 --> 02:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
start at the first one online 29. one
 
02:11:42.530 --> 02:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
was to add a
 
02:11:45.649 --> 02:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
two positions for six months at the end
 
02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
of the biennium in general funds in 18
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
months of arpa money so that for that
 
02:11:51.649 --> 02:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
grants available but only for the first
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the biennium and
 
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
there'd be 193 dollars 193 000 of
 
02:11:58.970 --> 02:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
General funds for fiscal 25. the next
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
request was Colonel Jordan had talked
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
about just switching the funding source
 
02:12:04.129 --> 02:12:04.139 align:start position:0%
for two correctional officers from Fish
 
02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
and Game funds to General funds this
 
02:12:08.089 --> 02:12:08.099 align:start position:0%
would be a general fund increase and
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
take a little bit of pressure off the
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
fish and game fund and then lastly these
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
numbers here on the general fund
 
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
transfer to The Fish and Game fund tie
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
to the amount of the pay raise the 10
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
and 2 percent appropriation that is
 
02:12:22.129 --> 02:12:22.139 align:start position:0%
included in House Bill 2 the negotiated
 
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
pay raise increase the fish and game
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
fund is the fishing and department is
 
02:12:28.189 --> 02:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
essentially asking for the general fund
 
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
to cover those costs for two years which
 
02:12:32.930 --> 02:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
I can't recall that happening before and
 
02:12:35.089 --> 02:12:35.099 align:start position:0%
and uh other funded agency situation
 
02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
that the general fund would pay for
 
02:12:38.209 --> 02:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
their any portion of their personnel
 
02:12:38.219 --> 02:12:39.589 align:start position:0%
their any portion of their personnel
costs

02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:12:41.390 --> 02:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner told me the governor
 
02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
promised that that's where this money
 
02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
would come from because he said that 10
 
02:12:46.729 --> 02:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
pay raise he didn't have in his budget
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
the governor said we'll put it in
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
general funds is it already in the
 
02:12:50.159 --> 02:12:51.050 align:start position:0%
general funds is it already in the
budget

02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:12:53.569 --> 02:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
so the fish and game Surplus that has a
 
02:12:54.890 --> 02:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
four and a half million dollar ending
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
balance assumes it is paying for this
 
02:12:59.209 --> 02:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
pay raise with Fish and Game funds
 
02:13:01.970 --> 02:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
already which it's not this is the only
 
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
time we'll see the general fund cover of
 
02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:04.970 align:start position:0%
time we'll see the general fund cover of
that

02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:06.649 --> 02:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
it's just a request at this point the
 
02:13:09.050 --> 02:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
governor did not put General funds in
 
02:13:11.209 --> 02:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
there for the pay raise if they had
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
discussions about doing so it never
 
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
actually came in the budget that was
 
02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
presented to this committee but they're
 
02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:17.950 align:start position:0%
presented to this committee but they're
fun

02:13:17.950 --> 02:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
fun
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
if you look on page eight
 
02:13:24.770 --> 02:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
line 11.
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
it is accounted for in the fish and game
 
02:13:28.970 --> 02:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
fund okay so the four and a half million
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
dollar balance you see at the end
 
02:13:32.830 --> 02:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
already covers the 10 and 2.
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
just to make a quick point though we are
 
02:13:37.609 --> 02:13:37.619 align:start position:0%
spending down the balance of this fund
 
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
and since we are spending it at a faster
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
rate than we put any money into it by
 
02:13:45.770 --> 02:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
now you can safely assume that anything
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
we found from that fund will sooner or
 
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
later become a general fund expense at
 
02:13:51.290 --> 02:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
this rate
 
02:13:54.649 --> 02:13:54.659 align:start position:0%
because you know I'm just saying that at
 
02:13:56.689 --> 02:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
this point the distinction is temporary
 
02:14:01.490 --> 02:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:03.770 --> 02:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
all depends how many fishing licenses
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
they sell well the fish and game is
 
02:14:08.569 --> 02:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
we've always put money in fishing game I
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
mean that covet change that a little bit
 
02:14:13.250 --> 02:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
yeah because they're doing search and
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
rescue now too and that's more that's
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
not even uh it's not even close I can't
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:21.119 --> 02:14:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
we have to find the money to give them
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
the money
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
yeah just a minute that can go on our
 
02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
we'd like to do this list but we don't
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
know if we've got the money to do it
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
so the hike safe isn't covered uh search
 
02:14:38.330 --> 02:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
and rescue the hike safe is covering
 
02:14:39.709 --> 02:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
search and rescue so the search and
 
02:14:41.930 --> 02:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
rescue fund is is fine
 
02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
this is the fish and game fund
 
02:14:47.810 --> 02:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
this is just an effort to switch more of
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
their cos onto the general fund versus
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
The Fish and Game fund
 
02:14:54.770 --> 02:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
with the under the uh
 
02:14:56.930 --> 02:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
argument that they do work that's not
 
02:14:58.490 --> 02:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
always directly related to the hunting
 
02:15:00.169 --> 02:15:00.179 align:start position:0%
and fishing licenses that pay for the
 
02:15:01.850 --> 02:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
fish and game funds so General fundsport
 
02:15:03.530 --> 02:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
there is already two and a half million
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
dollars in this budget of General funds
 
02:15:07.010 --> 02:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
in there covering correction officers
 
02:15:09.169 --> 02:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan's request was to expand
 
02:15:12.169 --> 02:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
foreign we'll have to see if Finance has
 
02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:19.970 --> 02:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
with that let's break for lunch and
 
02:15:22.010 --> 02:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
we'll see you at one o'clock and we'll
 
02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
recess Mr chair division two recess and
 
02:15:27.229 --> 02:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
then after full committee you can decide
 
02:15:28.370 --> 02:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
if you want to come back in here and
 
02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
I'll have stuff for us so we'll recess
 
02:15:35.629 --> 02:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
but no we've got to go to the big big
 
02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
room for one yeah
 
02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
we'll come back here after that if
 
02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.890 --> 02:15:47.900 align:start position:0%
all depends on how fast that goes yeah
 
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
it could take one hour it could take
 
02:15:54.410 --> 02:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:25.788 --> 05:10:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay we'll come out of recess
 
05:10:32.930 --> 05:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
and we have a new handout for Mickey
 
05:10:34.610 --> 05:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
so if you like to
 
05:10:37.550 --> 05:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
walk us through it that would be great
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh sure so we're up to the scenarios
 
05:10:42.170 --> 05:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
number 10 11 and 12. so these are the
 
05:10:44.690 --> 05:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
three that we discussed this morning
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
so the first being essentially the
 
05:10:49.430 --> 05:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget with an
 
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
additional approximate 20 million
 
05:10:53.090 --> 05:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
dollars per year added to the
 
05:10:55.070 --> 05:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant so you can see
 
05:10:56.570 --> 05:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
that would put the extraordinary needs
 
05:10:59.208 --> 05:10:59.218 align:start position:0%
Grant up to 37.50 is that on the cover
 
05:11:03.170 --> 05:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
page here right proposal 11 is bringing
 
05:11:05.448 --> 05:11:05.458 align:start position:0%
the base Aid down to 4500 the frame
 
05:11:08.330 --> 05:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
reduced down to 23.80 using that money
 
05:11:11.150 --> 05:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
would increase the maximum grant for
 
05:11:13.970 --> 05:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
Extraordinary needs to 67.50 and then
 
05:11:15.788 --> 05:11:15.798 align:start position:0%
proposal 12
 
05:11:18.530 --> 05:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
4423 20 for base and free and reduce
 
05:11:21.410 --> 05:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
respectively would give you enough to
 
05:11:23.330 --> 05:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
fund eight thousand dollars per
 
05:11:25.550 --> 05:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
extraordinary need Grant under the
 
05:11:27.650 --> 05:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
additional 20 million per year so 11 and
 
05:11:29.690 --> 05:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
12 are the old
 
05:11:31.730 --> 05:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
three and four
 
05:11:34.670 --> 05:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
I don't remember yes the old three and
 
05:11:36.410 --> 05:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
four plus twenty mil a year right yeah
 
05:11:36.420 --> 05:11:39.050 align:start position:0%
four plus twenty mil a year right yeah
okay

05:11:39.050 --> 05:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:41.690 --> 05:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
comment yes
 
05:11:44.270 --> 05:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chad
 
05:11:44.280 --> 05:11:45.170 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chad
um

05:11:45.170 --> 05:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:47.810 --> 05:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
I have I have a question on the
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
procedure here so that
 
05:11:52.788 --> 05:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
um we could keep
 
05:11:55.788 --> 05:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
no no no
 
05:11:58.850 --> 05:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
on the education trust fund
 
05:12:00.708 --> 05:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
um the Surplus we have
 
05:12:04.610 --> 05:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
on page six is 96 million is that
 
05:12:04.620 --> 05:12:05.810 align:start position:0%
on page six is 96 million is that
correct

05:12:05.810 --> 05:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:12:09.050 --> 05:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
correct and um so we can use the we can
 
05:12:12.170 --> 05:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
we can use that 96 million and put some
 
05:12:13.250 --> 05:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
of it into
 
05:12:13.260 --> 05:12:14.990 align:start position:0%
of it into
um

05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:18.050 --> 05:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs account
 
05:12:22.430 --> 05:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
and and still leave the 4700 in the
 
05:12:22.440 --> 05:12:23.868 align:start position:0%
and and still leave the 4700 in the
original

05:12:23.868 --> 05:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
original
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
in the original
 
05:12:25.320 --> 05:12:27.350 align:start position:0%
in the original
um base

05:12:27.350 --> 05:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
um base
 
05:12:30.470 --> 05:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
is is that is that workable
 
05:12:32.030 --> 05:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
for those two things so that's
 
05:12:34.730 --> 05:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
essentially proposal 10 keeping forty
 
05:12:36.350 --> 05:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
seven hundred twenty five hundred as the
 
05:12:38.570 --> 05:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
governor recommended but increasing the
 
05:12:40.970 --> 05:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs up to 37.50 and
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
spending an additional 40 million over
 
05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
the biennium yes where's the 37.50 the
 
05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
extraordinary Grant okay and what is the
 
05:12:51.670 --> 05:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's 20 million per year so 40 million
 
05:12:56.208 --> 05:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
over the biennium more than the
 
05:12:58.070 --> 05:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
governor's budget so that would come out
 
05:13:01.270 --> 05:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
of this Surplus this is conceivably yes
 
05:13:04.310 --> 05:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
yes barring no other changes so that's
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
where you are right now with changes to
 
05:13:06.000 --> 05:13:07.368 align:start position:0%
where you are right now with changes to
date

05:13:07.368 --> 05:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
date
 
05:13:10.788 --> 05:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
so proposal 10 would increase the
 
05:13:12.350 --> 05:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy adequate education
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
Appropriations by about 40 million over
 
05:13:17.030 --> 05:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
the biennium so that 96 would be about
 
05:13:17.040 --> 05:13:21.110 align:start position:0%
the biennium so that 96 would be about
56.

05:13:21.110 --> 05:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
well I mean that sounds like something
 
05:13:28.010 --> 05:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
that would meet the the needs of of the
 
05:13:30.770 --> 05:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
requirements that people were asking for
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
as far as increasing the
 
05:13:33.360 --> 05:13:34.190 align:start position:0%
as far as increasing the
um

05:13:34.190 --> 05:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:36.590 --> 05:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side
 
05:13:39.170 --> 05:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
um increasing the extraordinary needs
 
05:13:39.180 --> 05:13:40.310 align:start position:0%
um increasing the extraordinary needs
line

05:13:40.310 --> 05:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
while still leaving the
 
05:13:44.690 --> 05:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
while still leaving what most people are
 
05:13:49.368 --> 05:13:49.378 align:start position:0%
going to see that the Baseline where at
 
05:13:52.010 --> 05:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
and you can see on the the next page
 
05:13:58.010 --> 05:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
the town by town so proposal number 10
 
05:14:00.650 --> 05:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
is that that scenario there
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
so you see there is some more targeted
 
05:14:04.550 --> 05:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
Aid to certain communities that wouldn't
 
05:14:06.650 --> 05:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
get it under the governor's recommended
 
05:14:09.530 --> 05:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
other towns get a little bit less
 
05:14:11.150 --> 05:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
they were not ones dependent on
 
05:14:14.690 --> 05:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs and spends about 40
 
05:14:17.390 --> 05:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
million over the biennium war
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
which is what looking at proposal 11 on
 
05:14:22.970 --> 05:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
that 10. next page is that way numbers
 
05:14:25.850 --> 05:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:28.128 --> 05:14:28.138 align:start position:0%
I think if you look at Concord
 
05:14:29.868 --> 05:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
you'll see where that extraordinary age
 
05:14:36.948 --> 05:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
huh I know yeah
 
05:14:43.850 --> 05:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
not even have my lighter fluid for tar
 
05:14:43.860 --> 05:14:49.010 align:start position:0%
not even have my lighter fluid for tar
removal

05:14:49.010 --> 05:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:50.868 --> 05:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
are you happy with that
 
05:15:08.270 --> 05:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:11.448 --> 05:15:11.458 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I'm asking all those
 
05:15:13.430 --> 05:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
questions and I and I don't
 
05:15:15.530 --> 05:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything under proposal 11
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
for Conway
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
it was it wasn't a good idea
 
05:15:21.708 --> 05:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
well I mean it's you're still getting
 
05:15:24.410 --> 05:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
the same positions
 
05:15:27.128 --> 05:15:27.138 align:start position:0%
well you're you're good no no
 
05:15:29.270 --> 05:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
stabilization's gone in all these
 
05:15:31.970 --> 05:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
proposals to hold harmless
 
05:15:33.770 --> 05:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
old harmless
 
05:15:35.090 --> 05:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
on a different
 
05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
like decline schedule right
 
05:15:39.890 --> 05:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
so even even proposal 10
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
is about a 59 million dollar hold
 
05:15:44.570 --> 05:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
harmless has to still be in play and
 
05:15:47.030 --> 05:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative I did Total the number of
 
05:15:49.190 --> 05:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
towns that are well I didn't I don't
 
05:15:51.530 --> 05:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
think I did it for these but for that
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
first block of scenarios that we did it
 
05:15:56.090 --> 05:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
was I don't think any of the scenarios
 
05:15:59.570 --> 05:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
Eclipse 100 towns as far as ones they
 
05:16:02.330 --> 05:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
would get more money so essentially it
 
05:16:04.010 --> 05:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
was in the 90s like let me see I can
 
05:16:06.368 --> 05:16:06.378 align:start position:0%
pull it up
 
05:16:09.830 --> 05:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
see I'll be happy to just write that
 
05:16:27.470 --> 05:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:29.810 --> 05:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
so in
 
05:16:31.730 --> 05:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
let me see
 
05:16:35.990 --> 05:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
well there's 103 towns under proposal 10
 
05:16:37.368 --> 05:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
would get more money than under current
 
05:16:40.208 --> 05:16:40.218 align:start position:0%
law so all of those figures you see
 
05:16:43.990 --> 05:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
103 and then I guess doing math
 
05:16:48.350 --> 05:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
242 or 142 are zeros
 
05:16:51.410 --> 05:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
and I think we're two towns are zero no
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
change yeah and do you have those
 
05:16:56.208 --> 05:16:56.218 align:start position:0%
numbers of tones for proposals three to
 
05:16:56.218 --> 05:17:05.930 align:start position:0%
numbers of tones for proposals three to
nine

05:17:05.930 --> 05:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:05.940 --> 05:17:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:17:10.070 --> 05:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm really fine getting that answer
 
05:17:14.330 --> 05:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning too because I don't
 
05:17:16.250 --> 05:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
think that we'll be making this decision
 
05:17:18.770 --> 05:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
in the next 45 minutes
 
05:17:21.650 --> 05:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
but it's just a number that I would like
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
to have when evaluating all these
 
05:17:25.868 --> 05:17:25.878 align:start position:0%
proposals because of
 
05:17:28.368 --> 05:17:28.378 align:start position:0%
non-policy but political considerations
 
05:17:38.030 --> 05:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:43.550 --> 05:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:48.830 --> 05:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
speak to the government
 
05:17:59.270 --> 05:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:01.730 --> 05:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
and then so then it starts at 98 at
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
proposal three
 
05:18:06.110 --> 05:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
then 94 91
 
05:18:10.550 --> 05:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
87 81 79
 
05:18:16.610 --> 05:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
74 and then proposal 9 is 73.
 
05:18:19.128 --> 05:18:19.138 align:start position:0%
and the reason you see that taper is
 
05:18:19.138 --> 05:18:20.510 align:start position:0%
and the reason you see that taper is
as

05:18:20.510 --> 05:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
as the the
 
05:18:24.948 --> 05:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
as the left goes up and you have more
 
05:18:26.690 --> 05:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
hold harmless on the right is what
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
happens or at left goes down rather we
 
05:18:34.910 --> 05:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:36.770 --> 05:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
05:18:38.690 --> 05:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Mickey
 
05:18:40.670 --> 05:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
um in turn I just want to ask some
 
05:18:44.208 --> 05:18:44.218 align:start position:0%
questions about Conway so Conway
 
05:18:46.490 --> 05:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
um 11 and 12 they don't see any funding
 
05:18:53.150 --> 05:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
now my question is
 
05:18:56.750 --> 05:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
North Conway and Conway are are pretty
 
05:19:00.708 --> 05:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
affluent towns but those who live there
 
05:19:03.890 --> 05:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
and do the day-to-day work
 
05:19:03.900 --> 05:19:05.270 align:start position:0%
and do the day-to-day work
um

05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you have a high fnr
 
05:19:16.128 --> 05:19:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:18.170 --> 05:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
and I was just wondering why they there
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
05:19:22.190 --> 05:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
how that balanced out if they have a
 
05:19:27.890 --> 05:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:31.610 --> 05:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
so they they have a decent F and r
 
05:19:33.770 --> 05:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
so as you increase
 
05:19:36.350 --> 05:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
bass and the fnr per pupil they they get
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
somebody that's why under the governors
 
05:19:39.890 --> 05:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
they see an increase
 
05:19:39.900 --> 05:19:42.530 align:start position:0%
they see an increase
however

05:19:42.530 --> 05:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
they are not qualified for fiscal
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid and they do have
 
05:19:49.730 --> 05:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
a stabilization Grant so when you pull
 
05:19:52.128 --> 05:19:52.138 align:start position:0%
the stabilization Grant away
 
05:19:54.650 --> 05:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
and Target it with extraordinary needs
 
05:19:56.090 --> 05:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
they don't get the extraordinary needs
 
05:19:58.730 --> 05:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
but they lose the stabilization Grant
 
05:20:01.070 --> 05:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
but they are close on stabilization that
 
05:20:02.090 --> 05:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
when the
 
05:20:04.610 --> 05:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
base and fnr is at the governor's levels
 
05:20:06.110 --> 05:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
they would see an increase but when you
 
05:20:07.550 --> 05:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
start tapering down the governors they
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't see an increase and
 
05:20:11.150 --> 05:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of towns that would fall
 
05:20:12.490 --> 05:20:12.500 align:start position:0%
on that boat there's there's probably
 
05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
close to a half a dozen different
 
05:20:16.430 --> 05:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
scenarios that could happen you know if
 
05:20:18.590 --> 05:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
you put each other towns into certain
 
05:20:21.288 --> 05:20:21.298 align:start position:0%
categories uh and that that's Conway's
 
05:20:22.610 --> 05:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
Story and there's probably other towns
 
05:20:22.620 --> 05:20:24.230 align:start position:0%
Story and there's probably other towns
similar

05:20:24.230 --> 05:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
similar
 
05:20:28.910 --> 05:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
Berlin is in the same position that it
 
05:20:32.400 --> 05:20:34.368 align:start position:0%
Berlin is in the same position that it
gets

05:20:34.368 --> 05:20:34.378 align:start position:0%
gets
 
05:20:37.128 --> 05:20:37.138 align:start position:0%
it looks like nothing I think is it
 
05:20:39.050 --> 05:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
correct to say that the removal of the
 
05:20:40.970 --> 05:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant is really what
 
05:20:43.610 --> 05:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
Berlin is going to feel the most
 
05:20:45.288 --> 05:20:45.298 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we do on the right
 
05:20:46.610 --> 05:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
side of the equation
 
05:20:49.550 --> 05:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely so Berlin stabilization Grant
 
05:20:51.470 --> 05:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
like is more than half of their total
 
05:20:54.110 --> 05:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
adequacy plus swept so when you take
 
05:20:56.448 --> 05:20:56.458 align:start position:0%
that away they're replacing it with a
 
05:20:59.330 --> 05:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh equalized valuation per
 
05:21:01.550 --> 05:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
pupil based extraordinary needs it does
 
05:21:03.530 --> 05:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
not come close to offsetting the loss of
 
05:21:05.690 --> 05:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
stabilization you'll see claremonts in
 
05:21:09.350 --> 05:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
the same boat as a similarly so if I may
 
05:21:12.410 --> 05:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
whoops so they have
 
05:21:16.490 --> 05:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
Berlin has a ton of State Property
 
05:21:19.730 --> 05:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
which they can't tax
 
05:21:22.910 --> 05:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
and then they have high F and R numbers
 
05:21:26.930 --> 05:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
and they still
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:32.810 --> 05:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
it's for Berlin you're talking yeah yeah
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
so their stabilization Grant is five and
 
05:21:37.368 --> 05:21:37.378 align:start position:0%
a half million dollars
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
their cost of an adequate education as
 
05:21:40.910 --> 05:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
calculated through on the left side of
 
05:21:42.708 --> 05:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
the point is less than that so their
 
05:21:44.570 --> 05:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
stabilization is more than half of like
 
05:21:48.050 --> 05:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
I said so they qualify but not remotely
 
05:21:49.970 --> 05:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
close to how much the stabilization is
 
05:21:52.190 --> 05:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so I can tell you
 
05:21:55.430 --> 05:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
for so scenario 12 would be out of the
 
05:21:56.570 --> 05:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
ones that we just did here with the
 
05:21:57.770 --> 05:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
additional money
 
05:21:59.510 --> 05:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
let me call that up and I'll tell you so
 
05:22:26.628 --> 05:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:28.850 --> 05:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
so under scenario 12
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's where our the fiscal capacity or
 
05:22:33.470 --> 05:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me the extraordinary needs is
 
05:22:35.628 --> 05:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
what eight eight thousand
 
05:22:38.090 --> 05:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
right and even with the infusion of the
 
05:22:40.010 --> 05:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
additional 20 million and lowering the
 
05:22:41.390 --> 05:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
left side of the formula to send that
 
05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
money targeted there's Statewide 118
 
05:22:46.670 --> 05:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars for Extraordinary needs
 
05:22:48.890 --> 05:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
3.5 is Berlin
 
05:22:50.510 --> 05:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
so if you're taking away a five and a
 
05:22:52.128 --> 05:22:52.138 align:start position:0%
half million dollar stabilization and
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
you're replacing it even with this most
 
05:22:55.610 --> 05:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
targeted Aid proposal it's still 2
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
million short of replacing so their
 
05:23:03.530 --> 05:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:08.030 --> 05:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
and even the proposal 12 is about 46.5
 
05:23:09.590 --> 05:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars Statewide of a hold
 
05:23:12.050 --> 05:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
harmless so Berlin is 2 million of that
 
05:23:14.090 --> 05:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
plus there's a bunch of other towns in
 
05:23:17.448 --> 05:23:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:17.458 --> 05:23:19.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:23:19.550 --> 05:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:23:22.610 --> 05:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
so scenario 12
 
05:23:27.770 --> 05:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:31.610 --> 05:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:36.288 --> 05:23:36.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:44.090 --> 05:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
from from the governors or from um yeah
 
05:23:45.890 --> 05:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
the governors yeah so the governor was
 
05:23:49.670 --> 05:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
47 and 2500 proposal 12s 44 and 23 20.
 
05:23:51.590 --> 05:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:23:51.600 --> 05:23:57.250 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
foreign

05:23:57.250 --> 05:23:57.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:00.650 --> 05:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
proposal 10 11 and 12 they all account
 
05:24:04.310 --> 05:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
for that extra 20 million over
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
for each year in the biennium for the
 
05:24:08.150 --> 05:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant that's also
 
05:24:11.030 --> 05:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
baked in right yeah okay yeah so if you
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
look at page two of this handout right
 
05:24:15.410 --> 05:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
along the top the state total so you'll
 
05:24:16.788 --> 05:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
see the governor recommended was about
 
05:24:18.830 --> 05:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
120 million over the biennium above
 
05:24:20.570 --> 05:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
current law these three proposals are
 
05:24:22.550 --> 05:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
closer to 160. so that's where the extra
 
05:24:42.770 --> 05:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:44.448 --> 05:24:44.458 align:start position:0%
but then we would have to change the
 
05:24:46.730 --> 05:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
language on there on the 50 percent
 
05:24:46.740 --> 05:24:49.010 align:start position:0%
language on there on the 50 percent
increase

05:24:49.010 --> 05:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
increase
 
05:24:52.430 --> 05:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah so as what's in House Bill 2 now
 
05:24:54.170 --> 05:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
the governor was keeping extraordinary
 
05:24:58.250 --> 05:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
needs at 650 so adding 50 to that each
 
05:25:01.250 --> 05:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
biennium would extrapolate out but if
 
05:25:02.930 --> 05:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
you are going to increase to a number
 
05:25:04.310 --> 05:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
you see here you'd probably want to
 
05:25:06.890 --> 05:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
revisit that 50 increase or would
 
05:25:08.690 --> 05:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
get pretty pretty large really quick
 
05:25:11.208 --> 05:25:11.218 align:start position:0%
we're just doing the same thing quicker
 
05:25:14.510 --> 05:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh yeah you're getting to your well the
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs kids you're getting
 
05:25:18.350 --> 05:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
to the extraordinary needs quicker and
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
then you're gonna decide how you want to
 
05:25:21.050 --> 05:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
handle the whole harmless if you're
 
05:25:21.060 --> 05:25:22.788 align:start position:0%
handle the whole harmless if you're
right

05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:25:25.910 --> 05:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
so can't we just say that this
 
05:25:29.150 --> 05:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
application relies only for this
 
05:25:29.160 --> 05:25:31.610 align:start position:0%
application relies only for this
biennium

05:25:31.610 --> 05:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
05:25:34.310 --> 05:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
05:25:37.490 --> 05:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
would um
 
05:25:39.650 --> 05:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:25:44.030 --> 05:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:44.040 --> 05:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:50.208 --> 05:25:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:53.750 --> 05:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
it is anyway yeah right right I mean if
 
05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
not if we take the governor's scenario
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
going out 10 years yeah I mean you could
 
05:26:00.590 --> 05:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
not do 10 years of changes and just
 
05:26:04.190 --> 05:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
change it fiscal 24 and 25 and in each
 
05:26:05.570 --> 05:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
year thereafter and then that's the
 
05:26:07.250 --> 05:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
formula set and then it would be up to
 
05:26:08.930 --> 05:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
Future changes if you wanted to go that
 
05:26:10.970 --> 05:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
road but you need to as we mentioned
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
earlier today you can't just say for
 
05:26:14.690 --> 05:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 it's this way and fiscal 25 is
 
05:26:16.670 --> 05:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
that way and then be silent on 26 and
 
05:26:18.250 --> 05:26:18.260 align:start position:0%
Beyond you have to legislate something
 
05:26:20.930 --> 05:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
but I would just be careful about using
 
05:26:22.970 --> 05:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
the 50 increase if you do increase
 
05:26:25.368 --> 05:26:25.378 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs yeah it's not as
 
05:26:28.010 --> 05:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
much a question as a reminder that
 
05:26:31.550 --> 05:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
if we change the extraordinary needs
 
05:26:34.128 --> 05:26:34.138 align:start position:0%
Grant we absolutely have to change those
 
05:26:36.590 --> 05:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
percentages otherwise I'm gonna have to
 
05:26:39.410 --> 05:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
vote no just because I can do the math
 
05:26:42.470 --> 05:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
10 years down the road and I cannot
 
05:26:44.990 --> 05:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
bypass any legislation regardless of how
 
05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
much I know that it will be changed in
 
05:26:48.830 --> 05:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
the future but I cannot vote Yes on
 
05:26:50.750 --> 05:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that if allowed to go on for
 
05:26:56.390 --> 05:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:01.730 --> 05:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
yeah so an option is to Simply set the
 
05:27:04.368 --> 05:27:04.378 align:start position:0%
rate if you decide to move the equalized
 
05:27:06.050 --> 05:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
or the extraordinary needs to a certain
 
05:27:08.628 --> 05:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
level and not and and have the two
 
05:27:10.490 --> 05:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
percent for instance apply to that right
 
05:27:12.470 --> 05:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know we we already talked about that
 
05:27:15.410 --> 05:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
two percent uh adjustment applying to
 
05:27:17.690 --> 05:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
the base Aid and the differentiated you
 
05:27:19.610 --> 05:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
could apply it to that too so
 
05:27:23.270 --> 05:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
it grows smaller and now the the 10-year
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
plan the governor's put forward is is
 
05:27:27.410 --> 05:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
now a shorter plan and probably might
 
05:27:28.850 --> 05:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
need to be Revisited in another
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
legislative session because we're
 
05:27:31.550 --> 05:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
starting with a higher base starting
 
05:27:34.010 --> 05:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
with a higher base you know and then the
 
05:27:35.390 --> 05:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
question is how you'd want to handle the
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
whole harmless
 
05:27:38.990 --> 05:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
but you could still keep that same pace
 
05:27:41.570 --> 05:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
of reducing it by 20 for the next five
 
05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
bienniums but you're not going to
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
increase the extraordinary needs at that
 
05:27:48.530 --> 05:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
same Pace because you've already got it
 
05:27:49.910 --> 05:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
pretty high
 
05:27:52.128 --> 05:27:52.138 align:start position:0%
but that
 
05:27:54.890 --> 05:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
you're I mean from what I I don't know
 
05:27:57.050 --> 05:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
what the governor's total estimate for
 
05:27:59.690 --> 05:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
fiscal 26 and 27
 
05:28:02.208 --> 05:28:02.218 align:start position:0%
education funding is but yours would be
 
05:28:03.890 --> 05:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
higher because you're
 
05:28:05.930 --> 05:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
cranking that extraordinary needs a lot
 
05:28:05.940 --> 05:28:13.670 align:start position:0%
cranking that extraordinary needs a lot
sooner

05:28:13.670 --> 05:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:17.150 --> 05:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
so would you like to sleep on it
 
05:28:19.490 --> 05:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
or you have a favorite
 
05:28:20.990 --> 05:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
I just have one I just have another
 
05:28:22.850 --> 05:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
question and it's probably the same
 
05:28:24.530 --> 05:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
question I may have asked already in a
 
05:28:26.690 --> 05:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
different form I don't know what the
 
05:28:28.368 --> 05:28:28.378 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs you're saying that
 
05:28:28.378 --> 05:28:29.208 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs you're saying that
would

05:28:29.208 --> 05:28:29.218 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:28:31.730 --> 05:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
um we're going to be adding to it and is
 
05:28:34.730 --> 05:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
that still coming from the Surplus the
 
05:28:37.270 --> 05:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
education trust fund Surplus yeah
 
05:28:39.708 --> 05:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
adequacies paid for the education trust
 
05:28:41.448 --> 05:28:41.458 align:start position:0%
fund as far as surpluses and everything
 
05:28:43.610 --> 05:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
goes right now as we've heard from
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler he will be
 
05:28:47.150 --> 05:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
bringing forward an amendment for the
 
05:28:48.530 --> 05:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
committee to consider that's going to
 
05:28:50.690 --> 05:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
drastically change how you see the
 
05:28:52.250 --> 05:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
education trust fund in the Surplus
 
05:28:54.410 --> 05:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
statement so it is going to drastically
 
05:28:56.150 --> 05:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
change it is going to drastically change
 
05:28:57.830 --> 05:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
so what we're working with here is just
 
05:29:01.390 --> 05:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
this 96. that's yeah as of right now
 
05:29:03.530 --> 05:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
represent representative Weiler is
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
speaking about an amendment to shift all
 
05:29:06.890 --> 05:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
kinds of revenues from the education
 
05:29:08.570 --> 05:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
trust fund and programs to the general
 
05:29:08.580 --> 05:29:09.530 align:start position:0%
trust fund and programs to the general
fund

05:29:09.530 --> 05:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:29:13.490 --> 05:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
and that Surplus would likely follow so
 
05:29:15.170 --> 05:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
and it would essentially become General
 
05:29:17.270 --> 05:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
funds at that point and uh you know so
 
05:29:19.010 --> 05:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
that and that Amendment hasn't really
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
thoroughly been uh offered yet to review
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
but that's the gist of what he's been
 
05:29:23.520 --> 05:29:25.310 align:start position:0%
but that's the gist of what he's been
discussing

05:29:25.310 --> 05:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
05:29:27.170 --> 05:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you some members of the committee
 
05:29:29.510 --> 05:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
are of the opinion that you can't
 
05:29:32.690 --> 05:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
transfer funds from the education trust
 
05:29:41.390 --> 05:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:44.090 --> 05:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
I think we can I think the only I mean
 
05:29:46.550 --> 05:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
but it would take statutory change uh
 
05:29:49.550 --> 05:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
right yes great the only the only thing
 
05:29:51.410 --> 05:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
that's constitutionally protected is
 
05:29:52.730 --> 05:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
Lottery Revenue has to go to public
 
05:29:55.730 --> 05:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
schools and that's 158 million of the
 
05:29:58.010 --> 05:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
1.2 billion dollar education trust fund
 
05:29:59.690 --> 05:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
but the other revenues are subject to
 
05:30:04.970 --> 05:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
statute RSA 198 39 whatever it is so you
 
05:30:06.530 --> 05:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
can Define what goes into the education
 
05:30:08.330 --> 05:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
trust fund and what it's used for and
 
05:30:09.770 --> 05:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
those sections are actually already in
 
05:30:12.170 --> 05:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. because as you recall the
 
05:30:13.850 --> 05:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal added a couple
 
05:30:15.730 --> 05:30:15.740 align:start position:0%
programs to the education trust fund
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler is talking about
 
05:30:19.788 --> 05:30:19.798 align:start position:0%
removing those plus others to the
 
05:30:21.470 --> 05:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
general fund as well as a lot of Revenue
 
05:30:24.948 --> 05:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:27.708 --> 05:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I have I just would like to go
 
05:30:28.850 --> 05:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
over a narrative a little bit to
 
05:30:30.470 --> 05:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
understand a little more what's going on
 
05:30:33.050 --> 05:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
here in terms of the schools that are
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
more well often the schools that aren't
 
05:30:39.650 --> 05:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
so no one is no one's going to end up
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
with less money uh with what we're doing
 
05:30:43.610 --> 05:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to get something it's
 
05:30:45.830 --> 05:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
just a magnitude of what and so I was
 
05:30:48.350 --> 05:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
looking at yeah in the next two years
 
05:30:48.360 --> 05:30:49.070 align:start position:0%
looking at yeah in the next two years
um

05:30:49.070 --> 05:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:51.250 --> 05:30:51.260 align:start position:0%
in the governor's regular with Deerfield
 
05:30:54.350 --> 05:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
with proposal 10 it goes up 10 it goes
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
up a little bit and in proposal 11 it
 
05:30:59.390 --> 05:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
goes down about by half and proposal 12
 
05:31:01.850 --> 05:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
it goes down by half again and I'm
 
05:31:03.948 --> 05:31:03.958 align:start position:0%
attributing that to there's lesser need
 
05:31:06.770 --> 05:31:06.780 align:start position:0%
in the Deerfield area than there are in
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
other places and I was comparing that to
 
05:31:09.948 --> 05:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
Concord which is in another League
 
05:31:13.610 --> 05:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
anyway but the governor's regular is the
 
05:31:13.620 --> 05:31:14.750 align:start position:0%
anyway but the governor's regular is the
three

05:31:14.750 --> 05:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:31:18.050 --> 05:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
and then with the proposal 10
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
that boosts up to seven uh seven I guess
 
05:31:25.070 --> 05:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
million proposal 11 and proposal 12 both
 
05:31:27.110 --> 05:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
brings it up close to nine and close to
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
ten and this is reflective of the
 
05:31:31.910 --> 05:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
greater need in Concord
 
05:31:34.550 --> 05:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm
 
05:31:36.830 --> 05:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
coming back to the thing everyone has an
 
05:31:38.208 --> 05:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
increase everything is everyone's going
 
05:31:41.090 --> 05:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit better off and the
 
05:31:42.170 --> 05:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
differences that I'm seeing between
 
05:31:44.890 --> 05:31:44.900 align:start position:0%
proposal 10 11 and 12
 
05:31:48.890 --> 05:31:48.900 align:start position:0%
the larger numbers going up reflect
 
05:31:51.288 --> 05:31:51.298 align:start position:0%
greater need in the schools and the
 
05:31:52.970 --> 05:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
numbers where it's going down reflect
 
05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
schools that are probably doing okay and
 
05:31:57.288 --> 05:31:57.298 align:start position:0%
you know I looked quickly at Newcastle
 
05:31:59.050 --> 05:31:59.060 align:start position:0%
there's like no change you know there's
 
05:32:02.868 --> 05:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
nothing for us to do there but I think
 
05:32:02.878 --> 05:32:03.770 align:start position:0%
nothing for us to do there but I think
um

05:32:03.770 --> 05:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:05.690 --> 05:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
when I'm thinking of this I'm trying to
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that every school is going
 
05:32:11.448 --> 05:32:11.458 align:start position:0%
to get an increase and if our goal is to
 
05:32:14.208 --> 05:32:14.218 align:start position:0%
get more funding towards the programs
 
05:32:16.190 --> 05:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
that really need it
 
05:32:16.200 --> 05:32:16.850 align:start position:0%
that really need it
um

05:32:16.850 --> 05:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
11 and 12 are perhaps better than that
 
05:32:21.910 --> 05:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
12 maybe goes is asking maybe too much
 
05:32:24.410 --> 05:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
and 11 is
 
05:32:25.788 --> 05:32:25.798 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps a little I don't know
 
05:32:27.948 --> 05:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
11 is somewhere between 10 and 12
 
05:32:30.288 --> 05:32:30.298 align:start position:0%
obviously but I'm trying to say I'm
 
05:32:32.868 --> 05:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
trying to just really focus on if we
 
05:32:34.788 --> 05:32:34.798 align:start position:0%
said that we wanted to get money to
 
05:32:37.250 --> 05:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
schools that have greater need then I
 
05:32:39.350 --> 05:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
need to look at this information with
 
05:32:44.208 --> 05:32:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:47.810 --> 05:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
yes Dan just wanted to state that I
 
05:32:49.910 --> 05:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
appreciated discussion is more about 10
 
05:32:51.650 --> 05:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
11 12 because that's the new information
 
05:32:54.410 --> 05:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
in front of the committee but I do want
 
05:32:56.750 --> 05:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
to point out that you know three to nine
 
05:32:58.910 --> 05:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
are still on the table too and uh you
 
05:33:00.530 --> 05:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
know when we make decisions probably
 
05:33:02.930 --> 05:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
tomorrow all of those are on the table
 
05:33:05.750 --> 05:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
but indeed this is the time to analyze
 
05:33:11.090 --> 05:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:14.390 --> 05:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:18.310 --> 05:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
did you catch the drift of what we did
 
05:33:20.628 --> 05:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
I just wanted you to be clued in because
 
05:33:22.910 --> 05:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
what we did is we added 20 million
 
05:33:25.128 --> 05:33:25.138 align:start position:0%
dollars in each fiscal year
 
05:33:27.770 --> 05:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh to be distributed through
 
05:33:31.368 --> 05:33:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:33.288 --> 05:33:33.298 align:start position:0%
is the and it's probably a question for
 
05:33:36.170 --> 05:33:36.180 align:start position:0%
you Mickey but uh is is the 20 million
 
05:33:37.310 --> 05:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
dollars what's boosting the
 
05:33:40.550 --> 05:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs in proposal 10 so
 
05:33:43.030 --> 05:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's bringing it from 650 to
 
05:33:45.470 --> 05:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
3750. okay
 
05:33:45.480 --> 05:33:46.850 align:start position:0%
3750. okay
and

05:33:46.850 --> 05:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
I mean that I I think we defer to the
 
05:33:51.530 --> 05:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
legislature on where the additional
 
05:33:54.650 --> 05:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
funding goes I think we our position is
 
05:33:56.690 --> 05:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
still that we believe that the
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended is is the most
 
05:34:01.250 --> 05:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
appropriate for what everyone's trying
 
05:34:03.230 --> 05:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
to achieve balancing all the interests
 
05:34:03.240 --> 05:34:05.390 align:start position:0%
to achieve balancing all the interests
however

05:34:05.390 --> 05:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:34:07.788 --> 05:34:07.798 align:start position:0%
um if if you're intending to add
 
05:34:10.910 --> 05:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
additional funding you know proposal 10
 
05:34:13.310 --> 05:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
looks looks interesting I I'd have to
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
study it a little bit more but
 
05:34:16.910 --> 05:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
um but that's that's kind of where I
 
05:34:20.930 --> 05:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:22.250 --> 05:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
so does anybody have any other questions
 
05:34:24.230 --> 05:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
before you go home and dream about this
 
05:34:26.690 --> 05:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
again can I ask Tom representative Buco
 
05:34:27.830 --> 05:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
um you know under the under let's look
 
05:34:31.670 --> 05:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
at proposal 10 because I'm kind of
 
05:34:33.410 --> 05:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
leaning towards
 
05:34:35.868 --> 05:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
um adding the money for the the right
 
05:34:38.448 --> 05:34:38.458 align:start position:0%
side of the formula so under proposal 10
 
05:34:41.448 --> 05:34:41.458 align:start position:0%
uh there's an additional 359. I'm in
 
05:34:44.390 --> 05:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
Conway sorry incense since
 
05:34:46.010 --> 05:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
representative bucco's here well you
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned Conway so you're around 12
 
05:34:49.788 --> 05:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
million dollars is this my um do I have
 
05:34:52.368 --> 05:34:52.378 align:start position:0%
enough zeros here or is it 12 million
 
05:34:55.010 --> 05:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
yes okay so your 12 million dollars in
 
05:34:55.020 --> 05:34:56.090 align:start position:0%
yes okay so your 12 million dollars in
Conway

05:34:56.090 --> 05:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
Conway
 
05:34:58.250 --> 05:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
um the regular Governors recommended is
 
05:35:01.490 --> 05:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
351 000 uh proposal 10 which adds a
 
05:35:02.810 --> 05:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
little bit to the right side gets you
 
05:35:06.890 --> 05:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
359 000. 11 and 12 get enough there's
 
05:35:08.990 --> 05:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
not you don't get an additional thing
 
05:35:11.390 --> 05:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
there right right I'm sorry looking
 
05:35:14.270 --> 05:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
right below there's Cornish
 
05:35:17.930 --> 05:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
which is a 2 million and under
 
05:35:21.288 --> 05:35:21.298 align:start position:0%
the governor's 10 11 12.
 
05:35:24.230 --> 05:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
there's no increase for them okay so
 
05:35:26.930 --> 05:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking is
 
05:35:29.868 --> 05:35:29.878 align:start position:0%
because Conway is in pretty good shape
 
05:35:31.970 --> 05:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
you have a good budget you can support
 
05:35:34.010 --> 05:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
your budget
 
05:35:37.430 --> 05:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
how hard is it to for you to go like
 
05:35:39.470 --> 05:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
proposal 11 to try to explain that to
 
05:35:41.330 --> 05:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
your people it's it's a matter of you
 
05:35:45.050 --> 05:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
know 350 000 which is not
 
05:35:46.910 --> 05:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
Hue it's it's money it's a lot of money
 
05:35:49.010 --> 05:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
but it's not huge compared to your 12
 
05:35:51.410 --> 05:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
million dollar school budget
 
05:35:53.030 --> 05:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
um that you know I'm asking because you
 
05:35:54.470 --> 05:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
you brought up the question what do I
 
05:35:56.570 --> 05:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
say to my people so could can you
 
05:35:59.110 --> 05:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
explain to your people say proposal 11
 
05:36:01.788 --> 05:36:01.798 align:start position:0%
that we put in money for Extraordinary
 
05:36:03.050 --> 05:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
well I keep saying I guess the
 
05:36:04.850 --> 05:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs is the best way to
 
05:36:06.350 --> 05:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
describe it or the right side of the
 
05:36:09.410 --> 05:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
formula and Conway is affluent enough
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
not to need that so I mean how do you
 
05:36:13.730 --> 05:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
talk to your constituents giving that if
 
05:36:15.530 --> 05:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
you want 11 and 12 you would not get an
 
05:36:15.540 --> 05:36:20.208 align:start position:0%
you want 11 and 12 you would not get an
increase

05:36:20.208 --> 05:36:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:22.490 --> 05:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
um well anything that anything that
 
05:36:25.128 --> 05:36:25.138 align:start position:0%
takes away and increase is not going to
 
05:36:25.138 --> 05:36:26.150 align:start position:0%
takes away and increase is not going to
be

05:36:26.150 --> 05:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:36:26.160 --> 05:36:27.128 align:start position:0%
be
um

05:36:27.128 --> 05:36:27.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:29.708 --> 05:36:29.718 align:start position:0%
acceptable acceptable and
 
05:36:32.270 --> 05:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
there is no take away you would still
 
05:36:34.128 --> 05:36:34.138 align:start position:0%
get the 12 million three hundred and
 
05:36:36.770 --> 05:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand there's no loss there's
 
05:36:38.690 --> 05:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
just not and little increase but there's
 
05:36:41.150 --> 05:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
no loss that's the that's um the
 
05:36:43.128 --> 05:36:43.138 align:start position:0%
adequacy is the 12 million is that right
 
05:36:46.190 --> 05:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
because that's that's not the total the
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:50.638 --> 05:36:52.128 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:36:52.128 --> 05:36:52.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:53.570 --> 05:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean I asked that
 
05:36:55.250 --> 05:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
question because that's what we normally
 
05:36:56.990 --> 05:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
what what happens if there's anything
 
05:36:59.030 --> 05:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
taken away I you know you go home and
 
05:37:00.948 --> 05:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
they say you you
 
05:37:02.868 --> 05:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
've already watching it to probably
 
05:37:05.628 --> 05:37:05.638 align:start position:0%
right now and um you know they say that
 
05:37:07.368 --> 05:37:07.378 align:start position:0%
you know you voted for something that
 
05:37:10.250 --> 05:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
took money away from us
 
05:37:12.170 --> 05:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
it didn't take anything away it just
 
05:37:14.150 --> 05:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
didn't add but it did not right it
 
05:37:16.128 --> 05:37:16.138 align:start position:0%
didn't add but it did not take away and
 
05:37:17.690 --> 05:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
it didn't add because you don't have the
 
05:37:20.270 --> 05:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
needs that other communities do okay I
 
05:37:24.050 --> 05:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
assume where you're going now thank you
 
05:37:26.090 --> 05:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you does can does that make is
 
05:37:28.010 --> 05:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
that a story you can tell that would be
 
05:37:31.128 --> 05:37:31.138 align:start position:0%
comfortable for your constituents
 
05:37:34.430 --> 05:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
yes I think so but the other thing is
 
05:37:36.470 --> 05:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're not going to see this
 
05:37:38.390 --> 05:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at comparative
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
data they're not going to see comparison
 
05:37:39.660 --> 05:37:42.470 align:start position:0%
data they're not going to see comparison
well

05:37:42.470 --> 05:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:37:45.410 --> 05:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay so what what representative Heath
 
05:37:49.250 --> 05:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
is saying that is the 47 still stays and
 
05:37:51.650 --> 05:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's what that's
 
05:37:53.150 --> 05:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
and yes
 
05:37:55.010 --> 05:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
and that's what people see that's what
 
05:37:57.650 --> 05:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
they're going to see so if that stays
 
05:37:57.660 --> 05:38:02.570 align:start position:0%
they're going to see so if that stays
that

05:38:02.570 --> 05:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:05.990 --> 05:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I know
 
05:38:09.708 --> 05:38:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.390 --> 05:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
05:38:13.970 --> 05:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate you know all these
 
05:38:16.010 --> 05:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
projections all of them assume that we
 
05:38:19.010 --> 05:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
are gonna take the governor's funding as
 
05:38:21.170 --> 05:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
recommended or we're gonna add you know
 
05:38:23.510 --> 05:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
significant amounts
 
05:38:26.030 --> 05:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'm still stressed by the fact that we
 
05:38:29.208 --> 05:38:29.218 align:start position:0%
don't really know whether we can go
 
05:38:30.830 --> 05:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
forward with even the governor's
 
05:38:33.170 --> 05:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
proposal as is which I would hope we can
 
05:38:35.390 --> 05:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
but since I don't know that for a fact
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate to ask me to
 
05:38:39.410 --> 05:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
Mickey to prepare a couple of
 
05:38:42.170 --> 05:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
scenarios where we may need to cut a
 
05:38:43.970 --> 05:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
little from the adequacy or is the view
 
05:38:45.830 --> 05:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee that that is in
 
05:38:48.170 --> 05:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
absolutely not the possibility and we
 
05:38:50.090 --> 05:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
don't want to spend stuff time on it we
 
05:38:51.410 --> 05:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
have it to spend that's not a question
 
05:38:53.690 --> 05:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
okay so this is not the question that's
 
05:38:56.270 --> 05:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
perfectly for I'm asking because I want
 
05:39:00.410 --> 05:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
to be prepared for every possibility
 
05:39:02.570 --> 05:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
the I'm not sure what the possibilities
 
05:39:07.368 --> 05:39:07.378 align:start position:0%
are but I will uh here you know I got it
 
05:39:11.810 --> 05:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
well between yeah between this
 
05:39:14.208 --> 05:39:14.218 align:start position:0%
and this are really what the
 
05:39:15.948 --> 05:39:15.958 align:start position:0%
possibilities I am
 
05:39:18.050 --> 05:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
um one separate question if I may it's a
 
05:39:19.430 --> 05:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up to this if I could really
 
05:39:21.830 --> 05:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
quickly separate question one of the
 
05:39:24.288 --> 05:39:24.298 align:start position:0%
things that uh chairman land who's uh
 
05:39:27.890 --> 05:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
here uh was asking um at the beginning
 
05:39:30.590 --> 05:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
of the lunch break was the possibility
 
05:39:32.270 --> 05:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
of maybe putting more money in the
 
05:39:36.170 --> 05:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
special education that's a left side you
 
05:39:36.180 --> 05:39:37.368 align:start position:0%
special education that's a left side you
know

05:39:37.368 --> 05:39:37.378 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:39:39.590 --> 05:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
um and I was wondering if we would maybe
 
05:39:42.050 --> 05:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
consider a scenario similar to scenarios
 
05:39:44.448 --> 05:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
three to nine where instead of you know
 
05:39:46.850 --> 05:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
putting money into the extraordinary
 
05:39:49.070 --> 05:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
needs Grant we could run an analysis on
 
05:39:50.930 --> 05:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
what happens if we take a little bit
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
from the base and put it into the
 
05:39:55.490 --> 05:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
special education just trying to cover
 
05:39:57.288 --> 05:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
contingencies I don't want to waste
 
05:39:58.970 --> 05:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
anybody's time if this is something the
 
05:40:00.708 --> 05:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
committee will absolutely not consider
 
05:40:02.868 --> 05:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
but I just want to ask and know what our
 
05:40:04.368 --> 05:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
options are at this time I've got 11
 
05:40:05.868 --> 05:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
different we've got 11 different
 
05:40:09.350 --> 05:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:11.628 --> 05:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
yes I think also representative Ladd was
 
05:40:13.010 --> 05:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
very clear that
 
05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
um the increase in sped is not going to
 
05:40:17.690 --> 05:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
Target property poor communities because
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
we all understand that special education
 
05:40:23.690 --> 05:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
is not zip code dependent and that you
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
know everyone shares equally in special
 
05:40:28.550 --> 05:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
education needs across the state
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
and there are everybody's getting more
 
05:40:39.050 --> 05:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:41.750 --> 05:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to change lanes real quick
 
05:40:45.650 --> 05:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
we've been having uh our meetings are
 
05:40:48.288 --> 05:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
being observed and we had a call from
 
05:40:48.298 --> 05:40:49.730 align:start position:0%
being observed and we had a call from
unh

05:40:49.730 --> 05:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
unh
 
05:40:54.288 --> 05:40:54.298 align:start position:0%
about making they were con unclear what
 
05:40:57.530 --> 05:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
our position was on the 8 million
 
05:40:59.930 --> 05:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
dollars for
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
I just lost it yes so Whittemore Center
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
is an open item we have and they do have
 
05:41:05.750 --> 05:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
one pending request they're business
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with Keene State and
 
05:41:09.350 --> 05:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
Plymouth States a five million dollar
 
05:41:11.690 --> 05:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
request they can be available at 10
 
05:41:13.128 --> 05:41:13.138 align:start position:0%
o'clock tomorrow morning to just answer
 
05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
any questions that come up to just I
 
05:41:16.910 --> 05:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
think this Committee just needs to
 
05:41:18.110 --> 05:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
decide on those two items probably
 
05:41:21.170 --> 05:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
sooner than later so uh
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
um Kathy provencher and uh president
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
Dean can be here tomorrow at 10 o'clock
 
05:41:30.708 --> 05:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
to discuss if is that necessary or
 
05:41:30.718 --> 05:41:31.970 align:start position:0%
to discuss if is that necessary or
I

05:41:31.970 --> 05:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:41:35.090 --> 05:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
I think some of us at any rate are
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
really in favor of some of those
 
05:41:39.410 --> 05:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
proposals but the problem is we don't
 
05:41:41.208 --> 05:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
know how much money we have to spend in
 
05:41:42.890 --> 05:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
05:41:44.510 --> 05:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
um so I know we're going to be going
 
05:41:46.550 --> 05:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
through a I hope a few more things on
 
05:41:48.650 --> 05:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
this sheet so we know kind of where we
 
05:41:50.868 --> 05:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
are in terms of General funds but that's
 
05:41:53.150 --> 05:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
the problem I think we all want to be
 
05:41:54.970 --> 05:41:54.980 align:start position:0%
able to support the university system
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and Keane both have some needs
 
05:42:00.590 --> 05:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
as well and they didn't ask they only
 
05:42:03.770 --> 05:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
asked for uh they only they asked for
 
05:42:06.410 --> 05:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
five million dollars oh for the across
 
05:42:07.850 --> 05:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
05:42:10.730 --> 05:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
um so we have neglected our University
 
05:42:12.830 --> 05:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
system schools and our community
 
05:42:15.410 --> 05:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
colleges so if we can do something for
 
05:42:17.628 --> 05:42:17.638 align:start position:0%
them I'm all for it well I think the
 
05:42:19.610 --> 05:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
question is because the Whittemore
 
05:42:24.110 --> 05:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
Center is coming out of uh Surplus
 
05:42:26.510 --> 05:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
is there is we don't know where we are
 
05:42:28.490 --> 05:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
because everybody's spending the Surplus
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
we've probably spent it twice so far so
 
05:42:34.070 --> 05:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
similarly yes precisely three divisions
 
05:42:36.770 --> 05:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
meeting right now and it's ever changing
 
05:42:37.850 --> 05:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
um and we're still waiting for some
 
05:42:39.590 --> 05:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
guidance some bigger picture guidance of
 
05:42:42.230 --> 05:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
some budget targets uh but as far as
 
05:42:43.850 --> 05:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
this this division can proceed at any
 
05:42:47.330 --> 05:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
time to re-purpose or re-prioritize some
 
05:42:48.530 --> 05:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
of the Appropriations that were before
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
you for instance if you wanted to reduce
 
05:42:54.050 --> 05:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
Whittemore by x amount and add that X to
 
05:42:55.128 --> 05:42:55.138 align:start position:0%
a different thing you can do that
 
05:42:56.090 --> 05:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
without worrying about the other
 
05:42:59.868 --> 05:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
divisions as far as just adds to that we
 
05:43:01.250 --> 05:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
just need to be careful a little bit how
 
05:43:02.390 --> 05:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
much we do and we just want to
 
05:43:03.830 --> 05:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
communicate that
 
05:43:06.050 --> 05:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
so my I I guess what I'm trying to get
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
to is do we want is there a need to have
 
05:43:10.490 --> 05:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
them come or it's really a question of
 
05:43:13.128 --> 05:43:13.138 align:start position:0%
do we have the funds to spend and right
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
now we're allocating it for the
 
05:43:16.910 --> 05:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
Whittemore Center and it's really if you
 
05:43:19.010 --> 05:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
need if the committee feels you need any
 
05:43:21.110 --> 05:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
more information from UNH I know we've
 
05:43:22.368 --> 05:43:22.378 align:start position:0%
had them in a couple times to talk about
 
05:43:24.050 --> 05:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
these items but they are available if
 
05:43:25.850 --> 05:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
you feel you do need them back
 
05:43:28.910 --> 05:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
what's the feeling of the board I got a
 
05:43:28.920 --> 05:43:30.010 align:start position:0%
what's the feeling of the board I got a
question

05:43:30.010 --> 05:43:30.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:43:34.368 --> 05:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
right uh can I come out of the uh
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
I did it's it's very bright very bright
 
05:43:39.530 --> 05:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
let me tell you this is uh I'm in I'm in
 
05:43:42.770 --> 05:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
Spotlight unfortunately can we take that
 
05:43:44.330 --> 05:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh with a more Center out of the
 
05:43:46.430 --> 05:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
05:43:48.170 --> 05:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
so again statutorily you can write
 
05:43:49.788 --> 05:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
anything into the education trust fund
 
05:43:52.070 --> 05:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
but your chair has an amendment to pull
 
05:43:53.628 --> 05:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
all that education trust fund money away
 
05:43:58.128 --> 05:43:58.138 align:start position:0%
so right if we take the 40 million out
 
05:44:00.590 --> 05:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
all right we've still got another 46 uh
 
05:44:02.628 --> 05:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
no 56. the chair has talked about taking
 
05:44:04.368 --> 05:44:04.378 align:start position:0%
all of that Surplus to the general fund
 
05:44:06.590 --> 05:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
oh he's going to sweep it yes so that's
 
05:44:07.970 --> 05:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
that's the discussion we don't have it
 
05:44:11.350 --> 05:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
to spend anymore unless we spend it as
 
05:44:13.910 --> 05:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
I would just recommend coordination with
 
05:44:16.010 --> 05:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
chairwyler this is stuff he's discussed
 
05:44:18.470 --> 05:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
online and offline so so we should we
 
05:44:21.650 --> 05:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
should consider the other five million
 
05:44:24.350 --> 05:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
not out of surplus but out of Education
 
05:44:28.368 --> 05:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:31.788 --> 05:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to ask I'll defer to what
 
05:44:32.810 --> 05:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
the committee wants to do in
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
communication with the chair and others
 
05:44:36.470 --> 05:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
and we can talk about that tomorrow
 
05:44:38.750 --> 05:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
I mean we this is a short decision yeah
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
just one quick thing when ccsnh was here
 
05:44:44.030 --> 05:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
this morning one of the reasons why they
 
05:44:46.128 --> 05:44:46.138 align:start position:0%
were able to get the requests approved
 
05:44:48.350 --> 05:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
was that they brought us updated numbers
 
05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
that were lower now I don't really
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
expect that for waiter more and I'm not
 
05:44:53.330 --> 05:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
sure if that would be something that
 
05:44:55.970 --> 05:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
would be applicable to the 5 million
 
05:44:58.730 --> 05:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
but you know if that's a possibility
 
05:45:00.650 --> 05:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
that I would definitely want to hear
 
05:45:02.390 --> 05:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
that from you know straight from the
 
05:45:05.930 --> 05:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
horse's mouth as it were that you know
 
05:45:08.208 --> 05:45:08.218 align:start position:0%
maybe a smaller amount maybe appropriate
 
05:45:10.190 --> 05:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
or not I mean to me those are the kind
 
05:45:12.048 --> 05:45:12.058 align:start position:0%
of conversations that would help overall
 
05:45:13.310 --> 05:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
I think we've already heard the
 
05:45:15.048 --> 05:45:15.058 align:start position:0%
presentation as I don't think we need
 
05:45:17.208 --> 05:45:17.218 align:start position:0%
them for just repeating what was already
 
05:45:19.610 --> 05:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
said but if they do have new stuff it
 
05:45:19.620 --> 05:45:21.708 align:start position:0%
said but if they do have new stuff it
would

05:45:21.708 --> 05:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:45:23.990 --> 05:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
however I don't think you think
 
05:45:24.000 --> 05:45:24.590 align:start position:0%
however I don't think you think
um

05:45:24.590 --> 05:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:27.110 --> 05:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
we haven't been given guidance in terms
 
05:45:29.150 --> 05:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
of you know what our parameters would be
 
05:45:31.250 --> 05:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
I would be in favor of just supporting
 
05:45:32.868 --> 05:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
it all and saying yeah we do want to
 
05:45:34.970 --> 05:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
support this and if it comes down the
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
pike later on they're saying well sorry
 
05:45:37.730 --> 05:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
you know we should have let you know you
 
05:45:39.530 --> 05:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
didn't have that money to begin with I
 
05:45:41.150 --> 05:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
think it's still a statement to say I'm
 
05:45:43.610 --> 05:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
I'm I support these ideas I'm trying to
 
05:45:45.530 --> 05:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
work really hard to figure out what the
 
05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
budget and what the parameters are but
 
05:45:49.070 --> 05:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
if I'm not given that direction as to
 
05:45:54.650 --> 05:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:59.350 --> 05:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:59.360 --> 05:46:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
interoperability

05:46:01.190 --> 05:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
interoperability
 
05:46:03.350 --> 05:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
and the Whittemore Center
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
no I think the the
 
05:46:08.628 --> 05:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
five million they're talking about
 
05:46:22.548 --> 05:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:32.628 --> 05:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:38.930 --> 05:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:40.788 --> 05:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
you know those those are strong programs
 
05:46:42.110 --> 05:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
and they do pay for themselves I think
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
in the long run around Workforce
 
05:46:44.400 --> 05:46:45.708 align:start position:0%
in the long run around Workforce
um

05:46:45.708 --> 05:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:48.770 --> 05:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm certainly support the
 
05:46:50.570 --> 05:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
concept of it I'd be glad to support it
 
05:46:52.788 --> 05:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
I could see supporting that at half the
 
05:46:52.798 --> 05:46:55.430 align:start position:0%
I could see supporting that at half the
request

05:46:55.430 --> 05:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:00.170 --> 05:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:03.170 --> 05:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's only uh 2025 if I'm
 
05:47:03.180 --> 05:47:04.250 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's only uh 2025 if I'm
correct

05:47:04.250 --> 05:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:47:07.610 --> 05:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
oh you're right yes yes okay
 
05:47:07.620 --> 05:47:08.570 align:start position:0%
oh you're right yes yes okay
Dan

05:47:08.570 --> 05:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
Dan
 
05:47:10.788 --> 05:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
it would be much more likely to vote in
 
05:47:13.548 --> 05:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
favor of such things tomorrow after we
 
05:47:15.650 --> 05:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
would have an update from all the other
 
05:47:17.530 --> 05:47:17.540 align:start position:0%
divisions and the summary and everything
 
05:47:20.510 --> 05:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just sharing that honestly I want to
 
05:47:22.250 --> 05:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
support these things but I cannot do it
 
05:47:23.810 --> 05:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
at this point in time because of the
 
05:47:26.030 --> 05:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
huge uncertainty over how much the
 
05:47:27.650 --> 05:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
bottom line how far we are from the
 
05:47:29.930 --> 05:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
bottom line so if if you guys want to
 
05:47:31.730 --> 05:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
vote right now we can vote right now but
 
05:47:33.230 --> 05:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
tomorrow would be probably more
 
05:47:36.048 --> 05:47:36.058 align:start position:0%
productive as a vote
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
so I agree with you I think you know
 
05:47:38.040 --> 05:47:39.110 align:start position:0%
so I agree with you I think you know
about

05:47:39.110 --> 05:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:47:41.810 --> 05:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
um my where you're being cautious to say
 
05:47:43.368 --> 05:47:43.378 align:start position:0%
you want to wait I'm saying since we
 
05:47:44.690 --> 05:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision and these things
 
05:47:48.350 --> 05:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:48.360 --> 05:47:51.650 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:47:51.650 --> 05:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:54.470 --> 05:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
I'm moving into the spotlight here good
 
05:47:54.480 --> 05:48:02.230 align:start position:0%
I'm moving into the spotlight here good
night

05:48:02.230 --> 05:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:04.368 --> 05:48:04.378 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm certainly not going to
 
05:48:06.350 --> 05:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of the trustees but I am
 
05:48:08.030 --> 05:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
a trustee for the University system of
 
05:48:09.048 --> 05:48:09.058 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:48:11.690 --> 05:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
and I would
 
05:48:14.150 --> 05:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
I would absolutely when you get an offer
 
05:48:16.010 --> 05:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
from Jim Dean who's the academic
 
05:48:17.990 --> 05:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
Chancellor before both Keane Plymouth
 
05:48:21.890 --> 05:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
State and UNH and with Kathy provencher
 
05:48:25.190 --> 05:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
to come in I think 15 20 minutes of them
 
05:48:27.530 --> 05:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
tomorrow would really be a benefit to
 
05:48:29.510 --> 05:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
you where you can Grill down through
 
05:48:30.948 --> 05:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
some of these questions you've been just
 
05:48:33.048 --> 05:48:33.058 align:start position:0%
asking now
 
05:48:33.058 --> 05:48:38.410 align:start position:0%
asking now
okay

05:48:38.410 --> 05:48:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:40.910 --> 05:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
well by dividing things in half and
 
05:48:42.650 --> 05:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
doing this and that and we might ask
 
05:48:44.628 --> 05:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
okay what's that going to do over there
 
05:48:47.390 --> 05:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
at the biggest problem is if
 
05:48:49.850 --> 05:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler is saying that
 
05:48:52.010 --> 05:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
he's going to sweep the education trust
 
05:48:54.410 --> 05:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
and the 96 million dollars we've been
 
05:48:57.288 --> 05:48:57.298 align:start position:0%
talking about we need to know that
 
05:48:59.510 --> 05:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
um if you could put a date of 25 on it
 
05:49:03.230 --> 05:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
then we could continue as we're working
 
05:49:04.430 --> 05:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
um so he would do it in a future
 
05:49:07.310 --> 05:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
biennium not this biennium because it's
 
05:49:09.230 --> 05:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to go back and sort
 
05:49:11.448 --> 05:49:11.458 align:start position:0%
through what's general fund now and
 
05:49:14.390 --> 05:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
unless well as you said Mickey I think
 
05:49:16.910 --> 05:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
we can make the 96 million dollars go
 
05:49:19.128 --> 05:49:19.138 align:start position:0%
away which means the 40 million that we
 
05:49:20.990 --> 05:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
just put into this formula might be
 
05:49:24.770 --> 05:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:26.890 --> 05:49:26.900 align:start position:0%
I think his intention
 
05:49:29.690 --> 05:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
the net net of his intention is to
 
05:49:31.850 --> 05:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
reduce the inflows
 
05:49:37.910 --> 05:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:37.920 --> 05:49:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:49:41.090 --> 05:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
I I don't remember saying anything about
 
05:49:43.128 --> 05:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
sweeping anything I think what he was
 
05:49:45.770 --> 05:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
talking about was reducing the inflows
 
05:49:48.170 --> 05:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
so that it starts moving down towards
 
05:49:51.350 --> 05:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
what base adequacy is all about
 
05:49:52.850 --> 05:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
so and that's
 
05:49:54.970 --> 05:49:54.980 align:start position:0%
you know that's what we have okay then
 
05:49:58.448 --> 05:49:58.458 align:start position:0%
very quickly I do not plan to adjust my
 
05:50:01.730 --> 05:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
votes on spending based on whether the
 
05:50:03.530 --> 05:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
funding is from the
 
05:50:06.830 --> 05:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
fund or from the general funds whether
 
05:50:08.208 --> 05:50:08.218 align:start position:0%
it's from the trust fund on the general
 
05:50:10.490 --> 05:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
fund the priorities remain the same to
 
05:50:12.470 --> 05:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
me so to me that whole thing is just a
 
05:50:13.970 --> 05:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
matter of which pocket stuff is coming
 
05:50:16.250 --> 05:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
from it doesn't change my bottom line it
 
05:50:18.288 --> 05:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
doesn't change my spending so if we vote
 
05:50:20.390 --> 05:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
to support something because it's coming
 
05:50:22.430 --> 05:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
from the trust fund and then we change
 
05:50:24.288 --> 05:50:24.298 align:start position:0%
the way the money goes in the trust fund
 
05:50:26.750 --> 05:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
I will absolutely vote for that to go
 
05:50:28.670 --> 05:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund you know it's
 
05:50:31.970 --> 05:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
it it shouldn't change what we budget
 
05:50:35.930 --> 05:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
for this in this budget so
 
05:50:39.170 --> 05:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
what we have is the 96 million that's in
 
05:50:42.110 --> 05:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
this trust fund Surplus statement
 
05:50:44.708 --> 05:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything that says sweep
 
05:50:47.690 --> 05:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
no and if he unless he comes in and says
 
05:50:49.970 --> 05:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
that we have this if he comes in and
 
05:50:51.890 --> 05:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
says I'm sweeping well then we don't
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
have anything anyway then then our whole
 
05:50:55.850 --> 05:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
budget goes to hell so I don't know if
 
05:50:57.708 --> 05:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the answer so we'll
 
05:50:59.330 --> 05:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
find out and I think he needs to bring
 
05:51:00.948 --> 05:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
that proposal in so what that would do
 
05:51:02.930 --> 05:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
is just move the education trust funds
 
05:51:04.250 --> 05:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
to General funds but that doesn't mean
 
05:51:05.628 --> 05:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
they couldn't still be spent as general
 
05:51:08.930 --> 05:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
funds at that point so right so yeah you
 
05:51:10.788 --> 05:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
know so
 
05:51:12.650 --> 05:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
I ideally
 
05:51:14.810 --> 05:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
this amendment would be
 
05:51:16.788 --> 05:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
communicated and brought forward and
 
05:51:18.708 --> 05:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
clear what is going on but I can just
 
05:51:21.110 --> 05:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
say that at this point that discussion
 
05:51:23.930 --> 05:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
has been made that he's he's working on
 
05:51:25.430 --> 05:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
something and
 
05:51:26.868 --> 05:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
I'm starting to feel like we're probably
 
05:51:28.610 --> 05:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
not going to get a whole lot done today
 
05:51:30.770 --> 05:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
that's kind of my feeling right now I
 
05:51:31.850 --> 05:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
think we've done all we're going to do
 
05:51:37.730 --> 05:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:37.740 --> 05:51:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:51:39.590 --> 05:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:39.600 --> 05:51:40.610 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

05:51:40.610 --> 05:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:51:42.410 --> 05:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
I think some of these smaller things
 
05:51:43.970 --> 05:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
you'd probably be okay with if you
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
support them so for instance so go to
 
05:51:47.930 --> 05:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
page three
 
05:51:49.610 --> 05:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
there's a couple I don't know there's
 
05:51:51.350 --> 05:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety has brought forward
 
05:51:53.090 --> 05:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
the request for a lot of new positions
 
05:51:55.250 --> 05:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
here that were additional prioritized
 
05:51:56.570 --> 05:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
needs right through their agency budget
 
05:51:57.830 --> 05:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
request did not make it into the
 
05:51:59.868 --> 05:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget so they
 
05:52:02.270 --> 05:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
were communicated here just as an
 
05:52:05.090 --> 05:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
example if you look at the homeland
 
05:52:06.170 --> 05:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
security and emergency management
 
05:52:08.510 --> 05:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
position on lines three through six it's
 
05:52:11.330 --> 05:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
only 112 000 General funds if this is a
 
05:52:13.788 --> 05:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
something that the committee supports
 
05:52:15.470 --> 05:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
and it's a priority of this committee
 
05:52:17.628 --> 05:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
and you support the request you could
 
05:52:19.070 --> 05:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
probably make a change like that and not
 
05:52:20.270 --> 05:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
have to worry about blowing up the
 
05:52:22.548 --> 05:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
budget with 100 which line was that so
 
05:52:24.970 --> 05:52:24.980 align:start position:0%
why is three through six
 
05:52:27.288 --> 05:52:27.298 align:start position:0%
my issue with that though this this is
 
05:52:28.850 --> 05:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
an executive branch
 
05:52:31.310 --> 05:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
and if the governor didn't want it I
 
05:52:33.890 --> 05:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
don't know the and that's and that's a
 
05:52:35.810 --> 05:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to look at these two that
 
05:52:38.270 --> 05:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
they with the governor's spending levels
 
05:52:39.890 --> 05:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
and and priorities these didn't make
 
05:52:41.990 --> 05:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
there so they were communicated to you
 
05:52:44.330 --> 05:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
as customary that these are additional
 
05:52:45.890 --> 05:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
prioritizing these that were not in the
 
05:52:47.208 --> 05:52:47.218 align:start position:0%
governors I don't think there's any
 
05:52:49.490 --> 05:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
requirement that that you support them
 
05:52:50.750 --> 05:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
either they were just brought forward to
 
05:52:52.970 --> 05:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
your cons for your consideration
 
05:52:55.490 --> 05:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh as far as there's nothing on here
 
05:52:57.170 --> 05:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
that I'm looking at that I you know I'm
 
05:52:58.548 --> 05:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
looking at that you need to do this for
 
05:53:01.010 --> 05:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
because there's a house bill 2 section
 
05:53:03.650 --> 05:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
or this law this bill is out there these
 
05:53:05.270 --> 05:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
are purely just brought forward to you
 
05:53:07.430 --> 05:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
as funding requests and they're up to
 
05:53:12.350 --> 05:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:15.548 --> 05:53:15.558 align:start position:0%
okay well I
 
05:53:18.410 --> 05:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
somewhere uh we're totaling this up
 
05:53:21.410 --> 05:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:23.330 --> 05:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
so at some point if somebody's gonna hit
 
05:53:24.590 --> 05:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
the total button and say well we've
 
05:53:26.030 --> 05:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
triple spent it
 
05:53:28.310 --> 05:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
the total button could get pressed and
 
05:53:29.930 --> 05:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
you realize you're dipping into the
 
05:53:31.610 --> 05:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund to balance your budget or
 
05:53:33.170 --> 05:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
it could get pressed of say you're
 
05:53:35.330 --> 05:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
spending you're sending you know another
 
05:53:37.310 --> 05:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
80 million to the rainy day fund maybe
 
05:53:38.930 --> 05:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
you only want to spend 60 do you want to
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
do something with a 20. I don't have
 
05:53:41.810 --> 05:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
those numbers here right now I don't
 
05:53:44.628 --> 05:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
well one thing to look at with um what
 
05:53:45.948 --> 05:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
three four and five where we are right
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
now is that some of that money I guess
 
05:53:49.730 --> 05:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
it's federal funds and then there's
 
05:53:52.128 --> 05:53:52.138 align:start position:0%
other funds which is not specified but
 
05:53:54.410 --> 05:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's not a big ask from the general
 
05:53:56.510 --> 05:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
fund and I'm always fond of money that's
 
05:53:59.390 --> 05:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
matched from someplace else so what item
 
05:54:00.890 --> 05:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
are you looking at um the safety the
 
05:54:02.810 --> 05:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
homeland security emergencies at
 
05:54:05.090 --> 05:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
management line three four five and then
 
05:54:07.128 --> 05:54:07.138 align:start position:0%
it's totaled on six so you know what
 
05:54:08.750 --> 05:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
they're looking for the general fund is
 
05:54:10.368 --> 05:54:10.378 align:start position:0%
a hundred and twelve thousand over the
 
05:54:12.650 --> 05:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
two years matched by the federal and
 
05:54:14.990 --> 05:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
then another 96 coming from other
 
05:54:17.030 --> 05:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
so you know that's other money that's
 
05:54:18.830 --> 05:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
that's there
 
05:54:21.110 --> 05:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
um presumably would it go away if we
 
05:54:24.070 --> 05:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
didn't match it is often a question
 
05:54:27.110 --> 05:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm I'm support funds when it's
 
05:54:29.510 --> 05:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
when there's other funds coming into it
 
05:54:31.250 --> 05:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
and this is just up to the committee if
 
05:54:32.990 --> 05:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
you want to establish two new positions
 
05:54:34.610 --> 05:54:34.620 align:start position:0%
too so there's a policy point of view
 
05:54:36.590 --> 05:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's dollars associated with
 
05:54:38.750 --> 05:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
it but then it's creating two new
 
05:54:40.788 --> 05:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh Folks at Homeland Security and
 
05:54:42.890 --> 05:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management so that's an
 
05:54:45.170 --> 05:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
example and you don't even have to force
 
05:54:46.670 --> 05:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
votes today if you're not feeling like
 
05:54:47.990 --> 05:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're in a place to do them I was just
 
05:54:49.368 --> 05:54:49.378 align:start position:0%
bringing that up as an example of
 
05:54:50.990 --> 05:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's a couple items on here that
 
05:54:52.548 --> 05:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
aren't huge dollars it's more of a do
 
05:54:55.910 --> 05:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
support that request or not
 
05:54:58.490 --> 05:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
yes honestly when I look at that whole
 
05:55:01.010 --> 05:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
block of safety requests the one that I
 
05:55:03.170 --> 05:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
remember being more uh
 
05:55:06.350 --> 05:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
you know struck by is a priority is the
 
05:55:08.390 --> 05:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
number of criminalists in the forensic
 
05:55:10.368 --> 05:55:10.378 align:start position:0%
lab where everything is delayed by a
 
05:55:12.890 --> 05:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
mile those are not federally matched but
 
05:55:14.868 --> 05:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
I would argue that Federal match or not
 
05:55:17.330 --> 05:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
you know to me that seems like a bigger
 
05:55:20.890 --> 05:55:20.900 align:start position:0%
priority than the you know HSA hsem
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
positions and
 
05:55:26.690 --> 05:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's yeah well let's just say that in
 
05:55:29.570 --> 05:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
about 28 hours or so we should be
 
05:55:33.650 --> 05:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:35.628 --> 05:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
well we know what the
 
05:55:37.070 --> 05:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
what the votes are going to be tomorrow
 
05:55:40.548 --> 05:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
so so think about it
 
05:55:42.708 --> 05:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
with column are you
 
05:55:42.718 --> 05:55:43.910 align:start position:0%
with column are you
most

05:55:43.910 --> 05:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
most
 
05:55:46.250 --> 05:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
likely for
 
05:55:49.610 --> 05:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
I know I know where I am
 
05:55:52.190 --> 05:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
to me the the big decisions for this
 
05:55:53.930 --> 05:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
committee are still the adequacy like
 
05:55:55.548 --> 05:55:55.558 align:start position:0%
you said Mr chairman School building Aid
 
05:55:57.288 --> 05:55:57.298 align:start position:0%
and then policy with the education trust
 
05:55:59.208 --> 05:55:59.218 align:start position:0%
fund those are and I'm tracking those as
 
05:56:00.770 --> 05:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
the three biggest things remaining
 
05:56:02.990 --> 05:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
everything else here is they're there
 
05:56:04.850 --> 05:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
but it's not quite as important as those
 
05:56:06.170 --> 05:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
three so those are the ones I'm gonna
 
05:56:08.628 --> 05:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
really push that we settle on tomorrow
 
05:56:08.638 --> 05:56:11.208 align:start position:0%
really push that we settle on tomorrow
okay

05:56:11.208 --> 05:56:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:15.788 --> 05:56:15.798 align:start position:0%
say again 10. yeah
 
05:56:18.708 --> 05:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
with the additional 40 million Oh I
 
05:56:20.930 --> 05:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
thought you meant we start at 10.
 
05:56:22.610 --> 05:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
Oh I thought you were asking me what
 
05:56:24.770 --> 05:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
time we start tomorrow so no I'm I'm in
 
05:56:29.830 --> 05:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:33.170 --> 05:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
yes and I think to Tom's Point that's
 
05:56:34.430 --> 05:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
kind of like that's the number
 
05:56:36.830 --> 05:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's been hearing and so if we
 
05:56:38.868 --> 05:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
deviate from that I think the torn
 
05:56:41.930 --> 05:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
feather come back out that's my concern
 
05:56:45.470 --> 05:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where I am but that's
 
05:56:46.610 --> 05:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
not necessarily where the vote's gonna
 
05:56:48.110 --> 05:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
go afterwards you're going to get salt
 
05:56:51.708 --> 05:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:56.030 --> 05:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:58.010 --> 05:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
bring your voting pin tomorrow because
 
05:56:59.330 --> 05:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
or your
 
05:57:01.490 --> 05:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
voting Voice or whatever
 
05:57:03.110 --> 05:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
because we will be voting these out
 
05:57:03.120 --> 05:57:04.430 align:start position:0%
because we will be voting these out
tomorrow

05:57:04.430 --> 05:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
05:57:06.650 --> 05:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for your work Mickey welcome
