38fn

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
38fn
 
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
a bill having to do with the bail and
 
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.810 align:start position:0%
a bill having to do with the bail and
detention

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 align:start position:0%
detention
 
00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 align:start position:0%
of modifying Provisions in 597.
 
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
so that we can attain
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
some recovery
 
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
from the rampant crime that we've seen
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of years since bail
 
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.710 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of years since bail
reform

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
reform
 
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
and make make the law a little tighter
 
00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
we can't go on the six o'clock news
 
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.650 align:start position:0%
we can't go on the six o'clock news
without

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
hearing about watching some horrific
 
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
crime all over the United States and
 
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
including some horrific crimes in the
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire here
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm not gonna go and enumerate them
 
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
there's more than enough to spread
 
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.290 align:start position:0%
there's more than enough to spread
around

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
but my the object of my bill is
 
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.330 align:start position:0%
but my the object of my bill is
basically

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
we want to put some balance back in the
 
00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
law to enable justices to make
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
some fair and balanced decisions
 
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.150 align:start position:0%
some fair and balanced decisions
by

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
bringing the weight of evidence from
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing down to
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
like a 51 percent versus 75 percent
 
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.090 align:start position:0%
like a 51 percent versus 75 percent
standard

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
and why do we need this well
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing from people who coached me
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
on preparation of this bill
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
and other folks that um
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the doubt
 
00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
goes too much to the criminal to the
 
00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
detriment of Public Safety
 
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
and judges may be faced with well I got
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
70 percent but I need 75 so I'm going to
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
have to defer out to release instead of
 
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.730 align:start position:0%
have to defer out to release instead of
detention

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
detention
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
so that's a big component of it
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
um the 2018 bail reform
 
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
upset those traditional standards that
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
we could now have balanced and effective
 
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.050 align:start position:0%
we could now have balanced and effective
Justice

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
the other component is to eliminate
 
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
the financial Test Escape patch
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
if you commit a crime
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
but you're Indigent financially limited
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
then you get a special pass
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
well how do the criminals read this
 
00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
boy this is this is a real Gumdrop this
 
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
is a Christmas present because they're
 
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 align:start position:0%
out and that's the incentive for them
 
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
and other people seeing this that oh you
 
00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 align:start position:0%
have a special pathway
 
00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:10.909 align:start position:0%
have a special pathway
um

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
to clear yourself out of trouble
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
and this is one more thing that is given
 
00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:21.139 align:start position:0%
to the incentive for crime
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:24.529 align:start position:0%
and then
um

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.689 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:28.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
provisions of
 
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
secured and unsecured bail
 
00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
we want to take that unsecured
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
component out of the bail equation
 
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
because there's abuse happening there
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
and I don't have some figures but maybe
 
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
some testimony can come forward to see
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
how much unsecured bail is being
 
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.350 align:start position:0%
how much unsecured bail is being
violated

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
violated
 
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
or abused
 
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
so we got these three components and
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
there's others not all of them are in my
 
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill but these are the three that I
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
another one that's not in my bill is um
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
breach of bail
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
we don't seem to have a uniform standard
 
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
through the state so if crime is
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
committed and there's um a bail
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
probation situation in one town and they
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
come to Claremont and
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
and commit another one we we can't seem
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
to use the prior for an aggregation
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
of um bail and so we're we're suffering
 
00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:39.290 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
the idea of Public Safety is Paramount
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
in my bill
 
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:46.790 align:start position:0%
in my bill
um

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
people are are watching the news and
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
they're watching their neighbors uh
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
being attacked and people are scared and
 
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
they're uncertain of their safety
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
in their homes in their cars walking on
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
the street
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
we need to instill some balance back
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
into the law
 
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
for Public Safety that's got to be
 
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.530 align:start position:0%
for Public Safety that's got to be
primary

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.970 align:start position:0%
primary
without

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.550 align:start position:0%
without
um

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
destroying or or
 
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
compromising the constitutionality of
 
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
every defendant
 
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
but we do need to restore the balance a
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
2018 bail reform around the country has
 
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
been a disaster and if we don't fix it
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to worsen
 
00:09:35.769 --> 00:09:35.779 align:start position:0%
so that basically is the summation of my
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
presentation here and I would take
 
00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:40.370 align:start position:0%
presentation here and I would take
questions

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you um could you speak to
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
your your thoughts on the uh the cash
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
bail part of it
 
00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:49.550 align:start position:0%
bail part of it
um

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
you you said that you you think that we
 
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
should eliminate that
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
um could you speak to what you think it
 
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
should be and also
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
um how you what do you think about
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
um the potential for people who are just
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
so poor that they have no way of getting
 
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.230 align:start position:0%
so poor that they have no way of getting
out

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
um if I heard you correctly if the cash
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
bail yes question yeah
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
um as to the amount
 
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.670 align:start position:0%
um as to the amount
um

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
I do not operate within the criminal
 
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
justice system and I wish I had some
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
more experience relative to that
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
but I really can't say because I don't
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
know the extent of how cash bail
 
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.019 align:start position:0%
requirements are are assisted in the
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
court fair enough in my second part of
 
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
um part of the the driving force behind
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
the change was the argument that
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
um being poor should not relegate you to
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
stay in jail what is your response to
 
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.870 align:start position:0%
stay in jail what is your response to
that

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
to the folks that just say look we we
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
can't I can't afford a hundred dollars
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
well you know that goes to the root of
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
um we've given them an escape patch and
 
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons we see such
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
Sally an increase in crime all kinds of
 
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.130 align:start position:0%
Sally an increase in crime all kinds of
crime

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
crime
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
if you do the crime you know you've got
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
you've got an answer for it and you know
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
if you're found guilty you do the time
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
and if if you can't come up with the
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
bail you have maybe family friends or
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
assistants or bail bondsmen um
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know there are Avenues here that you
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
have and maybe if you can't make bail
 
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a lesson for you
 
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
sitting in The Slammer for a while that
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
um representative Murray
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering if you had any
 
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
statistics or numbers that could back up
 
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
like there being an increase in crime or
 
00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:52.339 align:start position:0%
is this based on anecdotal evidence
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm having difficulty hearing
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
the question my hearing aids are not
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
working here I'm sorry
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if you have
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
statistics to back up uh your claims
 
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
that crime has risen or if it's based on
 
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:07.640 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
I I do not have um
 
00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:12.829 align:start position:0%
I I do not have um
statistics

00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
available that that I can readily relate
 
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not being I'm not familiar with this
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
particular aspect I know there's a
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
problem I'm citing the problem I bring
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
them forth to the committee
 
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
um perhaps those who are following in
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
testimony can provide answers to those
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
questions with a lot more satisfaction
 
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.420 align:start position:0%

last week the Valley news paper up in

our area carried a front page story of
 
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
one of the largest seizures of fentanyl
 
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
by the Hanover police ever The Saga
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
started with um Saga started with a
 
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:24.260 align:start position:0%
mid-January early morning crash report
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
from a rental car in the village of
 
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
Aetna by the time the police were
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
statically driving down a Hanover Road
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
and later
 
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.290 align:start position:0%
and later
um

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:35.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
uh caught up with in a parking lot in
 
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
your downtown Hanover the driver
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
obviously impaired consented to a
 
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
sobriety test and failed and she was
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
jailed in Haverhill over the holiday
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
weekend in mid-January meanwhile police
 
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
were looking for uh were asking for a
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
search warrant for her car
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
but by the time they got it she had been
 
00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:01.019 align:start position:0%
processed and released
 
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
in the car the police found 2200 tablets
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
of Fentanyl
 
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
and worth about twenty five thousand
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
dollars and 180 grams of meth the drugs
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
were only discovered after the police
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
had obtained their warrant but by then
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
the driver was gone and she is still at
 
00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:18.949 align:start position:0%
the driver was gone and she is still at
Large

00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
Large
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
the newspaper story goes on to talk
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
about how technology in cars especially
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
rental car we respond to crashes and
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
other car emergencies
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
but what's left unanswered is the
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
question why was this woman released
 
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
before her car was searched
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
perhaps time had elapsed and she was no
 
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
longer impaired
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
however most reasonable people would
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
think that a previous DUI
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
being known to police throughout New
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
England and the fact that a search
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
Lawrence was in process for your car
 
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
would be enough to keep someone in jail
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
at least until the search warrant is
 
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.930 align:start position:0%
at least until the search warrant is
settled

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
settled
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
today you're going to hear from a lot of
 
00:16:59.930 --> 00:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
people much more qualified than I am on
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
the technical aspects of this bill but I
 
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to introduce you to a recent real
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
life example where a change from clear
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
and convinced convincing evidence to a
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence might have
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
resulted in someone now known to be
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
involved in one of Hanover's largest
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
fentanyl seizures being behind bars
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
instead of on the loose I urge you to
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
pass House Bill 38 and I'm willing to
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative on the case you
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
just talked about
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
um she was arrested for DUI a second DUI
 
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
second offense DUI did she have any
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
other charges besides that
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
as far as I no no are you aware of what
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
her record was like at all her criminal
 
00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:47.510 align:start position:0%
her record was like at all her criminal
record

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
um I am only what using what's been in
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
public but I do know people who do okay

all right
 
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
um and I'm asking because I'm trying to
 
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
put myself in the position of the bail
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
clerk at the time what they knew or did
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
not know
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
um any further questions you know thank
 
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
 
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:14.090 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
you

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh the chair calls David Rothstein
 
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:27.289 align:start position:0%
uh the chair calls David Rothstein
Steen

00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:27.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is David Rothstein
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
I was a public defender for over 30
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
years including one of the directors of
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
the program I'm now in private criminal
 
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
practice and I'm here on behalf of the
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of criminal
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys and speaking in
 
00:18:47.289 --> 00:18:47.299 align:start position:0%
opposition to changing the bill bill
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
and full well understanding the the
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
emotions and the feelings of people who
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
have proposed this bill full
 
00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
understanding the the need that we all
 
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
have to try to prevent an increase in
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
crime but not believing that further
 
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.490 align:start position:0%
crime but not believing that further
um

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
tinkering with this Veil statute is is
 
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
the answer the statute will make it
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
easier to detain people for a longer
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
time it'll make it harder for people to
 
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
get out on bail and I I don't believe
 
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
that that's the direction that we should
 
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
be focusing on I think we should be
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
focusing on a few different things one
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
is training the people who are involved
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the bail process judges prosecutors
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
and defense attorneys to come together
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
to try to make better decisions these
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
decisions are not necessarily or should
 
00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be adversarially we
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
should be trying to look out for what
 
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
the best interest is for the community
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
and for this person and there's a severe
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
lack of training in this very important
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
area it just seems to kind of go by the
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
wayside it's a very short little bit on
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
the docket these hearings happen they
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
pass and decisions are made
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
the second thing that I think resources
 
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
should be put into would be information
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
a lot of times when we're getting these
 
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
cases and when I'm called upon to do a
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
bail hearing for somebody the case is on
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock I have a short phone
 
00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:18.059 align:start position:0%
conversation with somebody at the jail I
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
get some information from them the
 
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
prosecutor has their criminal record and
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
the judges called upon to make a very
 
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:25.340 align:start position:0%
difficult decision
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
in the federal system there's an entire
 
00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:30.059 align:start position:0%
report that's done by a neutral party
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
they interview the person they do report
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
for the judge they make a recommendation
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
there's a severe lack of information
 
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
about the person that I think could
 
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
contribute both ways in some of these
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
cases that may have led to the person
 
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
being detained in other cases where
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
someone is detained that may lead to the
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
person being released
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
the third issue is resources a lot of
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
the people who are being held in jail
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
are not these outliers the most
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous people the people you hear
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
about in the headlines they're people
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
who are poor they're people who suffer
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
from mental illness there are people who
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
suffer from substance use disorder and
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
frankly a lot of these people are being
 
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
ending up detained in jail because the
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
judge doesn't want to let them out the
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
judge doesn't have the community
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
resources that the judge feels confident
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
in that if they get out on bail that
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
there's going to be somebody who's going
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
to be looking after them getting them
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
maybe medically assisted treatment
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
getting them help for their mental
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
illness there's a significant resource
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
issue here that could be addressed I
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
think in in large part we're talking
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
about humans making decisions about
 
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059 align:start position:0%
humans and no matter what you do with
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
the statute whatever you call the
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
standard it's still going to be humans
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
making decisions about humans they're
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
going to be occasional after the fact
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
situations where you're going to say
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
well in that case it seems like a
 
00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:54.539 align:start position:0%
mistake was made and we can learn from
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
those situations but I think that
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
squeezing the the bill on both ends here
 
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
where we make it easier to detain people
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
and harder for people to get out the
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
most likely consequence is you're going
 
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
to have more people sitting in jail who
 
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
are mentally ill who are poor who are
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
suffering from substance use disorder
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
and sitting in jails that do not have
 
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
the capacity to take care of these
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
people and they're going to be sitting
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
there for a long period of time far to
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
their detriment if they were able to get
 
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
out of jail and have resources where
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
they could be productive then in the
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
long run when their case comes up for
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
sentencing they're less likely to get a
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
sentence where they have to go back to
 
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
jail so we're not spending money on that
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
end so I just there's been a lot of of
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
tinkering with this Bell statute I know
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
it's well intended I know people are
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
trying to get it right I I just don't
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
think there's significant evidence that
 
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
that's going to address this problem in
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
a meaningful way way so I'd be glad to
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
address any questions anyone has
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a quick question sure
 
00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
you said lack of full information and
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
you compared it to the federal system
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
what exact information are you talking
 
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
about that you feel like is not
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
available to the judge or bail Clerk or
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
whoever at the time
 
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
right so basic the basic case that comes
 
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:10.610 align:start position:0%
right so basic the basic case that comes
up

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
um you get a call there's a felony's
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
first arraignment list at one o'clock
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
you get a call that morning as late as
 
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
11 or 12 o'clock there's going to be a
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
bail hearing at one o'clock so you get
 
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
on the phone you talk to somebody who's
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
at the jail you get some information
 
00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
from them you don't have the opportunity
 
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
to obviously you don't know the person
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
unless they're a former client of yours
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
which is unlikely you don't have the
 
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to corroborate the
 
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
information you do the best you can the
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is kind of in the same boat
 
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
they have a file they look in their file
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
they say oh this person has no criminal
 
00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:47.900 align:start position:0%
record this person has a criminal record
 
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
this person did not show up for court
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
therefore I'm going to recommend
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
detention and the judge has that in
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
front of the judge and that's that's a
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
very difficult situation the judge is
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
not neither side neither the defense nor
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
the state have a lot of information
 
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
therefore they're not able to give the
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
judge a lot of information and therefore
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
the judge has to make a call in the
 
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
federal system my understanding is that
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
there is a pre-trial release person who
 
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
does sort of a report for the judge I'm
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
going to testify
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
um I just have a question from the
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
perspective of a of a defense attorney
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
what the what the full impact of the
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
change in the evidence evidentiary
 
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
standards in the bill what how that
 
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
would actually play out uh in court in
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
the legal system right and I think
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question because
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
these phrases clear and convincing
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
evidence preponderance of the evidence
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
they're they're debated in terms of what
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
they they mean preponderance of the
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
evidence typically means more than 50
 
00:24:48.419 --> 00:24:49.850 align:start position:0%
evidence typically means more than 50
percent

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
um so 51 clear and convincing evidence
 
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
is below Beyond A Reasonable Doubt but
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly where it is I
 
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
think that the it's difficult to explain
 
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.330 align:start position:0%
think that the it's difficult to explain
um

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
with Precision how it would play out but
 
00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419 align:start position:0%
I think the message that the legislature
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
would be sending to to the judges is
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
that more people should be detained
 
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
um that um there should be
 
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
um less than clear and convincing
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
evidence for detention and that if
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
someone is looking to overcome a
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption on the other side
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
that they should be released there
 
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
should be more there should be clear and
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence the more than a
 
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence so I think
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
the way it would practically play out is
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
it would result in more people being
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
more people being detained it would
 
00:25:41.529 --> 00:25:41.539 align:start position:0%
result in more contested bail hearings
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
it would result in in expending more
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
resources in in terms of the bail
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
determination just having that battle
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
over whether the state has met its
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
standard and I I do think that more
 
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
resources should be committed to to bail
 
00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:57.419 align:start position:0%
to make good decisions I I just don't
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that changing these
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
standards or making it
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
if we're going to make it more likely
 
00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:06.299 align:start position:0%
that someone should be detained I think
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
we should be doing it based on that
 
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
person's Story the information about
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
that person I think a lot of times we
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
fear what we don't understand and if
 
00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
somebody comes into court and you hear
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
that they're mentally ill that they're
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
suffering from substance use disorder
 
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
you're like well that person clearly
 
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
can't be released maybe they can if you
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
learn more about them and I don't know
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
that changing those words or changing
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
those standards I know the message it
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
sends but I just don't know that it does
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
much good for that person
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
um or for the system as a whole
 
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.810 align:start position:0%
um or for the system as a whole
oh

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:37.820 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
is is it fair to say that if you change
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
the words without changing the resources
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
you haven't accomplished much that
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
I I think I think that is a good way of
 
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
putting what I'm trying to say I think
 
00:26:54.649 --> 00:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
basically you get the same you know you
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
get the same problem of this lack of
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
when I see a lack of training
 
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
information and resources you can change
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
the words but that nothing else is
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
happening I think there are some
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
counties like Stratford county has an
 
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:09.059 align:start position:0%
active Community Corrections program
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a it's kind of like a
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
pre-trial probation where if they take
 
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:15.299 align:start position:0%
you uh if they take your supervision
 
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
you're kind of like on probation before
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
your charge comes up and they know where
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
you're living and they know
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
um you know they try to help you get
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
ideally they try to help you get back on
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
your feet to try to get a job to try to
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
take care of your substance use disorder
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
some people need that they need that
 
00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:36.059 align:start position:0%
structure and they benefit from that
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
structure it's very as you hear counties
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
are very uneven other counties you're
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
just if you're released you're just
 
00:27:44.769 --> 00:27:44.779 align:start position:0%
thrown on the streets on a day like this
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
and that's probably not going to be good
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
so I do think that resources need to be
 
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.690 align:start position:0%
so I do think that resources need to be
addressed

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
um and resources you know they obviously
 
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
cost money but I think if you put more
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
money into that end I think you're
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
ultimately saving money on the other
 
00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:00.299 align:start position:0%
hand because the person is going to do
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
better and they may not need to go to
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
I have a question that's kind of a
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that because it's about a
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
change of words
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
so same thing like the question you just
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
asked what kind of effect would this
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
have and I'm looking particularly at
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
section on Roman numeral seven which is
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
about the second defense and whatever
 
00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:29.900 align:start position:0%
um that and and it says that the
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
individuals shall be detained without
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
shall be detained without bail not may
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
be detained they change it from May to
 
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.210 align:start position:0%
be detained they change it from May to
shall

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
shall
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
you know and I believe that that will uh
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
could potentially cause people in the
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
situations that you just described to be
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
detained in jail for 72 hours
 
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
right and I think that well I won't tell
 
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
you what I think do you agree could you
 
00:28:54.649 --> 00:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
just talk about that please Michelle and
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
may is a much different change I I think
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
um from uh from the perspective I mean
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
Xiao mean ciao there's no discretion
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
that that is given to whether it's a
 
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
magistrate which comes up later whether
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's a bail commission whether it's a
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
judge it has to be that way
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
um and you know in some cases that that
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
is probably the right decision
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
um I think again it depends on the
 
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
situation I certainly can see that in
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
some cases the the right decision if
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
someone commits another offense while
 
00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
they're out on bail is going to be that
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
they shall be held but this if this
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
wording is any felony any misdemeanor
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
and that's a pretty broad spectrum of
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
people I mean there are some pretty
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
benign misdemeanors and even pretty
 
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
benign felonies I'm sorry
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh and my follow-up to that would be
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
most of your discussion so far has dealt
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
with people that don't have the
 
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
wherewithal don't have what else in the
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
community of that but will this not have
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
a uh an effect on anybody who gets
 
00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:00.059 align:start position:0%
has a second Offense for whatever the
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
reason and we don't know what it is it
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
could be a benign reason would it also
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
have an effect on a large bigger group
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
of people people who have just committed
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
one of those crimes and now is caught in
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
this shall be detained for 72-hour
 
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
situation absolutely I think as a as a
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
practical matter
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
um the the cases that we see tend to be
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
people of more limited resources who
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
have these other issues the mental
 
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
illness issues the substance use issues
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
but you're absolutely correct it would
 
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
be it's shall it's anybody so it's it it
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
covers anyone who commits any other
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
offense while out on bail as long as
 
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
it's a misdemeanor no matter what it is
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
good morning uh my name is Buzz sure I'm
 
00:31:20.409 --> 00:31:20.419 align:start position:0%
a professor of law at UNH School of Law
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm also a elected Police Commissioner
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
in the town of Portsmouth
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
opinions and testimony today are my own
 
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
they're not those of unh UNH law or the
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth police commission or
 
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.690 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth police commission or
Department

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.430 align:start position:0%
Department
um

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
before I address the uh investigation
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
the report that's being passed around a
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
couple things on what we've already
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
heard number one since bail reform
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
passed the crime rate in New Hampshire
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
is down 18 percent
 
00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:54.059 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
that's a from National statistics number
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
two the change from the language from
 
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence to
 
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
preponderance to the evidence for a
 
00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
person to be held without bail
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional
 
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
under a case named U.S versus Salerno
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
that requires if you're going to detain
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
somebody without bail you're entitled to
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
a due process hearing and the burden of
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
proof must be by clear and convincing
 
00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:22.370 align:start position:0%
proof must be by clear and convincing
evidence

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh so uh number three the statute
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
already addresses repeat offenders there
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
already exist mechanisms in the statute
 
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
to deal with people who commit uh after
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
they've been released on bail as a
 
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
previous uh witness testified it's a
 
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
matter of human beings doing their job
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
um and uh actually raising issues like
 
00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:51.470 align:start position:0%
um and uh actually raising issues like
that

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
um let me talk now about
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
um well I add one more thing uh uh the
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill uh referred to uh
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
people who are the issues uh surrounding
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
people who've been charged with a crime
 
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
uh and referred to them as criminals
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
they're not criminals they haven't been
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
convicted yet
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
um they uh they remain innocent until
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
proven guilty and we can't build a bell
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
system that assumes that they're guilty
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's fundamentally wrong
 
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
um the study I I passed around myself uh
 
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
and a second year law student Travis
 
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:32.690 align:start position:0%
and a second year law student Travis
Bennett

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
Bennett
 
00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:34.820 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
I I did this study
 
00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:38.630 align:start position:0%
I I did this study
um

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
I have been as as I talked about last
 
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:42.889 align:start position:0%
I have been as as I talked about last
week

00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
everybody on this committee who's been
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
here before uh and I'm guessing people
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
are starting to realize who haven't been
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
on this committee before that there's
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
been a lack of data hard data as to
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
what's really going on in the system
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh and uh that's made it very difficult
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
for you members of this committee uh for
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
members of Senate Judiciary Committee to
 
00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
make evidence-based decisions about what
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
the bail statute should look like and
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
how it should uh how it should be
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
written uh what I've done with uh uh Mr
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
Bennett is uh we actually have collected
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
data we contact we we got a a series of
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
case numbers
 
00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
from the judicial Council through a 91a
 
00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:34.629 align:start position:0%
from the judicial Council through a 91a
request

00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
those case numbers allowed us to then
 
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
call up
 
00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
the phone number the court system phone
 
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
number and request what are called case
 
00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:48.500 align:start position:0%
summary sheets
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
which track the history of the case
 
00:34:56.089 --> 00:34:56.099 align:start position:0%
number what happened with that case the
 
00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
case may involve one charge three
 
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
charges four charges but they're all
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
relate to one incident and so we looked
 
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
at those case summary sheets in an
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
effort to see to what extent are people
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
who are out on bail being charged with
 
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
additional crimes when they're out on
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
bail and their bail is uh they're
 
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
they're being brought in for a breach of
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
bail or they're being charged uh uh as
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
reflected by the case summary sheet with
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
a uh a breach of bail
 
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
um and and that's what we looked at 508
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
cases we under we understood from the
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
beginning that much of the focus of this
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
failed discussion has arisen out of
 
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh the concerns expressed by
 
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
the Manchester police department and
 
00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:47.060 align:start position:0%
some Representatives so we focused on
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
Superior Court in Manchester
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
Superior Court North and we focused on
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester District Court
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
we looked at a total of 508 cases out of
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
those 508 case sheets case summary
 
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.829 align:start position:0%
those 508 case sheets case summary
sheets

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
sheets
 
00:36:06.609 --> 00:36:06.619 align:start position:0%
only four case summary sheets indicated
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
a breach of bail due to the commission
 
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
of a new kind
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
that could mean two things
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
very very very few people who are
 
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
released either on personal recognizance
 
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
fail or some form of cash fail are
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
actually then committing are being
 
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
charged with additional crimes
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
or it could mean that
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
if if that's happening
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh prosecutors are not
 
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
raising the issue
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
it with the court that uh originally
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
released them on pale could be one of
 
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
those two things but what we see on the
 
00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:47.900 align:start position:0%
case summary sheets is
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
0.79 percent
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
of the 508 cases involved a
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
documentation the case summary sheet of
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
somebody being charged being being found
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
to be in breach of bail for uh
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
committing and or being arrested for an
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
additional offense so that's piece of
 
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
information number one
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
piece of information number two uh which
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
is the second line on the quick facts
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
which is the to me the most powerful
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
piece of information
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
of the 508 case summary sheets we
 
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.109 align:start position:0%
of the 508 case summary sheets we
reviewed

00:37:26.109 --> 00:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
36.8 percent of them resulted either in
 
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
all the charges being dismissed or null
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
Prost which is the prosecution uh
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
dropping it rather than the court
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
dismissing the case
 
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
over one-third of all the case summary
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
sheets we looked at felonies and
 
00:37:43.859 --> 00:37:45.410 align:start position:0%
sheets we looked at felonies and
misdemeanors

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
I go back to what the prime sponsor said
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
that you know we need to hold these
 
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
criminals well
 
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
that's not actually the case when one
 
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
third of the circumstances their charges
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
are being dismissed that is they remain
 
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.210 align:start position:0%
are being dismissed that is they remain
innocent

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
innocent
 
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we changed the bail
 
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.010 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we changed the bail
statute

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
to increase the number of people who are
 
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
being held
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
were we one out of three people being
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
held uh would be what their cases would
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
end up being dismissed or dumped by the
 
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.990 align:start position:0%
end up being dismissed or dumped by the
prosecutor

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutor
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
so you increase the number of people
 
00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
being held you're increasing the number
 
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
of innocent people being held you're
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of people whose
 
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
cases will later be dismissed that is
 
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
they'll be held pending trial for
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
anywhere from three to six months
 
00:38:47.089 --> 00:38:47.099 align:start position:0%
perhaps more
 
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
charges will be dismissed and they have
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
interestingly the fourth fact on this
 
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
well the third fact here almost all the
 
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
cases we looked at involved the
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
imposition of a jail or prison sense
 
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
that was suspended
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
the huge majority of people in those of
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
those 508
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
are not ending up getting a jail
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
again the population we're looking at is
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
not people who we need to incarcerate
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
pre-trial because we know they're going
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
to get jail sentences later on anyway
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:36.430 align:start position:0%
and finally
um

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
speaking of resources of the 334 cases
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
we looked at that came from Superior
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
Court Hillsborough County Superior Court
 
00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
in Manchester
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
70 almost 72 percent of them
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
or drug-related offenses
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
they were not violent offenses
 
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
they were not assaults they were not
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
sexual assaults they were not homicides
 
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:05.780 align:start position:0%
they were drug-related offenses
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
the kind of case that is for lack of a
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
better way of putting it plaguing our
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
there's a prosecutors are expending a
 
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:22.460 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of resources
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
processing those cases the public
 
00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
defender program
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
is overwhelmed with drug cases and uh
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
were and those are as a relative matter
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
other than the defendants themselves
 
00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:41.579 align:start position:0%
they are relatively speaking victimless
 
00:40:41.579 --> 00:40:42.710 align:start position:0%
they are relatively speaking victimless
crimes

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
so but we need to keep in perspective
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
the kinds of cases we're actually
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.250 align:start position:0%
talking about
um

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um a couple of questions
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to the um the charges being
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
dismissed do you know what percent of
 
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
all across the state charges end up
 
00:41:10.089 --> 00:41:10.099 align:start position:0%
being dismissed uh
 
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
no uh for a couple of reasons one the
 
00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
court system does not have a data
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
collection system it only has a case
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
management system so we can't keep track
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
of that second answer is I'm a law
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
professor I get to get more than one
 
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.050 align:start position:0%
professor I get to get more than one
answer

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:26.060 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
second answer is
 
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:29.990 align:start position:0%
second answer is
um

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
two maybe three years ago I I was at
 
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
there was a study committee involving
 
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
the office of Cost Containment which is
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
the agency that collects money from poor
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
people because they're too poor to
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
afford a lawyer uh and there was
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
testimony by uh an individual from the
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
court system and the individual the
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
executive director of the public
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
defender program at that time that
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 25 and 33 percent of
 
00:42:02.569 --> 00:42:02.579 align:start position:0%
all court appointed cases that the
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
public defender got were dismissed or no
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
press so this data in this sample of of
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
case summary sheets is consistent with
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
uh what I heard two three years ago at
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
that study that that's a part of that
 
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
study committee and my last question is
 
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
in the subset that you looked at
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
what if you know or were able to glean
 
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
from it what were the the reasons that
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
they ended up being dismissed or null
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
Pros well that is not revealed in it's
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
you know in the case summary sheet it
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
just says dismissed or no process okay
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Newman
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
question and it's it I'm going back to
 
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
the question that I asked earlier in in
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
your research that you had
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
when you get a situation like a regular
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
citizen who has the first offense and it
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
may be a misdemeanor that doesn't have
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
any uh jail time with it and then maybe
 
00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:02.660 align:start position:0%
they get a minor drug
 
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
thing that that would be their second
 
00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
offense under this bill how How would
 
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
how would that affect the the that
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
situation which encompasses a lot of
 
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
people do you have any any thoughts on
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
that that you could help me with yes a
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
couple thoughts number one
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't see prosecutors offices either
 
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
in District Manchester District Court or
 
00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:27.500 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
bringing breach of Baal arguments in
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
front of the court who released that
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
individual on the first offense
 
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the second offense being
 
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
being charged that is they weren't
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
calling they weren't they had the
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
mechanism under the current bail statute
 
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
to file a motion in court saying this
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
person violated the conditions of his
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
bail on that original misdemeanor and
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
therefore we think they should be held
 
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
or their bail should be they should be
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
have to put up cash bail we saw
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
virtually none of that uh happening
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
so I understand about when you go
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
strictly by your study of breach of Baal
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
um in situations where it's not a breach
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
of Baal do you think that the change
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
from uh from shall where the discretion
 
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
is taken away from the person
 
00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:26.099 align:start position:0%
determining the bail
 
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
will have an effect because of the
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
change to shall yes it will have an
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
effect and and that provision too is
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional you you have to have a
 
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.170 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional you you have to have a
hearing

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:38.180 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
uh to determine whether the person uh is
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
worthy of being detained preventively
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
preventatively be it at the front end
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
when the bail is first set or towards
 
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
later when there's an additional issue
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
raised uh there still needs to be a
 
00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
hearing with a clear and convincing uh
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
standard of proof for it to be
 
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:08.210 align:start position:0%
standard of proof for it to be
constitutional

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
could I ask just one quick thing that he
 
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
said about the the condition of bail
 
00:45:14.329 --> 00:45:14.339 align:start position:0%
just to get my
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
so you said that they have to have a
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
hearing to have due process yes it is
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
not that hearing in front of the bail
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner or whoever the judge is is
 
00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:26.579 align:start position:0%
that not a hearing and wouldn't that
 
00:45:26.579 --> 00:45:27.530 align:start position:0%
that not a hearing and wouldn't that
fulfill

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
fulfill
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
the uh the due process requirement
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
well if if the judge has no choice
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
if the word is shell there's not going
 
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative saley
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and as the daughter
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
of a law professor I understand the
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
verbosities my apologies to you um and
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
um so we we heard some testimony
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
um in the introduction of this bill that
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
talked about one potentially I guess one
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
might consider it an egregious case of
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
someone being released who maybe
 
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have prior to something
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious if there have been cases
 
00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:11.579 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that you're aware of
 
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
that would be egregious in the other
 
00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
direction such as the case of the young
 
00:46:17.809 --> 00:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
man who was held on Rikers Island in New
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
York for having stolen a backpack that
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
was valued at 25 and was held for three
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
years while he awaited trial because he
 
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
couldn't make the hundred dollars bail
 
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:28.930 align:start position:0%
couldn't make the hundred dollars bail
um

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:28.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:32.660 align:start position:0%
certainly there's such cases exist
 
00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:38.180 align:start position:0%
because uh inevitably if you know 37
 
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
of cases uh uh where bail is set 37
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
percent of them are being dismissed some
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
of them will involve people who are
 
00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.099 align:start position:0%
preventively detained
 
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
um I don't have
 
00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
in mind a specific case
 
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
in mind a specific case
um

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:59.329 --> 00:46:59.339 align:start position:0%
I'm old now so the memory fails me but
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
thank you if if you or your um student
 
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
assistant have the opportunity to just
 
00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
take a look to share any evidence of
 
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
anything later um that would be
 
00:47:14.569 --> 00:47:14.579 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you I'll make every
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
effort to get that kind of information
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee thank you
 
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
um one more question it occurs to me the
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
the case summary sheets that you on your
 
00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
um your assistant studied is it possible
 
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
that um a new arrest would be on a
 
00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:32.099 align:start position:0%
separate case sheet
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
in other words that goes yeah it's
 
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.329 align:start position:0%
in other words that goes yeah it's
possible

00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:35.339 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
um but if it were uh it's very possible
 
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to have a hearing
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
to hold this person because of the
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
subsequent arrest after being out on
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
bail they would and they would need to
 
00:47:59.809 --> 00:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
bring it up in that case
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
um so it's possible that
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
um the uh prosecutors uh
 
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
I think it's very possible that
 
00:48:13.329 --> 00:48:13.339 align:start position:0%
prosecutors understandably in many ways
 
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
they're not that closely monitoring
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
every single case they have they are
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
like the public defender system they are
 
00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
understaffed and they're overwhelmed
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
with cases uh and in the example that
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Newman talked about if
 
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
it's if they're out on PR bail on a
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and they could and they're
 
00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:38.099 align:start position:0%
arrested for another relatively minor
 
00:48:38.099 --> 00:48:39.550 align:start position:0%
arrested for another relatively minor
misdemeanor

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
prosecutors very likely not going to
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
notice that because he's now waking up
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
every morning coming into work and
 
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.849 align:start position:0%
every morning coming into work and
looking

00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
at every single case he has to see what
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
activity there would be
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
um so you know that's a
 
00:48:55.079 --> 00:48:57.230 align:start position:0%
um so you know that's a
um

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
they it's a matter of triage for lack of
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
a better way of putting it thank you
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
um I know with
 
00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
504 instances of people being actually
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
released on bail and not committing a
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
second offense
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
um that that's a pretty staggering
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
number that's over 99 percent
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
um but what I'm curious is the reason
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're all here today is because of that
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
other uh 0.79 of cases the four cases
 
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
where people did commit a second offense
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
while they were out on bail
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
I mean taking a look at those summary
 
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.390 align:start position:0%
I mean taking a look at those summary
sheets

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
sheets
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
um what sort of lessons can you glean uh
 
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
for police for prosecutors uh for was
 
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
there some sort of failure in the system
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
itself that we can address
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say the failure
 
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
I hate to use the word Phil it's a
 
00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
systemic failure in that there's not
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
enough prosecutors to follow up on each
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
case in which a person is released on
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
bail you know I think it is
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
um uh that's the fundamental
 
00:50:11.099 --> 00:50:12.470 align:start position:0%
um uh that's the fundamental
problem

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
if in fact a lot of people if a big if
 
00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
if in fact there's a lot more than the
 
00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
0.79 actually being arrested for
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
subsequent offenses after being released
 
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
on bail you know it's it it's hard to
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
say as much as I would like to say
 
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:36.260 align:start position:0%
you know only point you know over 99
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
Point what
 
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
99.2 percent of people released on bail
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
are not committing us are not being
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
arrested for additional offenses yeah we
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
can't say that with certainty because of
 
00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.589 align:start position:0%
can't say that with certainty because of
the

00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
the the the kind of data that is not
 
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.150 align:start position:0%
the the the kind of data that is not
available

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:50:59.650 --> 00:50:59.660 align:start position:0%
um but we you know it suggests to me
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
that prosecutors at the least
 
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
are not seeing a lot of people released
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
on bail committing serious enough
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
offenses to want to file a uh a motion
 
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
to revoke Baal we're just not seeing
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
that that is certainly the case why
 
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
they're not you know that's their
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
judgment again go back to what a prior
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
witness said humans administering a
 
00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.569 align:start position:0%
witness said humans administering a
system

00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
involving humans and and uh
 
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
I guess the ultimate lesson I would take
 
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
from this is
 
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.349 align:start position:0%
from this is
um

00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
we don't need to change the bail statute
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
the bail reform statute that was passed
 
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
four or five years ago we there is
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
plenty of flexibility to deal with all
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
the circumstances that have been raised
 
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
in testimony before this committee over
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
the last four or five years in efforts
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
to pull back on ballot reform the
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't exist now is completely
 
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
capable of dealing with all these
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
circumstances if the system is working
 
00:52:12.059 --> 00:52:13.430 align:start position:0%
circumstances if the system is working
well

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
we can't fix a poorly working system by
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
changing the statute it'll just make it
 
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.890 align:start position:0%
changing the statute it'll just make it
worse

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Frank Knack from
 
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee thank
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
you so much for the opportunity to
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
testify today my name is Frank kinack
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm the policy director with the ACLU of
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
um most of the um uh what I was planning
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
on discussing has already been touched
 
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
on by Professor sure and Mr Osteen so
 
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
I'll refer you to my my fact sheet for
 
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
additional background on on the those
 
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.569 align:start position:0%
additional background on on the those
issues

00:53:14.569 --> 00:53:14.579 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
um I want to touch on a couple of issues
 
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
that were raised by the prime sponsor
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
um I think one was this notion that we
 
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
are providing a special pass to poor
 
00:53:26.329 --> 00:53:26.339 align:start position:0%
people by eliminating going back to the
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
cash bail system that we had before by
 
00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
eliminating the protection against
 
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
um pre-trial incarceration for those who
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
can't afford it and I think it's just
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
really important to look at it this is
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
we are not creating special any type of
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
special paths to poor people we are
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
ensuring that people with wealth and
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
people with without wealth have the same
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for release that we are
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
making decisions based off of whether
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
someone should be detained based off of
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
dangerousness or Flight Risk and not how
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
much money they have in their bank
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
accounts which is what we would do if we
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
if we passed this law we would have
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
situations where person a with wealth
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
you know committed the same offense this
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
person be without wealth personally with
 
00:54:05.329 --> 00:54:05.339 align:start position:0%
with wealth would just be released
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
because they could pay for their bail
 
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
person B without wealth would just sit
 
00:54:10.849 --> 00:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
in jail and that's fundamentally unfair
 
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
and un-American
 
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:13.910 align:start position:0%
and un-American
um

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
I also want to touch on
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
um a few aspects that I think haven't
 
00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
been hit on today so one is the section
 
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
that would basically allow for uh
 
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.230 align:start position:0%
that would basically allow for uh
mandating

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
mandating
 
00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:29.099 align:start position:0%
pre-trial holds for people who are
 
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
rearrested for any offense again this is
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
any offense so includes Class B's that
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
are not jailable even if you're
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
convicted and given the maximum
 
00:54:38.569 --> 00:54:38.579 align:start position:0%
punishment as you heard from Professor
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
sure not only is it you know the fact
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't if you got convicted
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
and got the max punishment you wouldn't
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
be eligible for jail but a lot of these
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
folks will have their case dismissed and
 
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:47.630 align:start position:0%
folks will have their case dismissed and
so

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
um there there are not going to jail
 
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
anyway because they didn't do what was
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
alleged but under this bill you know
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
these folks can be held for up to six
 
00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
days and so I think as you all heard
 
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
from the clinical Professor last week
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
and testimony on SV or HP 318 you know
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
six day even one day of hold is a huge
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
burden on people you can pull them away
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
from their families and their their
 
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
family obligations if they have kids or
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
elderly parents who they're watching
 
00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:18.059 align:start position:0%
they can lose their job you know they're
 
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
taken away from education they're taking
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
away from Access to Health Care all
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
their responsibility all these and
 
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
that's one day this bill would allow for
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
up to six days and that's unconscionable
 
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:29.339 align:start position:0%
from our perspective I think it's really
 
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
also important to talk about the fact
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
that this bill is framed as a public
 
00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
safety bill when in fact it's actually
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
the opposite there's substantial
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
research that shows that pre-trial
 
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
incarceration is one of the worst things
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
we can do if we actually care about
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
public safety and because in fact of
 
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
what what you heard from the professor
 
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
last week that you're moving people from
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
their systems that you are making that
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
setting them up for failure and
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
additional hurdles when they are
 
00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:53.410 align:start position:0%
additional hurdles when they are
released

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:53.420 align:start position:0%
released
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
I point to a few studies in my fact
 
00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
sheet but one where they looked at over
 
00:56:01.609 --> 00:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
a 10-year period 1.5 million cases in
 
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
Kentucky and they found that holding
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
people for as little as 24 hours has a
 
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
net Public Safety harm because you're
 
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
removing people from their from their
 
00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:11.339 align:start position:0%
from their Sports systems you're taken
 
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:13.140 align:start position:0%
away from their jobs from their from
 
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
their families and so while we're not
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
saying that no one should be held we're
 
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
saying it should be based on individual
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
determinations on dangerousness by in
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
with the facts and case and not having
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
one size fits all approaches which this
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
bill would do
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
and just also reiterate the fact and
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see in in the handout I gave you
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
the Myriad ways under current law that
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
people can be held have their bail
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
revoked if they commit a new offense and
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
also which we have never heard um from
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
from proponents a response to is there's
 
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
also a section in current code that
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
allows prosecutors to challenge any
 
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
release order they disagree with and
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
I've never seen anyone bring that up a
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
case where that's come up and finally I
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
think we heard about this and I think
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative you had asked about
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
public safety and and crime stats and so
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
we thought it was important to actually
 
00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:04.140 align:start position:0%
look at what the data shows and so since
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
Bill reform was passed in 2018 between
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
2018 and 2021 which is the most current
 
00:57:11.569 --> 00:57:11.579 align:start position:0%
year of data available on the New
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of safety's website
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
crime in New Hampshire is down 18 for
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
group a crime so that is almost all
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
crimes all of the violent crimes in New
 
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire down 18 percent in Manchester
 
00:57:24.849 --> 00:57:24.859 align:start position:0%
what you've heard about is having
 
00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
alleged problems is time is down 13
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
percent since bail reform so the notion
 
00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
that somehow Borough form has made our
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
communities less safe is not backed up
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
by any data and so I'm not sitting here
 
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
saying that bail reform is the reason
 
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
that crime is down because then that
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
would also be disingenuous but the fact
 
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
that the other side is trying to spin it
 
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
um is just is troubling and happy to
 
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
um we during these hearings and there
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be several like them to
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
cover uh cover numerous bills um
 
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.030 align:start position:0%
cover uh cover numerous bills um
oh

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we
 
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we hear
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I lost my train of thought
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
I'll catch you afterwards
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it was going to be a very good
 
00:58:24.119 --> 00:58:25.309 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it was going to be a very good
question

00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
um it was going to be awesome I believe
 
00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:28.460 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
they're bringing all the questions thank
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you so much
 
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes attorney head
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:45.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
name is Richard head I'm the government
 
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
Affairs coordinator for the judicial
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
branch I wanted to focus on one part of
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
the this bill
 
00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.589 align:start position:0%
the this bill
um

00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
and only comment on on that part some
 
00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
beginning on page three
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
starting at line
 
00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.950 align:start position:0%
starting at line
2027

00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
2027
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
which makes a modification to existing
 
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
law and and there was some discussion
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
about it earlier that changes a May to a
 
00:59:13.799 --> 00:59:15.049 align:start position:0%
about it earlier that changes a May to a
shall

00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:15.059 align:start position:0%
shall
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
um in in that section
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
in in my comments are not with regard to
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
the policy behind it you've heard other
 
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
people speak to that but it's as to the
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
impact on the on the judicial branch and
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
what that means first I also just wanted
 
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.849 align:start position:0%
what that means first I also just wanted
to

00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
um sort of make clear what this section
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
relates to which is not just those who
 
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
are released on bail this is this
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
section when you read it talks about a
 
00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
person charged with an offense who is at
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
the time the offense was committed
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
and this is the list on release pending
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
trial for a felony or a misdemeanor
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
under federal or state law
 
00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.569 align:start position:0%
under federal or state law
release

00:59:52.569 --> 00:59:52.579 align:start position:0%
release
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
pending imposition or execution of the
 
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
sentence an appeal of the sentence or
 
01:00:00.849 --> 01:00:00.859 align:start position:0%
conviction or completion of the sentence
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
so from the from the time a person is
 
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
arrested on bail
 
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
through trial through or or settlement
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
through completion of sentence of that
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
crime if they are rearrested this
 
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:18.059 align:start position:0%
provision would kick in and the shall
 
01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:21.059 align:start position:0%
now applies to that large group of
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
people because it's all felonies and all
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors so it could be a
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor trespass
 
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
where they were they had some sort of a
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
sentence that lasted six months it may
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
have taken them close to eight nine
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
months to actually have trials so the
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
total period of time might be you know
 
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
close to a year and a half where this
 
01:00:45.049 --> 01:00:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
so what does that mean in terms of the
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
courts and and what are we currently
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with we have 40 and I'm going to
 
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
focus on Circuit Court
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
um uh not so much Superior Spears
 
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.950 align:start position:0%
um uh not so much Superior Spears
felonies

01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
felonies
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
um last session you passed the repeal of
 
01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:02.339 align:start position:0%
felonies first so all felonies beginning
 
01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
January 1 are going to start in the
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
circuit court so those bail decisions
 
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
are all going to be circuit court issues
 
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
If This Were to pass
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to talk about current
 
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
they're currently in in circuit court is
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
not just district with criminal Circuit
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
Court means District Division Family
 
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
Division probate Division and all of the
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
judges hear all of the cases
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
there are 42 full-time judges so up
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
until the vice chair returned back there
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
are 14 of you math was a little easier
 
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
you gave me a little extra person
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
if if we have 15 people here we have 42
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
judges it's a little less than three
 
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
times the group that's here hearing me
 
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
speak today so 42 full-time judges we
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
also have six part-time judges they
 
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
receive on average 127
 
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
000 cases a year it's a lot of cases
 
01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
that come through there we've also
 
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
recently completed what's called a
 
01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
weighted caseload study in uh in about a
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
minute the chief justice is going to
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
begin explaining that to division one
 
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
he's got two hours I'm hoping to take
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
about two more minutes of your time if
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
you do want to learn a lot about our
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
weighted caseload study he is I assume
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's being recorded and would be
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
available in talking in division one
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
if you take the the total number of
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
judges and you convert those into judge
 
01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
days so the number of J days a judge is
 
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
sitting and can sit and if you have 42
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
plus the six part-time and you assume
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
they don't take vacations they don't
 
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
take holidays off there are 249 session
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
days per judge so a judge sort of caps
 
01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
out at 249 session days per judge
 
01:02:47.569 --> 01:02:47.579 align:start position:0%
if we take those hundred and twenty
 
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
seven thousand cases
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
we need six a little over 16
 
01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
000 judge days so we have a little over
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
ten thousand we need current case load a
 
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
little over we have to be able to fill
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
16 000. that's why judges are rushing
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
some people
 
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
um so some of these hearings get sort of
 
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
pushed along they may have you know
 
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:12.299 align:start position:0%
needed a an hour they may have to they
 
01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
may only have a half hour you know some
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
of those are just getting pushed through
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
if we take another little subset in
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
everything that has a
 
01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:23.180 align:start position:0%
statutory deadline I'm not even counting
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional deadlines but if there's
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
a case that has a statutory deadline has
 
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299 align:start position:0%
to be heard within five days 10 days 14
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
days something like that that in and of
 
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
itself is 5 000 uh judge days so it's
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
about half of the total available judge
 
01:03:41.329 --> 01:03:41.339 align:start position:0%
days are just on those things that have
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
a statutory deadline so that's why you
 
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
might hear complaints about in my
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
divorce case took too long my small
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
claims case took too long
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
the things that have mandatory deadlines
 
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
have to get filled first constitutional
 
01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
deadlines have to get filled in we have
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
a little over ten thousand session days
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
available we need about sixteen thousand
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
that's why you're going to hear the the
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice asking for more judges in
 
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
the course of of uh of his budget
 
01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
presentation when he gives it
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
and really what we're talking about
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
though is so all of those bail hearings
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
have to go in front of a judge
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
um and those are Judges that are full
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
with what they already have a little bit
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
overflowing with what they already have
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
then you add in what is the impact on
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
staff because every one of these
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
cases that are coming in for a bail
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
requires a staff person to do all the
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
paperwork get that thing everything that
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
needs to be done to get that in front of
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
a judge
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
we like everybody else who runs a
 
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
business we have a short shortage and we
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
may actually may be doing a little
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
better than some maybe not um
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
the weighted caseload says that we need
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
338 Court staff throughout the system we
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
have 323 uh positions and we have about
 
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:07.140 align:start position:0%
40 35 vacancies so we're short even at
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
full capacity we're short the number of
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
Clerks we actually need and we're short
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
anyway because we can't actually fill
 
01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
all the positions
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
so then
 
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about when we're
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
talking about bail reform we're talking
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
about moving a case that doesn't need a
 
01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
bail Hearing in some and we're already
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
factoring in those cases that have bail
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
hearings so these are things that are
 
01:05:32.809 --> 01:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
not requiring a bail hearing they're
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
currently being decided by a bail
 
01:05:38.329 --> 01:05:38.339 align:start position:0%
commissioner or they're being issued as
 
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
summonses not as as an arrest warrant so
 
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:42.740 align:start position:0%
they don't come through the bail process
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
so a lot of misdemeanors would have that
 
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
we are talking about a very under just
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
that section I I pointed out to on page
 
01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.130 align:start position:0%
that section I I pointed out to on page
three

01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
a significant increase in load coming
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
into this system and that system doesn't
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
have capacity for additional load
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
if you add on to that and it's not
 
01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
factored into these numbers the repeal
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
of felonies first
 
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
everything that is currently starting in
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
Superior Court is going to shift into
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
circuit course so that 127 000 cases I
 
01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
talked about on average you have to add
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
another 10 000 cases because that's
 
01:06:22.329 --> 01:06:22.339 align:start position:0%
they're about ten thousand felony cases
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
in superior court filed and those are
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
getting shifted over already to this
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
appear in into the circuit court system
 
01:06:35.569 --> 01:06:35.579 align:start position:0%
might ask for this particular bill is
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
that that section be taken out and I've
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
spoken with a sponsor and I've indicated
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
that was going to be our ask on this
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
bill and that be incorporated if the if
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
as a policy matter you want to bring
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
that forward that would be put into the
 
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
other sort of bail reform that's talking
 
01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:52.690 align:start position:0%
other sort of bail reform that's talking
about

01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:52.700 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
things that require more bail decisions
 
01:06:58.609 --> 01:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
representative Barry's bill has
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
something similar to this but not
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
exactly this
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
but my only ask is is that this be
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
discussed in terms of the overall
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
capacity of the system to absorb the
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
additional workload that that these
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
types of additional bail hearings will
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
cause within the system
 
01:07:18.059 --> 01:07:18.890 align:start position:0%
cause within the system
um

01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
the weighted caseload study is just
 
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
completed last year it does have an
 
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:26.339 align:start position:0%
impact in terms of what we're what the
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
chief justice is asking for in terms of
 
01:07:30.609 --> 01:07:30.619 align:start position:0%
the court system budget request
 
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
and and it asks for more judges more
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
staff even if we get those there's going
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
to be a a sort of build up we have to
 
01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
absorb the current system with that and
 
01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:44.579 align:start position:0%
then add into anything adding anything
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
into it
 
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
is is the next step so we're just asking
 
01:07:53.089 --> 01:07:53.099 align:start position:0%
that it'd be that with regard to this
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
particular bill that portion which would
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
be page three beginning line 27 through
 
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:02.839 align:start position:0%
Page four line three
 
01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:05.339 align:start position:0%
be pulled out of this one and add it
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
into the other bills the only other and
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
my last comment would be is by
 
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
converting it from a May to a shell it
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
also assumes
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
everybody has knowledge at the time of
 
01:08:19.249 --> 01:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
rest and at the time of rest what this
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
bill would require is that the officer
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
have an understanding of what the status
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
is of that individual relative to any
 
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
prior crimes from bail through
 
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
completion of sentencing and and my
 
01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
understanding is that information is
 
01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:35.660 align:start position:0%
simply not there at the time of arrest
 
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:39.299 align:start position:0%
so it it raises at least concerns as to
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
what are the implications of that if if
 
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
the arresting officer unless they're
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
familiar with the individual they've
 
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
been in the in their community and
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
they're they're well aware of them uh or
 
01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.669 align:start position:0%
they're they're well aware of them uh or
[Music]

01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:52.679 --> 01:08:54.590 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
I don't have a I I think that just
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
requires a further development of an
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
understanding as to exactly what does a
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
police officer know and can they have
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
this knowledge and if not what is what
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
is going to be needed from a systems
 
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
wide basis to get that knowledge to
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
interesting officers so at that time
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
they can make an under a a an informed
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether or not any of
 
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
these criteria apply to the individual
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
in front of them so that they would go
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
through the right channels and with that
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
I would conclude my comments but I'd be
 
01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:30.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
thank you one of the things you did was
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
you're very clearly outlined how the
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
system would be overloaded
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I'd like to know a
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
little bit more about is what happens if
 
01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
we pass a bill like this and we overload
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
the system uh in the way that you talked
 
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
about what what are the practical
 
01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:54.299 align:start position:0%
consequences on the ground for people
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get Justice in New Hampshire
 
01:09:59.450 --> 01:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question the the
 
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
implication is that we triage so
 
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
everything in circuit court is done on a
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
on a triage basis so you know on any
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
particular day you have
 
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
um bail is is going to be a day so
 
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
Monday morning is is bail Monday
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
afternoon is Criminal throughout that
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
process you have domestic violence
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
petitions being filed you have
 
01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
um uh dcyf filing emergency petitions
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
those have to get addressed so those are
 
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
done on an emergency basis then you deal
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
with anything that has a a deadline that
 
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
the legislature has imposed into the
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
system so if it's uh a landlord tenant
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
case those have to get heard within I
 
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
think it's 14 days
 
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
you have the things that that require
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
sort of that are driven by a deadline
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
that's set by a statute or or outside of
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
that that you have the Constitutional
 
01:10:59.689 --> 01:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
deadlines of speedy trial and whatever
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
it may be so then you have
 
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
things that don't have those associated
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
um those simply don't get heard as
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
quickly so those get pulled in where
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity the small claims
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
cases the probate cases or at least the
 
01:11:16.199 --> 01:11:17.649 align:start position:0%
cases the probate cases or at least the
orders

01:11:17.649 --> 01:11:17.659 align:start position:0%
orders
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh marital cases whatever it may be that
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a strict deadline simply
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
get triaged later into the system
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's just a practical
 
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
reality they all get heard they'll in
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
and these judges do and and more
 
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
importantly Court staff are just doing a
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
remarkable amount of work and do it
 
01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
remarkably well uh and and do it in a
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
way that the system works but it is at
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
capacity and it's overflowing um so you
 
01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
do hear complaints about some stuff
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%

Hills 10.
 
01:12:50.689 --> 01:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
I am here to introduce
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
um the magistrate bill
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
that we've heard quite a bit about over
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
the last couple weeks
 
01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.189 align:start position:0%
the last couple weeks
um

01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
there are changes to the bill
 
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have an amendment
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
but at some point it's going to be
 
01:13:03.659 --> 01:13:05.450 align:start position:0%
but at some point it's going to be
introduced

01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
um by attorney head
 
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:09.169 align:start position:0%
um by attorney head
um

01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:09.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:11.300 align:start position:0%
but I want to read um
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
490k which is
 
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.209 align:start position:0%
490k which is
um

01:13:14.209 --> 01:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
definitely a definite change from the
 
01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
bill you might have received from
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
um earlier I think I did pass out some
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
another bill to you guys as well but I
 
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
um for 90k one appointments and
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
qualification the Chief Justice of the
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in consultation with the
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice of the superior court and
 
01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:41.219 align:start position:0%
the administrative judge of the Circuit
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
Court shall appoint magistrates in such
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
numbers as are necessary for the
 
01:13:48.649 --> 01:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
effective administration of justice
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
substitute subject to Appropriations by
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
the legislature such magistrates would
 
01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
serve as such locations as the Chief
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Supreme Court in
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
consultation with the Chief Justice of
 
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
the superior court and the
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the Circuit
 
01:14:07.090 --> 01:14:07.100 align:start position:0%
Court May determine under this chapter
 
01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
magistrates shall be judicial branch
 
01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:11.750 align:start position:0%
magistrates shall be judicial branch
employees

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
um I believe that's significant because
 
01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
what happens there is um the plan is to
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
develop a training and those magistrates
 
01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
that would be hired would actually
 
01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
report to a um
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
I think it's a director of magistrates
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
or someone that would be someone over
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
those magistrates
 
01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
another important piece of this bill is
 
01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
there was much complaint about holding
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
folks for 72 hours some for misdemeanors
 
01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:42.980 align:start position:0%
something that they wouldn't even be
 
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
held for prior to that
 
01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:47.050 align:start position:0%
held for prior to that
um

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:47.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
this would be a 24 7.
 
01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:52.729 align:start position:0%
this would be a 24 7.
um

01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:52.739 --> 01:14:54.229 align:start position:0%
um
offer

01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
you know because they would be 24 7. I
 
01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
think when we did the circle of course
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
we realized that with the cert hiring
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judges for example still
 
01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
meant that they were not there on the
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
weekend or holidays this is different
 
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the main reasons why I
 
01:15:12.649 --> 01:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
think this is a good build that was
 
01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
presented by the judicial Department
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
and I support it wholeheartedly and I
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
surely hope that everyone here would
 
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
support it as well and one of the other
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
things that came up um in terms of um
 
01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:28.100 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
bail being a being a Baler that you
 
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
could still
 
01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
um you can become a magistrate that's
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
not off limit to you and you do not have
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
to have a law degree so just want to
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
clear that up a little bit and I did
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
speak with um someone the last week
 
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
about that as well so you're gonna hear
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
a lot more testimony we've heard a lot
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
but you still more to be heard so I'm
 
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.310 align:start position:0%
but you still more to be heard so I'm
gonna

01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
say thank you for allowing me to
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
introduce and be a part of this bill
 
01:16:01.729 --> 01:16:01.739 align:start position:0%
I just if I could just ask you one
 
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
question this this would also allow for
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
a videotape failings would it not yes
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh good morning again just uh very
 
01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
quickly for the record David Rothstein
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
um here on behalf of uh nhacdl the New
 
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of criminal
 
01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:40.739 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers the association uh in
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
principle supports this bill
 
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
um it dovetails well with a lot of the
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
things that were were just discussed and
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
as I understand that the committee has
 
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
been discussing about bail
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
um in that we just heard uh from
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
attorney head that the system is highly
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
stressed in terms of resources that what
 
01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
we're going to be facing at the
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
beginning of 2024 in the circuit courts
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to go back to hearing a
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
lot more bail cases I I practiced uh
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
obviously before felonies first and the
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
circuit courts had to hear a felony bail
 
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
cases in the first instance rather than
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
the superior court so to the extent that
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
the bill can provide
 
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
um an an intelligent and focused
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
commitment of resources to allow the
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
courts to more uh to to more
 
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
economically efficiently and more
 
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
expertly address issues such as bail and
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
related issues such as issuing uh arrest
 
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
warrants and search warrants uh it
 
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
sounds like a good commitment of
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
resources I obviously in terms of
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
exactly how this works in terms of the
 
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
finances and the the policy behind it I
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
really can't speak to that but if you
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
were to create a system where you have a
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
magistrate who is well trained who is
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
well versed in the issues of bail who is
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
well-versed in the resources that are
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
available in the community
 
01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
um and and who knows the players and and
 
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
who can invest the time necessary to
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
make intelligent bail decisions it
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's promising as the court
 
01:18:24.169 --> 01:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
knows in the federal system there's a
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
magistrate that largely deals with bail
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
why largely deals with search warrants
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
and pre-trial issues and probable cause
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
issues and that magistrate develops an
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
expertise over time and that magistrate
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
the work that the magistrate does frees
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
up the judges to to be able to do other
 
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
work that's pressing on the system so
 
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
for those reasons at least in principle
 
01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
it sounds like a good bill just the
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
caveat being that you know you still
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
need to be properly trained and
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
resourced to make bail decisions just if
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
you're a lawyer it doesn't necessarily
 
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
mean you're going to make a better bail
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
decision than a bail commissioner the
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
person still needs to be trained but it
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
sounds like from the prior testimony
 
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a premium put on
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
training and supervision of the
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
magistrates to try to to get to the
 
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
right individualized decisions in each
 
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
case so the the organization nhacdl

thank you are there any questions no if
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
there are no questions thank you well
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and thank you
 
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
for having me uh for the record I am
 
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative Margaret dry from
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
Plainfield representing Sullivan County
 
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
district 7 Plainfield and Cornish
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
Newport unity in Charlestown I I'm
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
um two of my immediate constituents
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
nearby contacted me about this bill
 
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
because they are bail Commissioners and
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
so I've had extensive conversations with
 
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:10.910 align:start position:0%
so I've had extensive conversations with
them

01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
I know from personal experience the time
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
that it takes bail Commissioners to do
 
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
their duties in the state of New
 
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.130 align:start position:0%
their duties in the state of New
Hampshire

01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
in fact while I was talking to one bail
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner about this he was
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
interrupted with a call for his Services
 
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
up in Lebanon I also serve with him on
 
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
the volunteer rescue squad and I can't
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
tell you how many times he has either
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
been called out while we were you know
 
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
in service or it was coming back to or
 
01:20:40.330 --> 01:20:40.340 align:start position:0%
about to go to a a bail
 
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
commissioner duty of his uh it
 
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
emergencies medical emergencies don't go
 
01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
by nine by five calendar uh weekday
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
schedule and neither do the
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
opportunities for bail Commissioners to
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
be put into service and I just believe
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
that a small amount of magistrates at
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
the cost of about a million and a half
 
01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
dollars can never meet the
 
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
round-the-clock need that over a hundred
 
01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
essentially free bail Commissioners
 
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
already provide to the state
 
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
I think a better use of our money might
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
be to take them the money designed for
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
training in this bill and apply it to
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners that we already
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
have so I ask you to please vote this
 
01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.270 align:start position:0%
have so I ask you to please vote this
itl

01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for your Testament are there
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot of
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
um information about bail Commissioners
 
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
and the great job that they do and the
 
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
low cost that they do it with and and
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
all of the things that they have to put
 
01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
up with doing that job
 
01:21:50.699 --> 01:21:51.410 align:start position:0%
up with doing that job
um

01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious since you have
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
knowledge about that
 
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
um do you foresee that there could be a
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
a better
 
01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:04.030 align:start position:0%
a better
um

01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
solution for the problem that we
 
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
currently have with the bail
 
01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.290 align:start position:0%
currently have with the bail
commissioners

01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
and that would be more effective than it
 
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
is in cost less than this what exactly
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
would you say about that two problems
 
01:22:18.649 --> 01:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
came up thank you for your question two
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
problems came up when I discussed it
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
this is all new information to me as
 
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
well one of the problems is uh that the
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
fee that they get is minimal it's forty
 
01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
dollars but they have to collect that
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
themselves and a lot of time that is not
 
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
forthcoming so they're putting out the
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
service they're doing the job that we're
 
01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
expecting them to do and at all hours of
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
the day and night and they're not
 
01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
getting paid for it they really don't
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
have a recourse for that so A solution
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
for that might be just that the court
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
collects the
 
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
um the fee for them and pays them the
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
other is what I said before
 
01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:53.510 align:start position:0%
other is what I said before
um

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
training there's not training available
 
01:22:58.970 --> 01:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
it's it could be a lot better system of
 
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
training for these people and and then I
 
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
think those two would go a long way to
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
do you think that uh that would be able
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
to track enough people to to follow that
 
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
and do you think they would still I mean
 
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the fee is going to be
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
but I assume that the high cost for the
 
01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
magistrate is that the salary for that
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
is more is a lot more than you would
 
01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
collect off of any individual fees
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
so do you think we'd be able to attract
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
enough people to do that what is the
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
only solution if you want to use
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
magistrates to have
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
many as many as are needed to be able to
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
do it 24 7 because the proper resources
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
have been permitted
 
01:23:53.689 --> 01:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question what I
 
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
believe will happen is that you will
 
01:23:56.209 --> 01:23:56.219 align:start position:0%
retain the people that you already have
 
01:23:59.209 --> 01:23:59.219 align:start position:0%
and that's over a hundred people and and
 
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
I think if you solve the problems that
 
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
they're bringing up about being paid and
 
01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
about being trained then you might be
 
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
able to keep the force that we have
 
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's already in place and already
 
01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:11.030 align:start position:0%
that's already in place and already
experienced

01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
I I just have a question if the
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
if the fee that the bill if the person
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
is not paying the fees to the bill
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner and that money is put into
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
the court system to be collected as fees
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
and the person does not pay their fines
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
where would that money come from
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
well I just personally I thank you for
 
01:24:31.729 --> 01:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
your question I think that the the
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
judicial system has a little more
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
influence on on getting the forty
 
01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
dollars which is pretty minimal price
 
01:24:39.490 --> 01:24:39.500 align:start position:0%
um to to
 
01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
repay the Commissioners for their work
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh that they have more influence than
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners do as by evidence the
 
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
fact that they don't get paid and don't
 
01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
have a recourse to get it I think we can
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
work a way that we could transfer those
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
funds to them that that would be covered
 
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
they would be covered first and the
 
01:24:59.450 --> 01:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
judicial system would would just tack
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
that on to whatever expenses else they
 
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
have to be done I hope that if they
 
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
trained people and if you put a little
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
pressure on then maybe we could solve
 
01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
this problem without resorting to a real
 
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be shockingly brief
 
01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.729 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be shockingly brief
um

01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
over the last five years one of the most
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
common complaints we've heard uh from
 
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
the police and prosecutors is the
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
irregularity of the bail commissioner
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
system there are really good bail
 
01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and there are bail
 
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who
 
01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:01.550 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who
um

01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
are at least from the police perspective
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
not performing in a way that the police
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
think they should be
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill does uh is
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
regularized the system standardize the
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
system in a way that will have more
 
01:26:22.199 --> 01:26:24.830 align:start position:0%
system in a way that will have more
predictable

01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
predictable
 
01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.450 align:start position:0%
predictable
decisions

01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:26:30.970 --> 01:26:30.980 align:start position:0%
from the first person setting bail
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a good thing and I I
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
would emphasize that my understanding uh
 
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:40.139 align:start position:0%
from representative Harry gathright is
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
that you know uh people who are bail
 
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
Commissioners now can apply to would we
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
be able to apply to be magistrates so
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's not in it's not a lit we're getting
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
rid of the people who are now bail
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it it's creating a better
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
system and once again we're back with
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
the uh we uh with
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
um you know we need to put these this is
 
01:27:11.450 --> 01:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
a a very good allocation of resources to
 
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
improve the system
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
um I and I uh I know there is some
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
discussion of this when representative
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
Lynn presented his bill to add three
 
01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judges uh last week
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
if if this committee is not inclined to
 
01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.510 align:start position:0%
if if this committee is not inclined to
vote

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this bill uh which I
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
would urge them to do I think it would
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense to have a study
 
01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.370 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense to have a study
committee

01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
focused on this Staffing issue
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
magistrate bills
 
01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
magistrate judges uh bail commissioners
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
have a study committee where the
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
committee looks at or a commission looks
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
at the Lin Bill and Harriet gathwright's
 
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
bill I think that might make a lot of
 
01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:01.370 align:start position:0%
bill I think that might make a lot of
sense

01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative jandron
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for taking
 
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going back in history a little
 
01:28:11.209 --> 01:28:11.219 align:start position:0%
bit here uh I remember in my town we had
 
01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
a municipal court Municipal Court had as
 
01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
a magistrate a Justice of the Peace
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
and when the Municipal Court went away
 
01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:22.340 align:start position:0%
which heard
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
bail hearings before they went to the
 
01:28:26.689 --> 01:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
district court which is now part of the
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
circuit court system
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
they actually heard those please and set
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
bail at the municipal court level now
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
the Municipal Court
 
01:28:42.129 --> 01:28:42.139 align:start position:0%
Justice was a Justice of the Peace
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
our bail Commissioners now are
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
justices of the Peace So
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
the the person that testified just prior
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
to you uh said the money that is
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill
 
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh is better spent
 
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
on training for our justices of the
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
peace slash bail Commissioners would you
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
agree or disagree with that uh I
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
disagree I I you know I uh one not all
 
01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
justices of the peace are bail
 
01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.490 align:start position:0%
justices of the peace are bail
commissioners

01:29:13.490 --> 01:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
I think this makes the magistrate judges
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
full-time employees of the court system
 
01:29:28.729 --> 01:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot more that will in to
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
get a lot more supervision
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
what's the right word they'll be uh more
 
01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
uniform hiring practices
 
01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
and I think you will be certain that
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
you'll always get have a Magistrate
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
Judge there to manage the incoming cases
 
01:29:57.649 --> 01:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
I know depending on where you are in the
 
01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
state it sometimes can be very difficult
 
01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
to get magistrate judges so I I'm I'm an
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
advocate of more formally folding
 
01:30:07.199 --> 01:30:08.090 align:start position:0%
advocate of more formally folding
uh

01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
the tasks that bail Commissioners do
 
01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:14.219 align:start position:0%
into the court system on a full-time
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
basis you know at a at a certain point
 
01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative general you know it
 
01:30:24.649 --> 01:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
becomes uh what do you call it
 
01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
um you know do you do you keep bail
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and just
 
01:30:31.729 --> 01:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
put the word bail commissioner in this
 
01:30:33.770 --> 01:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
instead of Magistrate Judge but still do
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
everything else this bill bill does you
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
know it's unclear when that's really
 
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
what we're doing or not doing out of
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
curiosity what Municipal Court were you
 
01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
my hometown of Seabrook
 
01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
I appeared in that Municipal Court
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.169 --> 01:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you thank
 
01:30:57.179 --> 01:30:59.590 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you thank
you

01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.689 --> 01:31:13.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Rose and good
 
01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:18.290 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Rose and good
morning

01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:19.729 align:start position:0%
morning
committee

01:31:19.729 --> 01:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:21.719 align:start position:0%
all right I am Thomas Anderson I am a
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner I live in francestown
 
01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
and I work primarily in the Goffstown
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
and Hillsborough district courts and the
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County North Superior Court
 
01:31:33.719 --> 01:31:36.229 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County North Superior Court
uh

01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
I think you I'm not going to bore you
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
with what we do because you all know
 
01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to know how we do
 
01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:46.250 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to know how we do
it

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
and while
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
remote Bales are in some cases necessary
 
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not a proponent of that
 
01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
my view is
 
01:31:58.610 --> 01:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's important to the police it's
 
01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
important to the defendant if we have a
 
01:32:02.689 --> 01:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
face-to-face meeting in order to
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
establish whether or not you're going to
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
be released
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
and so my view is my personal view is if
 
01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
I get a call at two o'clock in the
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
morning as I usually do I will drive to
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
whoever calls me
 
01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
because I think it's important
 
01:32:20.689 --> 01:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.010 --> 01:32:24.020 align:start position:0%
in some cases remote Bales may be
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate if you're talking about a
 
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
warrant for say a traffic violation or
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
actually a traffic violation
 
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
but getting back to my point about
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
making personal appearances anything
 
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
that involves domestic violence or
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
driving under the influence
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
my personal view is I will appear in
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
person to make a determination as to
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not the defendant is under
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
01:32:47.639 --> 01:32:49.129 align:start position:0%
the statute
dangerous

01:32:49.129 --> 01:32:49.139 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I use essentially four criteria in
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases
 
01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:55.430 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases
one

01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
was the victim significantly injured two
 
01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
was a weapon involved
 
01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.510 align:start position:0%
was a weapon involved
three

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
was the defendant resisting arrest
 
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
violently and four is their intoxication
 
01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:09.950 align:start position:0%
violently and four is their intoxication
involved

01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
it all factors into my view face to face
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
with a defendant as to whether or not
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
that person is is dangerous
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
and I think in making that determination
 
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
remember the victim has rights as well
 
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
as the defendant
 
01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
and I can issue a criminal bail
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
protective order
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
which tells the defendant you can't have
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
contact with the victim you can't go
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
back to where the offense took place
 
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
but keep in mind that's a piece of paper
 
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
and if I think that the defendant is
 
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
going to reoffend that night and go back
 
01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:51.050 align:start position:0%
going to reoffend that night and go back
and

01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:54.110 --> 01:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
revisit the victim then I'm going to
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
place that person in custody
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
a simple choice
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
when I look at this bill pardon me while
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
if I can get a clarification from the
 
01:34:12.239 --> 01:34:14.350 align:start position:0%
if I can get a clarification from the
chair

01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:18.500 align:start position:0%
is Roman numeral two in 490 K1
 
01:34:20.450 --> 01:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
conducting arraignment hearings and
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
issued decisions on arraignments is that
 
01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
no longer applicable
 
01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:27.980 align:start position:0%
because the bill has been amended
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing here is is how is how
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
it would read from here anything that is
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
if you look on the next page on line 13
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
do you see where that's crossed off
 
01:34:41.209 --> 01:34:41.219 align:start position:0%
that would be what is taken out am I
 
01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay so I sorry I believe I answered
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
that question correctly so what you're
 
01:34:57.169 --> 01:34:57.179 align:start position:0%
what you're reading under you know 490k
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
this is this is how the law would read
 
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
and then as an example if you look over
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
at the next page on line 13 it says if a
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
person is ordered release and then where
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's crossed off by a bill commissioner
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then it says on bail that is how the
 
01:35:12.169 --> 01:35:12.179 align:start position:0%
new how the new
 
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
amended RSA would read
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
so if I understand the purpose of the
 
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
bill you want to or the bill wants to
 
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
replace a hundred bail Commissioners or
 
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
so who work at no cost to the government
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
with 15 magistrates who are going to
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
essentially support 11
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts
 
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
tangs circuits with 34 district courts
 
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
and 200 or so police departments
 
01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's going to work and I
 
01:35:53.090 --> 01:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
don't think so because again looking at
 
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:57.179 align:start position:0%
the magistrate would fix the amount of
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
bail on all days of the week and at all
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
times of the day and I'm going back to
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
my point of
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
are we going to be doing remote Bales is
 
01:36:06.169 --> 01:36:06.179 align:start position:0%
the mattress we're going to be doing
 
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
remote Bales and if so
 
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
how does that Advance the ball
 
01:36:13.729 --> 01:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
if you're dealing with somebody who was
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
arrested for DUI or domestic violence
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
and you're doing
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
the bail assessment remotely I don't
 
01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
think that advances the ball at all I
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
think that's dangerous
 
01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
and so basically on that point you know
 
01:36:30.169 --> 01:36:30.179 align:start position:0%
we're all volunteers
 
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
basically we get a fee if it's paid
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're volunteers but then you know that
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
because you're all volunteers
 
01:36:36.719 --> 01:36:38.030 align:start position:0%
because you're all volunteers
essentially

01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
and this whole state runs on volunteers
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
I've been a member of a number of boards
 
01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
and committees in my hometown
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
and I understand you can't run enough
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
you you can't operate without volunteers
 
01:36:52.679 --> 01:36:54.890 align:start position:0%
you you can't operate without volunteers
and

01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
in this environment
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
because things are so expensive and
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
costs are going up it's important to
 
01:37:04.689 --> 01:37:04.699 align:start position:0%
keep your volunteers
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:37:10.729 --> 01:37:10.739 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
representative breed
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:17.030 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
question

01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
so they spoke to
 
01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:21.179 align:start position:0%
Commissioners bail Commissioners being
 
01:37:23.110 --> 01:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
able to become
 
01:37:25.570 --> 01:37:25.580 align:start position:0%
magistrates and
 
01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
employees of the state do you think that
 
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
how do you think the bail Commissioners
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
feel about that and do you think more
 
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
training and the fees being paid with
 
01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
the court fines do those three things do
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
you how do you think the bail
 
01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
Commissioners feel about that would feel
 
01:37:46.729 --> 01:37:46.739 align:start position:0%
about that thank you for your question
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
for your testimony well I'd be reluctant
 
01:37:51.649 --> 01:37:51.659 align:start position:0%
to comment on what other bail
 
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
Commissioners feel about I can tell you
 
01:37:55.129 --> 01:37:55.139 align:start position:0%
how I feel about it and I don't think
 
01:37:57.890 --> 01:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
that again it doesn't Advance the ball
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
if you look at the at the bill the first
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
six Roman numerals
 
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
the mattress is going to fix bail on all
 
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
days of the week at all times that's
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
what a bail commissioner does
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to conduct bail hearings on
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
issues on bail and decisions regarding
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
release that's what bail Commissioners
 
01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.490 align:start position:0%
release that's what bail Commissioners
do

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
issue a risk arrest warrants or other
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
processes of arrest while we don't do
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
that regularly justices of the peace can
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
sign arrest warrants and search warrants
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
and administer Oaths and affirmations
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
so everything that's listed in this bill
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
to empower magistrates is what bail
 
01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
Commissioners do already
 
01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:38.510 align:start position:0%
Commissioners do already
so

01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
I you know I don't see where it's it
 
01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
changes anything
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that answers the
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.719 --> 01:38:49.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think that I'm training
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
um follow-up
 
01:38:54.239 --> 01:38:55.250 align:start position:0%
um follow-up
um

01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
do you think training would how do do
 
01:38:59.930 --> 01:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
the commissioners
 
01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
would they want more training a more
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
standard training program would that be
 
01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:07.129 align:start position:0%
standard training program would that be
helpful

01:39:07.129 --> 01:39:07.139 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you well training is always good
 
01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
but remember the bail Commissioners are
 
01:39:16.129 --> 01:39:16.139 align:start position:0%
Guided by the bail commissioner handbook
 
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
which is available online
 
01:39:20.689 --> 01:39:20.699 align:start position:0%
it's issued by the administrative office
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
of the courts and it's specifically
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
outlines what bail Commissioners can do
 
01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
and what they can't do
 
01:39:29.149 --> 01:39:29.159 align:start position:0%
and so just by looking at the bail
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner handbook you pretty much
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
get an idea of how the whole system
 
01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.010 align:start position:0%
get an idea of how the whole system
works

01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
the courts meet with us once a year
 
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
they explain to us any changes that we
 
01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
need to to understand or what changes
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
have been made
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
what we need to do what we need to know
 
01:39:48.890 --> 01:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
to do the job
 
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
um beyond that I'm not sure how a
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
training program would be designed
 
01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
to do more than that I mean I really
 
01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:57.950 align:start position:0%
to do more than that I mean I really
don't

01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:58.729 align:start position:0%
don't
um

01:39:58.729 --> 01:39:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
this is this is a bail commissioner's
 
01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.149 align:start position:0%
this is this is a bail commissioner's
work

01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
on experience
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
and I think the majority of bail
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that you see in the state
 
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
have been doing it for a long time
 
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
a fairly good knowledge of what they're
 
01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.129 align:start position:0%
a fairly good knowledge of what they're
doing

01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh I will concede that there are
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
probably bail Commissioners that don't
 
01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.490 align:start position:0%
probably bail Commissioners that don't
do

01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:40:24.649 --> 01:40:24.659 align:start position:0%
a good job
 
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
but again the police departments know
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
what bail Commissioners are available
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
and as I've explained on numerous times
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
especially in Goffstown
 
01:40:39.169 --> 01:40:39.179 align:start position:0%
I live in France's town I'm not in
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
Goffstown I'm 45 minutes away for at
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
least at least 40 minutes away from
 
01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:44.330 align:start position:0%
least at least 40 minutes away from
Goffstown

01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
Goffstown
 
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
but I have told the Goffstown police if
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
you call me at three o'clock in the
 
01:40:48.719 --> 01:40:50.450 align:start position:0%
you call me at three o'clock in the
morning

01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
I know that you have probably called all
 
01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
the other bail Commissioners that are
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
available in Goffstown and been
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful if you call me then I know
 
01:41:01.490 --> 01:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
that that's what you've done if I answer
 
01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
the phone and I'm available I'll respond
 
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
simple as that and they know that
 
01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
the other police departments the same
 
01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:10.250 align:start position:0%
the other police departments the same
thing

01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:41:12.169 --> 01:41:12.179 align:start position:0%
if they call me and I answer the phone
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm available if I'm there if
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm home they know that I will respond
 
01:41:20.209 --> 01:41:20.219 align:start position:0%
now I can't speak to the reliability of
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
other bail commissioners because they're
 
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
not me I can only tell you what I do
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
and I do this you know why do I do this
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's a I don't want to say it's a hoot
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
you meet interesting people
 
01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
and I like that I like to talk to people
 
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
like the face-to-face
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
and I realize that this is important to
 
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
the defendant they you know
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's a moment in time that they want to
 
01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.370 align:start position:0%
it's a moment in time that they want to
forget

01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
forget
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
I try to make it as pleasant as I can
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
for him but again I got to decide what
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
to do with them
 
01:41:54.890 --> 01:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
and for the most part
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to be released on PR
 
01:41:59.209 --> 01:41:59.219 align:start position:0%
because for the most part it's going to
 
01:42:01.330 --> 01:42:01.340 align:start position:0%
be traffic violations
 
01:42:04.609 --> 01:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
minor warrants Petty crimes situations
 
01:42:06.890 --> 01:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
except for DDS
 
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I carve out DVS as an exception I
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
treat DVS completely differently and I
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
explain to you why I do that
 
01:42:14.639 --> 01:42:15.770 align:start position:0%
explain to you why I do that
um

01:42:15.770 --> 01:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
my concern with the Magistrate
 
01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
position is
 
01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
you know Bill commissioner has been
 
01:42:24.649 --> 01:42:24.659 align:start position:0%
around for a long time
 
01:42:27.169 --> 01:42:27.179 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at the statute
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
turn of the before the turn of the 20th
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
century they were appointed by Superior
 
01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
Court and you know in the mid 60s there
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
was a district court
 
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
and I think primarily because no judge
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
wants to be awakened at three in the
 
01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:40.729 align:start position:0%
wants to be awakened at three in the
morning

01:42:40.729 --> 01:42:40.739 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
to set bail on somebody that's charged
 
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
with a petty offense they just don't
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
want to do that
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't blame them
 
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
so let's designate somebody else to do
 
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
it an intermediary to do it which is why
 
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
we are here that's why we were created
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
to make it a magistrate and pay you know
 
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
the the the rate that you intend to pay
 
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
the magistrates
 
01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
I don't think really
 
01:43:08.209 --> 01:43:08.219 align:start position:0%
improves the system at all I think it's
 
01:43:12.410 --> 01:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
it exorbitant cost for a function that
 
01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
already exists and in my mind works well
 
01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:20.699 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you
 
01:43:20.699 --> 01:43:21.590 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you
um

01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:23.689 --> 01:43:23.699 align:start position:0%
I have a question if you can answer it
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
when you
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
go to bail someone
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
are you aware of whether or not they're
 
01:43:32.689 --> 01:43:32.699 align:start position:0%
already bailed from somewhere else in
 
01:43:33.649 --> 01:43:33.659 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:43:35.930 --> 01:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh not necessarily
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
how would you find that out uh I have to
 
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
rely on the police to tell me that now
 
01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:44.699 align:start position:0%
I can look at the criminal record which
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
is what I do routinely
 
01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
the police will provide me with a
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
criminal record
 
01:43:53.209 --> 01:43:53.219 align:start position:0%
if based on the record I can deduce that
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
there is an outstanding
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
matter pending in some Court
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
I can try and re and research that but
 
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
remember at three o'clock in the morning
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
nobody's answering the phone on the
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
district courts
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
so I have to take a guess
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
depending on what the violation listed
 
01:44:19.450 --> 01:44:19.460 align:start position:0%
on the record is
 
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
that's going to influence how I think
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
But to answer your question I don't know
 
01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
you know I don't necessarily know if
 
01:44:29.689 --> 01:44:29.699 align:start position:0%
somebody's out on bail thank you
 
01:44:37.689 --> 01:44:37.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:44:43.729 --> 01:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
my question we've heard a lot today
 
01:44:45.649 --> 01:44:45.659 align:start position:0%
about bail Commissioners not being able
 
01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
to receive the fee
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
um from an offender when they're
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
conducting a hearing and I was just
 
01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could explain to us
 
01:44:55.609 --> 01:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
your experiences and you know trying to
 
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
collect the fee like what happens if
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
you're trying to collect the fee the
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
person says no what do you do from there
 
01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.830 align:start position:0%
person says no what do you do from there
like

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
shooting myself in the head for getting
 
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
up at three in the morning to hear that
 
01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:14.870 align:start position:0%
up at three in the morning to hear that
uh

01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
the the default rate for bail
 
01:45:21.050 --> 01:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
Commissioners varies by District
 
01:45:23.689 --> 01:45:23.699 align:start position:0%
now my default rate over five years and
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
my default rate I Define as somebody
 
01:45:29.149 --> 01:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
that doesn't pay me up front or doesn't
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
pay the court on the back end
 
01:45:35.209 --> 01:45:35.219 align:start position:0%
is about twenty percent two out of ten
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
I look at that as you know that's part
 
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
of the job
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
I signed up for this if I don't get paid
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's the risk I take do I like it no
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
do I deal with it yes and you know as I
 
01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
explained several years ago to
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
another legislator
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
you know I think I live in a in an area
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
where the
 
01:46:04.609 --> 01:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
the quality of the criminal is a lot
 
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
higher than it is normally in in
 
01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:07.850 align:start position:0%
higher than it is normally in in
Manchester

01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
you know in Manchester
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
they know the drill that the defendants
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
know the drill they know that they're
 
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
going to be released whether they pay
 
01:46:18.290 --> 01:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
the fee or not
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
I like to think the people I deal with
 
01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
they're a little bit more responsible
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
and that they will essentially pay the
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
fee at some point
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
to answer your question
 
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
you know I'm going to show out no matter
 
01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:32.810 align:start position:0%
you know I'm going to show out no matter
what

01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
and if they pay me that's great I feel
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
I go home
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
01:46:42.719 --> 01:46:44.090 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
morning

01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
um as you said earlier you and I are
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
both volunteers
 
01:46:56.450 --> 01:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
you're probably a much better volunteer
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
than I am not only for the what you do
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
about getting up in the middle of the
 
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
night and your dedication to providing
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
your service
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
but we get uh you know we get mileage
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
and we get a transponder so there are
 
01:47:13.490 --> 01:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
some of that so I'm just trying to make
 
01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
the case between the difference between
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
the two of us would it would it help for
 
01:47:18.719 --> 01:47:19.490 align:start position:0%
the two of us would it would it help for
um

01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
for the bail Commissioners if if perhaps
 
01:47:24.649 --> 01:47:24.659 align:start position:0%
they were even paid mileage by the by
 
01:47:26.930 --> 01:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
this system more a small stipend or
 
01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
anything is that does that have any
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
bearing on your
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking about trying to get new
 
01:47:33.890 --> 01:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners to replace all the
 
01:47:35.570 --> 01:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
people that are doing all that
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
what are you doing now
 
01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:38.930 align:start position:0%
what are you doing now
well

01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
to answer the first part of your
 
01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:41.570 align:start position:0%
to answer the first part of your
question

01:47:41.570 --> 01:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
any money would be great
 
01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
but the second part is while mileage
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
a mileage reimbursement would be nice
 
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh from an operational standpoint it's
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:59.689 --> 01:47:59.699 align:start position:0%
I guess if you say you know it takes
 
01:48:02.450 --> 01:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
it's 17 miles from my house to the
 
01:48:04.490 --> 01:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
Goffstown and back okay
 
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
but then how do you build that how do
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
you how do you recover that from the
 
01:48:11.570 --> 01:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
court uh yeah it becomes a sort of a
 
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
paperwork nightmare
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
the fee the 40 fee if if that were
 
01:48:21.169 --> 01:48:21.179 align:start position:0%
increased to cover the cost
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
it all sort of works out in the end I
 
01:48:25.729 --> 01:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
think that okay
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
gosh down 17 miles away Hillsborough is
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
10 miles away you know it all works out
 
01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
in the end
 
01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:34.679 align:start position:0%
but trying to build for mileage I think
 
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
would be you know
 
01:48:39.649 --> 01:48:39.659 align:start position:0%
a bureaucratic nightmare in terms of
 
01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
trying to get it through the courts and
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
figure that all out so
 
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
I guess to answer your question would it
 
01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:47.330 align:start position:0%
I guess to answer your question would it
work

01:48:47.330 --> 01:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
probably not is it a good idea oh of
 
01:48:52.490 --> 01:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
course I love it
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chair membership committee thank you
 
01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity my name is Frank
 
01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU New
 
01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:32.810 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU New
Hampshire

01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
um again uh much of what I was going to
 
01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
say Professor sure already touched on so
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'll just uh note one aspect of of why
 
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
we support this legislation and that's
 
01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
so the the debate we've heard around
 
01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
Bell reform over the last couple of
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
years including
 
01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
um this session
 
01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
is that we have people who are not
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
trained judges making important
 
01:49:54.410 --> 01:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
decisions about whether or not someone
 
01:49:56.930 --> 01:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
should be released and that we need to
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that its judges making those
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
decisions who are trained who are
 
01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:02.699 align:start position:0%
accountable to the Judiciary and so this
 
01:50:04.609 --> 01:50:04.619 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for us to address that
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
concern that's been raised without
 
01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
undermining people's Liberty which all
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
the other legislation before this body
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
would do and I just really want to point
 
01:50:15.530 --> 01:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
out the fact that if you look at um HB
 
01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
38 which which you heard earlier today
 
01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
or HB 318 which you all heard last week
 
01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
um in this bill they all have the same
 
01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
core issue that they're trying to
 
01:50:26.090 --> 01:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
address and that is they're trying to
 
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
make sure that people get before a judge
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
um uh to determine so that it's a judge
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
making that decision the difference
 
01:50:34.729 --> 01:50:34.739 align:start position:0%
between this bill and those other bills
 
01:50:36.590 --> 01:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
is those other bills require you to be
 
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
pre-trial detained for up to seven to
 
01:50:41.209 --> 01:50:41.219 align:start position:0%
eight or six days this bill ensures that
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
you're getting before a judge
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
immediately and we think that's
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
important particularly as we heard you
 
01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
know a large proportion of these
 
01:50:49.129 --> 01:50:49.139 align:start position:0%
occasions up I think it was around a
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
third that charges will be dismissed and
 
01:50:55.129 --> 01:50:55.139 align:start position:0%
so ensuring that folks if we really care
 
01:50:57.649 --> 01:50:57.659 align:start position:0%
about getting people before a judge and
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
that's what's important here this is our
 
01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that in a way that
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
does not undermine Liberty I also
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
understand that because particularly
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
because of felonies first the courts are
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed right now and so ensuring
 
01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
that we have a process that is without
 
01:51:16.129 --> 01:51:16.139 align:start position:0%
hiccups particularly around an issue
 
01:51:18.770 --> 01:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
like bail it may be better to have this
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
as a study and my understanding is that
 
01:51:22.729 --> 01:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
the court would support that and so if
 
01:51:24.169 --> 01:51:24.179 align:start position:0%
that would be the will that's something
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
we would also support and we'd be happy
 
01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
to help in any way but again this is
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
about ensuring that people are not
 
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
deprived of the liberty and that's what
 
01:51:33.010 --> 01:51:33.020 align:start position:0%
we all care about
 
01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily then this is the solution
 
01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
that addresses that core problem thank
 
01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:40.189 align:start position:0%
that addresses that core problem thank
you

01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you

good morning my name is Trixie Lafave
 
01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:09.179 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for allowing me to
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
attend this morning I'm a resident of
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
Londonderry I'm a bail commissioner my
 
01:52:15.530 --> 01:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
first nine years as a bail commissioner
 
01:52:18.290 --> 01:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
served for the dairy Circuit Court which
 
01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
would have been Dairy Londonderry
 
01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
Sandown Chester I have now moved my way
 
01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
up to the Manchester police department
 
01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
and work for them exclusively although
 
01:52:29.570 --> 01:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
if my local police departments are in
 
01:52:31.129 --> 01:52:31.139 align:start position:0%
need and they have not been able to find
 
01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner I do respond to them
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
when they call me
 
01:52:37.609 --> 01:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
um there was a suggestion that our
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
courts are highly stressed at this time
 
01:52:42.890 --> 01:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
because of a lack of Staffing
 
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
so if you reduce the workforce by 85
 
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
percent by letting go all of the bail
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and bring on 15
 
01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:52.910 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and bring on 15
magistrates

01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
magistrates
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
that is not going to alleviate any of
 
01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
the stress with the courts
 
01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:59.149 align:start position:0%
the stress with the courts
um

01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
the magistrates are at about a hundred
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
and five thousand dollars per year it's
 
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:06.659 align:start position:0%
zero dollars to the taxpayer for a bail
 
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner and that's a significant
 
01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
tax impact to our taxpayers
 
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
there was a question about mileage and
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
last year men some of you were members
 
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
of this committee last year when a
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
mileage bill was presented and there was
 
01:53:25.850 --> 01:53:25.860 align:start position:0%
a contingency of bail Commissioners that
 
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
came before the committee and asked not
 
01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
to support that mileage because it would
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
drive up a fiscal note for us as we have
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
been trying us meaning the community
 
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
four years we've been trying to get the
 
01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
legislation the legislatures to help us
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
with enforcement of our forty dollar fee
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
in 2021 there was a house bill that was
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
defeated because it had a six hundred
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar tax impact or fiscal
 
01:53:56.689 --> 01:53:56.699 align:start position:0%
note attached to it so we didn't want
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
mileage attached because it drives up a
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note so we're trying to fix the
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
problem but we don't want to raise the
 
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
cost until we can actually fix the
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
problem at the present fiscal rate so
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's why we have not asked for mileage
 
01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.870 align:start position:0%
that's why we have not asked for mileage
again

01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
but the question came up about
 
01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:17.689 align:start position:0%
but the question came up about
supervision

01:54:17.689 --> 01:54:17.699 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
that the magistrates would be directly
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
supervised by a position within the
 
01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:24.410 align:start position:0%
supervised by a position within the
courts

01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners are directly
 
01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
supervised by their circuit court judge
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
in their Superior Court judge so we have
 
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
two direct supervisors there is an
 
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
average of anywhere from one bail
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner per Court to five or six
 
01:54:41.209 --> 01:54:41.219 align:start position:0%
Manchester has six or so bail
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that is far better odds of
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
direct supervision than one
 
01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
magistrate supervising 15 magistrates
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
we work 24 7. the suggestion is the
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
magistrates would work 24 7. I was at
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
the Manchester Police Department six
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
o'clock Sunday evening and I was there
 
01:55:04.129 --> 01:55:04.139 align:start position:0%
until 11 30. that's one bail
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner out of the 100 that we have
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do if you have to
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
take one magistrate that's working for
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
the weekend how many you have for the
 
01:55:14.450 --> 01:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
weekend I don't know responding to Just
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
One Police Department
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
it just isn't going to work we do
 
01:55:23.689 --> 01:55:23.699 align:start position:0%
we really do appreciate the fact that
 
01:55:25.629 --> 01:55:25.639 align:start position:0%
the there's a
 
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
conversation in here about additional
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
education we welcome it more than one
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
hour per year in September October would
 
01:55:37.129 --> 01:55:37.139 align:start position:0%
be welcomed to the bail commissioner
 
01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
Community having something other than
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
our handbook would be appreciated but we
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
also do have direct contact if I have a
 
01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
question or a concern I can reach out to
 
01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
my clerk who then reaches out to my
 
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
judge and we have a one-on-one via email
 
01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:50.590 align:start position:0%
judge and we have a one-on-one via email
usually

01:55:50.590 --> 01:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
usually
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
so if this bill were to pass by just
 
01:55:56.689 --> 01:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
removing the word magistrate and
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
continuing and put the word bail
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner back in there there would
 
01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
be no fiscal impact to the state and we
 
01:56:04.129 --> 01:56:04.139 align:start position:0%
would still be continuing to do the job
 
01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
that we have been doing since the 60s
 
01:56:11.689 --> 01:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
so that is my commentary for today and I
 
01:56:13.370 --> 01:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
just um I oppose this villain I would
 
01:56:15.169 --> 01:56:15.179 align:start position:0%
like the committee to give it more
 
01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
serious thought before they make their
 
01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:21.709 align:start position:0%
serious thought before they make their
judgment

01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
and the chair calls uh turning head from
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
01:56:39.649 --> 01:56:39.659 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
01:56:41.330 --> 01:56:41.340 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:42.350 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
um

01:56:42.350 --> 01:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:44.689 --> 01:56:44.699 align:start position:0%
this bill sort of originated last
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
session I think in
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh in our 10 in my testimony relative to
 
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
bail reform bills that were being
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
proposed last session
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
um as a way of offsetting some of the
 
01:56:57.649 --> 01:56:57.659 align:start position:0%
burden that Eve those bills were to have
 
01:56:59.689 --> 01:56:59.699 align:start position:0%
passed would have been put on to the
 
01:57:01.609 --> 01:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
circuit court judge system and I already
 
01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
described that I won't repeat it again
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
one of the other aspects of this and I
 
01:57:10.729 --> 01:57:10.739 align:start position:0%
did briefly mention it is is in last
 
01:57:12.649 --> 01:57:12.659 align:start position:0%
session there was the repeal of felonies
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
first which is moving all the felonies
 
01:57:17.649 --> 01:57:17.659 align:start position:0%
into Circuit Court the administrative
 
01:57:21.169 --> 01:57:21.179 align:start position:0%
burden that that that has created has
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
been significant I can't overemphasize
 
01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
just how significant this effort is to
 
01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
just set up and and put this system back
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
into place
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:36.659 align:start position:0%
while we think this bill is a good is a
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
good idea it does
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
warrant further study and further
 
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.790 align:start position:0%
warrant further study and further
evaluation

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
um and and as I mentioned last week with
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
regard to representative Lynn's Bill we
 
01:57:48.119 --> 01:57:48.830 align:start position:0%
regard to representative Lynn's Bill we
think

01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:57:50.450 --> 01:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:57:53.089 --> 01:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
um is deserving of study is deserving of
 
01:57:55.129 --> 01:57:55.139 align:start position:0%
either being retained or or put into a
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
study committee either in talking with
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
Frank Knack one of us will provide you
 
01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
with language that would substitute this
 
01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
into a study committee if that's the
 
01:58:06.410 --> 01:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
committee's desirable get that language
 
01:58:09.290 --> 01:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
to you or in the alternative we would
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
ask that it that would be retained in
 
01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
the committee so it can be heard by the
 
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee over the summer with a little
 
01:58:16.609 --> 01:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
more depth than than you can do uh in
 
01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
the rush of getting all your bills
 
01:58:20.689 --> 01:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
through we we think this is the right
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
approach eventually but we we do agree
 
01:58:25.970 --> 01:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
that it deserves further evaluation and
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
time to make sure it gets done right and
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
we also based upon the the stress that's
 
01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
currently in the system to take on a
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
whole new system of magistrates that
 
01:58:40.250 --> 01:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
that currently doesn't exist
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
um uh the the staff the administrative
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
staff have simply said they can't do it
 
01:58:47.930 --> 01:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
it's just not feasible in terms of the
 
01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
burden that they're currently
 
01:58:52.250 --> 01:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
undertaking so we do we do ask that it
 
01:58:54.169 --> 01:58:54.179 align:start position:0%
stay alive but that either be retained
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
or put into a study so we can evaluate
 
01:58:58.609 --> 01:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
all the issues whether there is a a
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
benefit to having a joint system bail
 
01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and magistrates
 
01:59:08.450 --> 01:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
what are the advantages remote we would
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
contemplate that that this would be a
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
remote process not an in-person process
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
we think these can be done remotely
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
judges are doing them remotely and we
 
01:59:19.370 --> 01:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
think this process can be done more
 
01:59:22.370 --> 01:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
efficiently and with that that is the
 
01:59:25.010 --> 01:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
ask will get you language and I'll
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments be happy to answer
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
any questions actually one other thing
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
last week representative Denver had
 
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
asked for the for the bail commissioner
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
handbook to be distributed I truly I
 
01:59:36.010 --> 01:59:36.020 align:start position:0%
just I forgot to do that I will do that
 
01:59:38.570 --> 01:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for that delay with that
 
01:59:40.729 --> 01:59:40.739 align:start position:0%
I will conclude my comments thank you
 
01:59:44.330 --> 01:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
for remembering that because I did not
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
um there'd be no questions thank you for
 
01:59:49.490 --> 01:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you oh I'm sorry uh
 
01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative side okay
 
01:59:52.679 --> 02:00:01.010 align:start position:0%
representative side okay
question

02:00:01.010 --> 02:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.050 --> 02:00:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
scitec I assume speaking in his capacity
 
02:00:18.530 --> 02:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
as a bail commissioner yeah I kept my
 
02:00:20.209 --> 02:00:20.219 align:start position:0%
mouth shut because I wanted to have the
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
option of being able to speak listen
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
I've heard some wonderful things but
 
02:00:27.169 --> 02:00:27.179 align:start position:0%
some not so wonderful things uh one of
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
the just the SWAT a fly Mr connect back
 
02:00:34.129 --> 02:00:34.139 align:start position:0%
there uh said that uh he talked about
 
02:00:36.609 --> 02:00:36.619 align:start position:0%
training I think he is conflating
 
02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
innocence and guilt with the question
 
02:00:42.890 --> 02:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
about making a decision with respect to
 
02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:44.030 align:start position:0%
about making a decision with respect to
release

02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
release
 
02:00:48.169 --> 02:00:48.179 align:start position:0%
uh the conditions for releases so I I
 
02:00:51.050 --> 02:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
just I that occurred to me as I heard
 
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
him I just heard Clarity you're not
 
02:00:55.729 --> 02:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
calling Mr kanaka fly you're talking
 
02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
about this no no not at all but I
 
02:01:04.189 --> 02:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
it's easy for one for to slosh from one
 
02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
compartment to another
 
02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
we're told uh very early on and this is
 
02:01:10.970 --> 02:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
just a no by the way because I thought
 
02:01:14.290 --> 02:01:14.300 align:start position:0%
of it it remembered it that the the
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
magistrates are going to know the
 
02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
community better they're going to be
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
able to make a more informed judgment
 
02:01:22.250 --> 02:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
well it's hard to believe on its face
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners know the police
 
02:01:26.689 --> 02:01:26.699 align:start position:0%
work all the time
 
02:01:29.810 --> 02:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
know their Community I we have frequent
 
02:01:33.169 --> 02:01:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
let me move to what's productive I have
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
tried very hard to understand what the
 
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
problem is where did what's the
 
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
provenance of this but why did and it's
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
finally occurred to me because I'm
 
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
really talking to Professor sharer and
 
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
to uh representative Harriet gathright
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on here is he identified
 
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
and I agree and this is where I think
 
02:01:59.810 --> 02:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
this should be going is the uneven
 
02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:01.129 align:start position:0%
this should be going is the uneven
training

02:02:01.129 --> 02:02:01.139 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
we what how did they look I trained Veil
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
I have trained bail Commissioners the
 
02:02:09.649 --> 02:02:09.659 align:start position:0%
last one who's covering for me today by
 
02:02:10.609 --> 02:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
the way
 
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
he went with me for two months
 
02:02:18.169 --> 02:02:18.179 align:start position:0%
uh to Pelham wind him in Salem
 
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
we it at night he never said no we and
 
02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
I learned I made some mistakes but I
 
02:02:28.609 --> 02:02:28.619 align:start position:0%
think I'm pretty good I don't think
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to find a magistrate that's
 
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
going to make a this is a bold statement
 
02:02:34.850 --> 02:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
but I don't think you're going to find a
 
02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
magistrate making a better release
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
decision I'm not talking about an
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
innocence or guilt or going to a trial
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
but to assess that person look I'll tell
 
02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
you here's another example of where your
 
02:02:49.609 --> 02:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
judgment comes in I had two boys two
 
02:02:52.089 --> 02:02:52.099 align:start position:0%
young men from the Bronx one was from
 
02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
Queens one was from another Borough they
 
02:02:58.209 --> 02:02:58.219 align:start position:0%
came up they had they were stealing
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
shoplifting Adidas sneakers
 
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at them different they're
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
New York are are they flight risks yes
 
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
am I going to say you're I'm going to
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
hold you
 
02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:14.820 align:start position:0%
because of a relatively minor I mean
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's real but it was relatively matter
 
02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's just not a good exercise of
 
02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
judgment because what I know what's
 
02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
going to happen is the judge will
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
release them the next day out of
 
02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
Brentwood they're going to be standing
 
02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
there in Brentwood no Transportation no
 
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
nothing is that the right thing to do of
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
course they were
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
I think they were probably guilty but I
 
02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:35.820 align:start position:0%
represent a system and I treat everybody
 
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
with respect because I'm tree I
 
02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
represent the system and that's the
 
02:03:43.609 --> 02:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
values I tried to inculcate so I am a as
 
02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
I listen to this I am a thousand percent
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
uh in favor of this idea of a training a
 
02:03:54.410 --> 02:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
formal training program look we train
 
02:03:56.689 --> 02:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
electricians why don't you that don't
 
02:03:59.330 --> 02:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
have to do with elect uh personal
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
Liberty Professor Sher talked about
 
02:04:05.930 --> 02:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
the unevenness of the hiring process and
 
02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's I I think that's where this
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
really came from and I'd like to ask
 
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
talk to him in the hallway because he
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
likes stories I'll tell them some
 
02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
stories about unevenness about Judges
 
02:04:18.530 --> 02:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
it's another day thank you it's all I
 
02:04:20.209 --> 02:04:20.219 align:start position:0%
wanted to say
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and with
 
02:04:26.209 --> 02:04:26.219 align:start position:0%
that I will close the public hearing
 
02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
on HB 400
 
02:04:33.050 --> 02:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
no excuse me 46 and I'm going to turn it
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
over to my vice chair so I can introduce
 
02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.570 --> 02:05:07.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.089 --> 02:05:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.099 --> 02:05:19.570 align:start position:0%
 
who

02:05:19.570 --> 02:05:19.580 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:05:22.609 --> 02:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
02:05:22.619 --> 02:05:25.370 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
foreign

02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:28.609 --> 02:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
I will now open the public hearing for
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 400 FN the committee
 
02:05:36.850 --> 02:05:36.860 align:start position:0%
recognizes chairman Roy
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um Madam chairwoman members of
 
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm here to introduce
 
02:05:46.129 --> 02:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
House Bill 400 relative to assault
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
certain assault offenses and bail
 
02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:50.089 align:start position:0%
certain assault offenses and bail
eligibility

02:05:50.089 --> 02:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is basically creating
 
02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
the offense of assault and battery on a
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
police officer
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is the only
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
and I repeat only state in the entire
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
country that does not have the charge of
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
assault and battery on a police officer
 
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
this bill would introduce the the crime
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
of assault and battery or police officer
 
02:06:14.330 --> 02:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
as well as expanding it to any EMS
 
02:06:18.410 --> 02:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
Personnel firefighters EMTs anyone who's
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
trying to do their job who's assaulted
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
by a member of the public while doing so
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
would be charged with this offense
 
02:06:27.770 --> 02:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
also part of the bill
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
it creates
 
02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
the ability for a police officer to
 
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
arrest someone who after being ordered
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
to stand back from them does not do so
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
we've all seen cases where police
 
02:06:40.729 --> 02:06:40.739 align:start position:0%
officers are flooded by people in their
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
personal space and it never ends well
 
02:06:46.810 --> 02:06:46.820 align:start position:0%
police officers have many
 
02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
tools at their disposal and they're on
 
02:06:52.010 --> 02:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
as far as use of force goes they're
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
unable to use those when someone is
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
inside six inches in their personal
 
02:06:57.649 --> 02:06:57.659 align:start position:0%
space in their face it takes things away
 
02:06:59.629 --> 02:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
from him it limits their ability to
 
02:07:02.450 --> 02:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
manage the situation
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
um years ago there was a study
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
I believe it was called the 21 foot rule
 
02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:09.229 align:start position:0%
I believe it was called the 21 foot rule
that

02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
someone running at you with a knife
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
would be able to stab you before you'd
 
02:07:14.689 --> 02:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
be able to draw your side arm and stop
 
02:07:14.699 --> 02:07:15.589 align:start position:0%
be able to draw your side arm and stop
him

02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
so anyone inside that zone is a danger
 
02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:21.470 align:start position:0%
so anyone inside that zone is a danger
um

02:07:21.470 --> 02:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
so the ability of an officer to say
 
02:07:27.169 --> 02:07:27.179 align:start position:0%
get back you're within my space and if a
 
02:07:28.970 --> 02:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
person refuses to do so and they're able
 
02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
to do so obviously you can't do that if
 
02:07:33.229 --> 02:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
it's small space and the bill spells out
 
02:07:33.239 --> 02:07:34.250 align:start position:0%
it's small space and the bill spells out
that

02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:36.410 --> 02:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
that they would be subject to arrest for
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
failing to obey that order
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
right now in this country we are
 
02:07:42.890 --> 02:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
focusing a very
 
02:07:44.930 --> 02:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
powerful lens on the police departments
 
02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
and justifiably so
 
02:07:50.330 --> 02:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
at the same time we have to be able to
 
02:07:53.089 --> 02:07:53.099 align:start position:0%
if we expect them to behave in a certain
 
02:07:55.070 --> 02:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
way and to operate at a certain level of
 
02:07:57.229 --> 02:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
professionalness we have to do our best
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
to provide a safe environment for them
 
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
02:08:02.689 --> 02:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
right now assaulting a police officers
 
02:08:07.729 --> 02:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
the same assaulting anyone else if in a
 
02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
bar no difference at all
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
assaulting a police officer is not only
 
02:08:16.070 --> 02:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
assaulting a police officer it's
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
assaulting the criminal justice system
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's assaulting the rule of law they are
 
02:08:24.290 --> 02:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
there on the spot representing that
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's not just about the person the man
 
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
or woman wearing the badge it's about
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
what they represent while they're there
 
02:08:33.050 --> 02:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
and assaulting one of them
 
02:08:35.149 --> 02:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
in my mind there's no difference in
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
assaulting a judge or someone else they
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
all represent parts of the judicial
 
02:08:43.729 --> 02:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
system and therefore they represent us
 
02:08:48.890 --> 02:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:52.129 --> 02:08:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:54.169 --> 02:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
would you believe that rule is now 31
 
02:08:54.179 --> 02:08:55.250 align:start position:0%
would you believe that rule is now 31
feet

02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
feet
 
02:08:56.689 --> 02:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
I would believe that people are getting
 
02:08:56.699 --> 02:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
I would believe that people are getting
faster

02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
further questions I'm sure we'll have a
 
02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
vigorous debate during executive
 
02:09:11.390 --> 02:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:29.450 align:start position:0%
good morning
um

02:09:29.450 --> 02:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:32.109 --> 02:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
just to get this on the record I'm a
 
02:09:35.209 --> 02:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
posture I'm a professor at UNH law I'm
 
02:09:37.070 --> 02:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
also an elected Police Commissioner in
 
02:09:40.609 --> 02:09:40.619 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth my testimony reflects my
 
02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
opinion not those of unh UNH law or the
 
02:09:45.709 --> 02:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Police Commissioner Police
 
02:09:45.719 --> 02:09:46.570 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Police Commissioner Police
Department

02:09:46.570 --> 02:09:46.580 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of this bill uh with uh
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
one change at two locations
 
02:09:57.890 --> 02:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
um on uh page one
 
02:10:01.209 --> 02:10:01.219 align:start position:0%
if I can find page one
 
02:10:06.770 --> 02:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh sub paragraph two lines 23 and 25 if
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
the court finds probable cause to
 
02:10:09.770 --> 02:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
believe such persons value the
 
02:10:11.810 --> 02:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
subparagraph shall be considered
 
02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
dangerous Etc and and be held without
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
bail I think that needs to uh to Accord
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
with the Constitution that needs to have
 
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
a standard of clear and convincing
 
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
evidence rather than probable cause in
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
terms of the law probable cause is a
 
02:10:28.490 --> 02:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
lesser standard than clear and
 
02:10:31.550 --> 02:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence and so I think that
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
change needs to be made to make it
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional and that same issue
 
02:10:40.729 --> 02:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
exists on page two lines four through
 
02:10:40.739 --> 02:10:42.169 align:start position:0%
exists on page two lines four through
six

02:10:42.169 --> 02:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
six
 
02:10:45.410 --> 02:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
um other than that I mean I'm in support
 
02:10:55.129 --> 02:10:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.290 --> 02:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about at least the
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
three offenses the um but it doesn't
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
show penalties is that penalty is
 
02:11:03.890 --> 02:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and yeah that penalty
 
02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
exists elsewhere in the criminal code so
 
02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's just that these would be new
 
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
offenses that would be subject to those
 
02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.450 --> 02:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:28.729 --> 02:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:31.729 --> 02:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
good morning again thank you again David
 
02:11:34.669 --> 02:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
Rothstein and I'm here on behalf of the
 
02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of criminal
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers which uh opposes this uh
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
bill so a few comments
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
um obviously we all respect the work
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
that police officers do and that police
 
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
officers and others EMTs and other
 
02:11:54.490 --> 02:11:54.500 align:start position:0%
related people are in potentially
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
dangerous situations need protection I
 
02:11:59.209 --> 02:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
would draw the committee's attention to
 
02:12:04.089 --> 02:12:04.099 align:start position:0%
RSA 651 colon six one
 
02:12:10.189 --> 02:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
G RSA 651 colon 6 Roman numeral 1G which
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
talk about talks about the ability of a
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutor to file a notice of extended
 
02:12:16.669 --> 02:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
term of imprisonment meaning an
 
02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
enhancement of a penalty if someone has
 
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
knowingly committed or attempted to
 
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
commit any of the crimes defined in RSA
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
631 which is the assault statute where
 
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
he or she knows the victim at the time
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
of the commission of a crime was a law
 
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer firefighter or
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
licensed EMT acting in the line of duty
 
02:12:38.930 --> 02:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
so I would say that there is already in
 
02:12:42.109 --> 02:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
our law a level of protection that
 
02:12:44.689 --> 02:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
exists in the rsas that a prosecutor
 
02:12:46.370 --> 02:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
within a prosecutor's discretion can
 
02:12:50.209 --> 02:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
file a notice and if a jury finds that
 
02:12:52.850 --> 02:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
enhancing fact instead of simple assault
 
02:12:54.410 --> 02:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
the defendant could be convicted well
 
02:12:55.490 --> 02:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
the defendant would be convicted of
 
02:12:57.410 --> 02:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
simple assault instead of it being a
 
02:12:58.850 --> 02:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
plain old misdemeanor there would be a
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
potential of two to five years in the
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
state prison so there is already a
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
provision in our law that I would submit
 
02:13:07.850 --> 02:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
addresses this this issue which is an
 
02:13:11.689 --> 02:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
important issue that rsas also address a
 
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
situation where someone causes serious
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
bodily injury or acts with a deadly
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
weapon and I would certainly say that if
 
02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
someone causes serious bodily injury or
 
02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
acts with a deadly weapon against
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
anybody whether it be a police officer
 
02:13:28.010 --> 02:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
EMT I would certainly understand at
 
02:13:30.050 --> 02:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
least in the first instance the ability
 
02:13:31.550 --> 02:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
to bring a felony and our law is
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
obviously already provide for that
 
02:13:36.109 --> 02:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that concerned me
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
about this bill I guess most and and an
 
02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
anecdote because I happen to meet with a
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
client yesterday
 
02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
was the enhancement of simple assault
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
the second degree assault when the
 
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
simple assault which is unprivileged
 
02:13:53.689 --> 02:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
physical conduct is knowing or Reckless
 
02:13:57.050 --> 02:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
and results in bodily injury or
 
02:13:58.729 --> 02:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
unprivileged physical contact so not
 
02:14:01.069 --> 02:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury a client very
 
02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
recently a man with for all intents and
 
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
purposes no criminal record his
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
significant other brought him into an
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
emergency room he was suffering from
 
02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol withdrawal he was delusional he
 
02:14:15.649 --> 02:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
did not know where he was he did not
 
02:14:18.169 --> 02:14:18.179 align:start position:0%
know what he was doing unfortunately he
 
02:14:19.609 --> 02:14:19.619 align:start position:0%
came into contact with the security
 
02:14:22.189 --> 02:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
guard and he struck a security guard it
 
02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
was a simple assault under our laws
 
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
under this statute however he would be
 
02:14:29.450 --> 02:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
charged with second degree assault
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
because he arguably acted knowingly or
 
02:14:35.089 --> 02:14:35.099 align:start position:0%
recklessly and also under the bail
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
provision he would likely be held
 
02:14:40.189 --> 02:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
without bail and I would suggest that
 
02:14:43.850 --> 02:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
you know these situations that EMTs and
 
02:14:45.530 --> 02:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
police officers deal with with people
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
who are in um the throes of a medical
 
02:14:50.930 --> 02:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
emergency whether they're suffering from
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
psychosis substance use disorder
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
withdrawal they're very difficult
 
02:14:57.890 --> 02:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
situations for anybody but I I think in
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
most cases it would be an unfortunate
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
consequence to say that such a person
 
02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
should be charged with a felony assault
 
02:15:09.770 --> 02:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
now if they cause serious bodily injury
 
02:15:12.410 --> 02:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
if they have a deadly weapon I think I
 
02:15:13.609 --> 02:15:13.619 align:start position:0%
think that's a whole different story
 
02:15:15.649 --> 02:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
obviously we would say that someone in
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
that position
 
02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
should probably be charged with a felony
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
assault and we'll sort out later what
 
02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
their mental state was but I it just
 
02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
seems to me when I read this bill it
 
02:15:26.689 --> 02:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
just seemed to me that we're taking a
 
02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
situation where police officers EMTs
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
have to have contact with people who are
 
02:15:34.729 --> 02:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
in significant distress there could be
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
some flailing around that occurs or some
 
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
resistance I remember back when I took
 
02:15:41.209 --> 02:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
Advanced life saving I was told that if
 
02:15:42.770 --> 02:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
you're trying to save somebody who's
 
02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
drowning they often will try to hit you
 
02:15:47.209 --> 02:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
they'll try they don't realize what
 
02:15:48.410 --> 02:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
you're what you're doing and they'll
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
they'll punch you and that's a situation
 
02:15:52.850 --> 02:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately can arise we don't
 
02:15:54.890 --> 02:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
like it we don't want it to arise but it
 
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
can but the consequence of having
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
somebody charged with a felony in that
 
02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
situation seemed to me to be
 
02:16:03.770 --> 02:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
particularly troubling and particularly
 
02:16:07.069 --> 02:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
not necessary in terms of my client he's
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
charged with simple assault and we'll
 
02:16:10.250 --> 02:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
see if the court system believes he
 
02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
should be convicted of simple assault if
 
02:16:14.750 --> 02:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
he should then he should I will um
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
cease my comments there and I'd be glad
 
02:16:20.450 --> 02:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:23.930 --> 02:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
have you ever heard of the CIT training
 
02:16:27.169 --> 02:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
the acronym can you just uh
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
so it's called critical incident
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
training right yeah a lot of the police
 
02:16:33.589 --> 02:16:33.599 align:start position:0%
officers are taking it to recognize
 
02:16:36.049 --> 02:16:36.059 align:start position:0%
those people who may have a disability
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
or whatever and that's why they're
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
acting out and I know uh from my
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
experience of
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
45 years as an EMT and firefighter we
 
02:16:47.450 --> 02:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
take that into account that if it's a
 
02:16:49.730 --> 02:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
medical emergency we don't we're not
 
02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
looking to charge these people with
 
02:16:55.250 --> 02:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
any crime right right but
 
02:16:56.929 --> 02:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
the one that just punches me because
 
02:16:58.690 --> 02:16:58.700 align:start position:0%
they don't like what I'm doing
 
02:17:03.049 --> 02:17:03.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:06.290 --> 02:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think yeah right I think I
 
02:17:07.969 --> 02:17:07.979 align:start position:0%
just to address the the question
 
02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative I I think
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
um I I think that if
 
02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:14.030 align:start position:0%
um I I think that if
um

02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
I think obviously there it's the statute
 
02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
does not recognize that distinction the
 
02:17:20.509 --> 02:17:20.519 align:start position:0%
statue talks about somebody acting
 
02:17:20.519 --> 02:17:21.950 align:start position:0%
statue talks about somebody acting
recklessly

02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
recklessly
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
um so the statute does not recognize the
 
02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
distinction you're talking about in
 
02:17:26.089 --> 02:17:26.099 align:start position:0%
other incidents I don't know if you've
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
ever administered Narcan that's another
 
02:17:29.889 --> 02:17:29.899 align:start position:0%
instance where people coming out of
 
02:17:32.690 --> 02:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
Narcan they do you know they do flail
 
02:17:34.310 --> 02:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
around under this statute as it's
 
02:17:36.290 --> 02:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
written and I understand what you're
 
02:17:38.570 --> 02:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
saying that person would would be
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
charged with second degree assault
 
02:17:42.589 --> 02:17:42.599 align:start position:0%
somebody who sees you coming toward them
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
and punches you like anybody else
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's domestic violence whether
 
02:17:49.370 --> 02:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
it's anybody else they should
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
potentially be charged with um they
 
02:17:52.310 --> 02:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
should potentially be charged with
 
02:17:53.929 --> 02:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
simple assault
 
02:17:56.089 --> 02:17:56.099 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't have your your your
 
02:17:58.129 --> 02:17:58.139 align:start position:0%
life your life experience and I don't
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
purport to
 
02:18:01.250 --> 02:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
um but this statute as it's drafted it
 
02:18:03.410 --> 02:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
seems to me would draw in some of those
 
02:18:05.209 --> 02:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
people you're talking about who frankly
 
02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
should not be charged with a felony
 
02:18:06.420 --> 02:18:07.790 align:start position:0%
should not be charged with a felony
assault

02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
assault
 
02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Pratt
 
02:18:13.009 --> 02:18:13.019 align:start position:0%
so I have a question uh for your
 
02:18:14.929 --> 02:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
testimony you believe that somebody was
 
02:18:16.429 --> 02:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
drowning with flailing on their arms
 
02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
around could be charged with a felony
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
the way this is written yes because they
 
02:18:23.810 --> 02:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
are recklessly they are recklessly uh
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
arguably recklessly engaging in
 
02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
um conduct and inflicting
 
02:18:31.610 --> 02:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
bodily injury or engaging in
 
02:18:35.389 --> 02:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:37.129 --> 02:18:37.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer
 
02:18:39.530 --> 02:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative select
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing my question and
 
02:18:43.969 --> 02:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:18:45.169 --> 02:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
um sorry it's taking me a moment to
 
02:18:46.969 --> 02:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
organize my thought I'm I'm curious
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of cases nationally
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
where people have been videotaping the
 
02:18:52.849 --> 02:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
actions of police
 
02:18:55.310 --> 02:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious how if they were within
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
the 21 foot barrier
 
02:19:00.889 --> 02:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
um how that would relate to this right
 
02:19:05.450 --> 02:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
that's you know I didn't speak to that
 
02:19:08.089 --> 02:19:08.099 align:start position:0%
that part of the statute it there are
 
02:19:09.709 --> 02:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
there is
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
um a first circuit case that I'm aware
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
of and I think there's a New Hampshire
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
case that I'm aware of that does
 
02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:16.810 align:start position:0%
case that I'm aware of that does
um

02:19:16.810 --> 02:19:16.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
validate or vindicate someone's ability
 
02:19:21.410 --> 02:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
02:19:23.389 --> 02:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
um they have a phone to be able to
 
02:19:26.330 --> 02:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
record what the police are doing
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
um it you know it seems to me that that
 
02:19:32.089 --> 02:19:32.099 align:start position:0%
it's it's possible that this statute
 
02:19:32.099 --> 02:19:33.530 align:start position:0%
it's it's possible that this statute
could

02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
um infringe upon that I mean I'm really
 
02:19:40.009 --> 02:19:40.019 align:start position:0%
I I'm definitely less familiar with the
 
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
the this this circumstance and I'm not
 
02:19:45.169 --> 02:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
familiar with the the necessity for I
 
02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
mean I can certainly understand that a
 
02:19:47.929 --> 02:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
police officer needs to be able to do
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
his job and there are statutes
 
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a statue disobeying
 
02:19:54.410 --> 02:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
a police officer disorderly conduct if
 
02:19:57.170 --> 02:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
an officer gives you a lawful command
 
02:19:59.389 --> 02:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
um and you you do not
 
02:20:00.889 --> 02:20:00.899 align:start position:0%
um adhere to that command you can be
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
charged with disobeying a police officer
 
02:20:03.469 --> 02:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
you can be charged with this early
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
conduct it does seem to me that the
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
statute in some instances could infringe
 
02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
on a person's lawful ability to either
 
02:20:14.929 --> 02:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
observe or to record what the police
 
02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:24.050 --> 02:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:24.889 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
um

02:20:24.889 --> 02:20:24.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
there's a couple I have two questions if
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
I make first is with respect to your
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
client who is delusional
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
don't you have to have a men's Raya in
 
02:20:39.309 --> 02:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
order to commit a crime no matter how
 
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
devastating it may have been to the
 
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
officer to anybody he was not in a he
 
02:20:49.610 --> 02:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
was not intending to commit a crime so
 
02:20:51.530 --> 02:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
aren't you mixing a couple Concepts here
 
02:20:53.870 --> 02:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
I I'm not actually representative I'm
 
02:20:55.610 --> 02:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
not mixing the concepts my client got
 
02:20:55.620 --> 02:20:56.750 align:start position:0%
not mixing the concepts my client got
charged

02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
charged
 
02:20:59.389 --> 02:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
um and and he get charged with simple
 
02:21:01.969 --> 02:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
assault under this statute he would have
 
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
been charged with second degree assault
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
even though
 
02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
um the the there were people at the
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
hospital who said he was talking about
 
02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
going up to the third floor of the
 
02:21:13.610 --> 02:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
hospital because he had to save people
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
who were being I mean just really
 
02:21:18.530 --> 02:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
nonsense obviously he was not he was not
 
02:21:21.469 --> 02:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
oriented as to as to time and space
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
this is where I see the statue
 
02:21:25.010 --> 02:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
potentially being overbought obviously
 
02:21:26.450 --> 02:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
it would be great if we could trust
 
02:21:28.849 --> 02:21:28.859 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial discretion not to charge
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
those people but the person that I met
 
02:21:32.809 --> 02:21:32.819 align:start position:0%
the person that I represent has been
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
drawn into this and yes you're exactly
 
02:21:37.309 --> 02:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
right if this case goes to trial my
 
02:21:39.410 --> 02:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
defense will be that he did not have the
 
02:21:43.370 --> 02:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
men's Rhea or that his act of I think it
 
02:21:45.770 --> 02:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
was punching the uh the person in the
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
hospital was not a truly voluntarily
 
02:21:50.210 --> 02:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
volitional act the bottom line is though
 
02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
he would have been charged under this
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
statute with second-degree assault
 
02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:00.349 --> 02:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you all right very reasonable but
 
02:22:02.210 --> 02:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
the other question is
 
02:22:06.290 --> 02:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
the what I wanted to ask first is you
 
02:22:09.650 --> 02:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
said that there was enhanced an ability
 
02:22:12.410 --> 02:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
to uh apply for enhanced penalties
 
02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
because of the that's great and I I
 
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
think you have a point there but doesn't
 
02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:18.849 align:start position:0%
think you have a point there but doesn't
this

02:22:18.849 --> 02:22:18.859 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
does this bill not remove the discretion
 
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
maybe the prosecutor just didn't want to
 
02:22:28.429 --> 02:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
go after enhanced uh and the enhanced
 
02:22:30.530 --> 02:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
penalties whereas this bill would
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
require that because of the nature of
 
02:22:34.610 --> 02:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement office or whatever I
 
02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
I I definitely can see I'd have to look
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
at the specific language of the bill
 
02:22:43.490 --> 02:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
again but it does seem to me that if you
 
02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:44.570 align:start position:0%
again but it does seem to me that if you
have

02:22:44.570 --> 02:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:22:48.290 --> 02:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
um if you basically it's it's a status
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
offense so basically if you determine
 
02:22:52.370 --> 02:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
that the person assaulted had a
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
particular status then it's a felony
 
02:22:56.750 --> 02:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't I mean to me that doesn't
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
mean that it can't necessarily be plea
 
02:23:00.590 --> 02:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
bargained for whatever reason down the
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
road I don't think
 
02:23:03.770 --> 02:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
I don't think the bill removes the
 
02:23:05.809 --> 02:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
prerogative to say that this person
 
02:23:07.130 --> 02:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
should you know should have a
 
02:23:08.570 --> 02:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor instead of a felony or
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be I I do think you're
 
02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
right I do think that what it does is it
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
singles out the circumstance it singles
 
02:23:17.389 --> 02:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
out these particular people because of
 
02:23:19.849 --> 02:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
their status and it says that a simple
 
02:23:22.490 --> 02:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
assault should in the first instance be
 
02:23:25.250 --> 02:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
charged based on that status as a felony
 
02:23:26.990 --> 02:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
instead of a misdemeanor so I do think
 
02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
instead of a misdemeanor so I do think
it

02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
does it totally remove discretion is a
 
02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
tough question I don't know if a
 
02:23:32.990 --> 02:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutor would still have discretion
 
02:23:34.429 --> 02:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
to charge a simple assault but the
 
02:23:36.290 --> 02:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
message to the prosecutor that the
 
02:23:37.969 --> 02:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
legislature would be sending is that
 
02:23:40.130 --> 02:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
it's Our intention that you charge a
 
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:48.410 --> 02:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:58.010 --> 02:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this is Chief refonsky
 
02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:03.770 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this is Chief refonsky
or

02:24:03.770 --> 02:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:24:03.780 --> 02:24:07.849 align:start position:0%
or
baby

02:24:07.849 --> 02:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:10.010 --> 02:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I often know with
 
02:24:12.050 --> 02:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
the look when they look at the card that
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
is usually me
 
02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:15.469 align:start position:0%
is usually me
uh

02:24:15.469 --> 02:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh members of the committee my name is
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
John burfonski I'm the chief of police
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
in Bedford New Hampshire and I'm also
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire
 
02:24:25.370 --> 02:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police
 
02:24:27.889 --> 02:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
representing more than 160 Chiefs across
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
the Great Granite State and we are here
 
02:24:34.510 --> 02:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
in in support of HB 400 predictably
 
02:24:37.610 --> 02:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
there are a number of benefits that
 
02:24:39.889 --> 02:24:39.899 align:start position:0%
arise from this bill but let me speak to
 
02:24:42.770 --> 02:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
the issues that may have already been
 
02:24:44.270 --> 02:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
brought up by some of the previous
 
02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
testimony to Phil fill in the gaps but
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
first let me say that police officers is
 
02:24:53.210 --> 02:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
not a week that goes by in the granite
 
02:24:55.610 --> 02:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
state where one of your police officers
 
02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
Troopers or deputies isn't engaged in a
 
02:25:02.090 --> 02:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
struggle or worse in a fight in the
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
exercise of their lawful duties and
 
02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and I underscore lawful
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
duties and responsibilities for example
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
just this past week one of my female
 
02:25:14.090 --> 02:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
officers Was Bitten and not by an animal
 
02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
was bitten by a human who human bite
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
which we all know is something that
 
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
could be very serious
 
02:25:24.410 --> 02:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
and these sorts of actions go on quite
 
02:25:26.690 --> 02:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
frequently and more frequently than um
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
than we would like to see obviously and
 
02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
more frequently than perhaps you would
 
02:25:34.490 --> 02:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
like to see in Manchester my colleagues
 
02:25:37.130 --> 02:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
in Manchester I would believe that they
 
02:25:39.889 --> 02:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
would tell you that the altercations
 
02:25:42.429 --> 02:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
that they have in response to resistance
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
to their lawful commands is is happening
 
02:25:48.050 --> 02:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
quite frequently I can recall one case
 
02:25:50.809 --> 02:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
about a year ago when a Manchester
 
02:25:52.849 --> 02:25:52.859 align:start position:0%
police officer was engaged in a struggle
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
with an individual who had been arrested
 
02:25:56.809 --> 02:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
and released on a number of occasions
 
02:25:59.870 --> 02:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
the officer's leg was broken in
 
02:26:03.010 --> 02:26:03.020 align:start position:0%
connection with that particular case and
 
02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
unbelievably the individual who was
 
02:26:08.690 --> 02:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
charged was released on his own
 
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
recognizance and back out on the street
 
02:26:12.410 --> 02:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
probably while the officer was still in
 
02:26:13.250 --> 02:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
02:26:15.770 --> 02:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
so there's quite a bit of an impact on
 
02:26:17.929 --> 02:26:17.939 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement Community as we
 
02:26:21.410 --> 02:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
struggle to recruit individuals who want
 
02:26:24.670 --> 02:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
to take up the Baton in this profession
 
02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
and carry on the mission of Public
 
02:26:29.469 --> 02:26:29.479 align:start position:0%
Safety in your communities
 
02:26:33.230 --> 02:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
for placing themselves In Harm's Way
 
02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
each and every day and night here in the
 
02:26:37.330 --> 02:26:37.340 align:start position:0%
granite state to protect you
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
and yet there is no statute as was
 
02:26:43.809 --> 02:26:43.819 align:start position:0%
brought up in previous testimony that
 
02:26:46.969 --> 02:26:46.979 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses assaults on
 
02:26:50.570 --> 02:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
police officers the statute with respect
 
02:26:52.210 --> 02:26:52.220 align:start position:0%
to sentencing enhancement
 
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that isn't after the
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
fact measure that means that there is
 
02:27:00.770 --> 02:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
likely no knowledge in the community
 
02:27:03.770 --> 02:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
that that statute exists there's no
 
02:27:05.809 --> 02:27:05.819 align:start position:0%
knowledge in the community that
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutors are likely to
 
02:27:11.450 --> 02:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
use that sentencing enhancement when
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
charging or bringing before judge
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
someone who assaulted a police officer
 
02:27:19.010 --> 02:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
so the effect is after the fact meaning
 
02:27:21.469 --> 02:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
the harm against the first responder
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
police Fire EMS or police officer
 
02:27:27.170 --> 02:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
Sheriff Deputy or Trooper has already
 
02:27:30.590 --> 02:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
occurred so with all due respect a
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
sentencing enhancement has no
 
02:27:35.929 --> 02:27:35.939 align:start position:0%
predictable effect on creating a
 
02:27:38.450 --> 02:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
predisposition not to assault police
 
02:27:41.929 --> 02:27:41.939 align:start position:0%
officers and we think that and when I
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
say police officers I would like to
 
02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee to recognize that it also
 
02:27:48.250 --> 02:27:48.260 align:start position:0%
pertains to all First Responders
 
02:27:51.230 --> 02:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
we we desperately need to send a message
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
to the community that on the side of the
 
02:27:57.530 --> 02:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
road on the street in the middle of a
 
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
case is not the time to argue your case
 
02:28:04.090 --> 02:28:04.100 align:start position:0%
with a trooper Deputy or police officer
 
02:28:07.309 --> 02:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
that time to do that is before a judge
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
but not on the street and so this
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
particular Bill sends a good message and
 
02:28:16.270 --> 02:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
that is don't assault police officers
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
there is also opportunities for the good
 
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys to argue before the
 
02:28:24.590 --> 02:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
judge any mitigating circumstances with
 
02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
respect to the context of how a
 
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
particular first responder was assaulted
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
the County attorneys are under legal
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
obligation not to bring cases forward
 
02:28:37.969 --> 02:28:37.979 align:start position:0%
unless they believe that they can gain a
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
conviction that's part of their ethical
 
02:28:43.490 --> 02:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
rules of conduct and as one of the
 
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee rightly
 
02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
indicated that that requires that a
 
02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
culpable State of Mind exists to commit
 
02:28:52.450 --> 02:28:52.460 align:start position:0%
the elements of the charge
 
02:28:56.270 --> 02:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
so with with that in mind uh and of
 
02:28:57.889 --> 02:28:57.899 align:start position:0%
course the other provisions of the bill
 
02:29:01.610 --> 02:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
we we also support but uh I think that
 
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly important in today's day
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
and age to recognize the dangers and the
 
02:29:09.309 --> 02:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
perils that all First Responders face
 
02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
this bill goes some good distance and
 
02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:13.570 align:start position:0%
this bill goes some good distance and
measure

02:29:13.570 --> 02:29:13.580 align:start position:0%
measure
 
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
forward in helping bridge the gap and
 
02:29:20.210 --> 02:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
02:29:25.849 --> 02:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
so the last part that you just said that
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
this this creation of this law would uh
 
02:29:41.929 --> 02:29:41.939 align:start position:0%
more or less my verbiage send a message
 
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
to people people would become become
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact
 
02:29:50.090 --> 02:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
that this activity that's defined here
 
02:29:52.969 --> 02:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
um has penalties and so what
 
02:29:54.770 --> 02:29:54.780 align:start position:0%
um associated with it in the current law
 
02:29:57.889 --> 02:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
you can enhance the penalty but nobody
 
02:30:00.889 --> 02:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
knows that you enhance the penalty so
 
02:30:04.370 --> 02:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
so what would be the effect of having on
 
02:30:05.870 --> 02:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
the duties that you perform what would
 
02:30:08.270 --> 02:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
be the effect on people
 
02:30:09.889 --> 02:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
um what would it be like when they and
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
how would that get around and how would
 
02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
that help could you just expound on that
 
02:30:15.650 --> 02:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
a little bit sure and and thank you for
 
02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
the question uh as members of the
 
02:30:22.010 --> 02:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
legislature every law that you enact uh
 
02:30:24.889 --> 02:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
sends a message to the community in the
 
02:30:26.510 --> 02:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
citizens of Granite State and this is no
 
02:30:29.570 --> 02:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
different I can tell you from my almost
 
02:30:32.030 --> 02:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
now 45 years of experience having been
 
02:30:34.250 --> 02:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
on the receiving end and the losing end
 
02:30:36.410 --> 02:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
of a number of Street battles in my
 
02:30:39.889 --> 02:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
career that the folks that typically
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
engage in struggles against police
 
02:30:43.969 --> 02:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
officers intentionally and wantonly
 
02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
right are fully aware of what the impact
 
02:30:49.969 --> 02:30:49.979 align:start position:0%
that may occur if they were to be
 
02:30:52.389 --> 02:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
convicted of assaulting a police officer
 
02:30:55.370 --> 02:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
and I know on the federal side where the
 
02:30:58.510 --> 02:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
penalties are are quite strong that
 
02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
criminal defendants are
 
02:31:05.450 --> 02:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
very much aware of what they face if
 
02:31:07.130 --> 02:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
they engage in that behavior and
 
02:31:10.730 --> 02:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
activity so uh to answer your question
 
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
specifically once if the bill does pass
 
02:31:16.130 --> 02:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
and is enacted and signed by the
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
governor there will be some publicity
 
02:31:22.010 --> 02:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
that will extend from that and the
 
02:31:23.929 --> 02:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
criminal defense bar will be aware of
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
that and So eventually folks will be
 
02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
fully aware of the consequences right
 
02:31:34.610 --> 02:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
consequences and that's that's something
 
02:31:36.650 --> 02:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
that is incredibly important to
 
02:31:38.889 --> 02:31:38.899 align:start position:0%
remembering the context of criminal law
 
02:31:42.130 --> 02:31:42.140 align:start position:0%
because consequences do dissuade people
 
02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
from engaging in behavior that you as
 
02:31:48.010 --> 02:31:48.020 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature
 
02:31:50.389 --> 02:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
representing all of us don't want them
 
02:31:52.730 --> 02:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
to engage in
 
02:31:55.070 --> 02:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Harry gathright
 
02:31:59.750 --> 02:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you keep data on
 
02:32:04.730 --> 02:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
any of these incidents with the First
 
02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:06.410 align:start position:0%
any of these incidents with the First
Responders

02:32:06.410 --> 02:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
Responders
 
02:32:08.450 --> 02:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in in the state of New
 
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we we have no Central database
 
02:32:14.450 --> 02:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to acquire data with
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
respect to assaults on police officers
 
02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
and that extends to all the various
 
02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
other issues that we face it would be
 
02:32:23.210 --> 02:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
great if we had one Central Records
 
02:32:25.490 --> 02:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
management system and database that we
 
02:32:28.610 --> 02:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
could query every 177 police departments
 
02:32:31.910 --> 02:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
across the state to determine or a
 
02:32:34.370 --> 02:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
Judicial database to determine who was
 
02:32:36.349 --> 02:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
charged who was convicted on certain
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
crimes including this if it were to pass
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
so we do not have that data
 
02:32:45.710 --> 02:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
hello follow-up okay so I guess my other
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
question would be do you you gave us an
 
02:32:50.450 --> 02:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
example from a year ago
 
02:32:53.450 --> 02:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
um in Manchester do you get the same
 
02:32:56.809 --> 02:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
type of issues across the state
 
02:32:59.889 --> 02:32:59.899 align:start position:0%
anecdotally as they say right
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
yes that that is in fact the case do I
 
02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:04.610 align:start position:0%
yes that that is in fact the case do I
have

02:33:04.610 --> 02:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:33:07.309 --> 02:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
um cases um that were that I'm
 
02:33:09.050 --> 02:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
personally aware of and speaking with my
 
02:33:13.130 --> 02:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
colleagues absolutely uh the media is
 
02:33:15.770 --> 02:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
replete there was a case recently where
 
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
an officer was assaulted in connection
 
02:33:19.010 --> 02:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
with a particular matter that was
 
02:33:23.330 --> 02:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
published on wmur's website uh so again
 
02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
this occurs rather frequently and from
 
02:33:27.650 --> 02:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
discussion with my colleagues across the
 
02:33:30.889 --> 02:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
state uh again not a week goes by where
 
02:33:34.130 --> 02:33:34.140 align:start position:0%
some officer doesn't in get engaged in
 
02:33:36.650 --> 02:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
some type of physical altercation or
 
02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:37.849 align:start position:0%
some type of physical altercation or
worse

02:33:37.849 --> 02:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
worse
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative Jennifer
 
02:33:43.730 --> 02:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you chief for
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
um so I've been sitting here looking
 
02:33:50.590 --> 02:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
over different things
 
02:33:54.530 --> 02:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
presently right now under statute
 
02:33:57.170 --> 02:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
it's it's illegal to commit first degree
 
02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
assault secondary degree assault simple
 
02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
assault if it involves a police officer
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
that can also be charged with resisting
 
02:34:06.590 --> 02:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
arrest and if there's a serious bodily
 
02:34:09.410 --> 02:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
injury to that officer it's a class B
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
felony uh you have an enhanced
 
02:34:15.410 --> 02:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty during sentencing by a
 
02:34:19.309 --> 02:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
fighter or EMT so
 
02:34:21.770 --> 02:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
we've given a lot of tools here for the
 
02:34:23.929 --> 02:34:23.939 align:start position:0%
prosecution to do their job
 
02:34:25.969 --> 02:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
and and basically
 
02:34:28.910 --> 02:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
what you're telling us is that we're
 
02:34:30.770 --> 02:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
we're going to say stop or I'll say stop
 
02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
again is that is that you you need one
 
02:34:35.450 --> 02:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
more one more law to tell them it's not
 
02:34:38.450 --> 02:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
allowed to do is is that correct that's
 
02:34:40.670 --> 02:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
precisely correct what we're saying here
 
02:34:43.610 --> 02:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
is that the measures that are currently
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
in place do not dissuade people from
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
engaging in physical conduct that ends
 
02:34:52.010 --> 02:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
up hurting First Responders and that's
 
02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:01.309 align:start position:0%
 
yep

02:35:01.309 --> 02:35:01.319 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:35:03.650 --> 02:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:35:06.370 --> 02:35:06.380 align:start position:0%
you guys got to get your hands up
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
do you have do you have a second for one
 
02:35:10.730 --> 02:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
more question
 
02:35:14.270 --> 02:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
yes terrific thank you uh Professor Sher
 
02:35:17.570 --> 02:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh kind of what he felt was a
 
02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:25.070 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh kind of what he felt was a
constitution

02:35:25.070 --> 02:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:31.570 --> 02:35:31.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:35.330 --> 02:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
I I believe that with respect to
 
02:35:39.170 --> 02:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
charging uh it's not necessary uh to
 
02:35:40.849 --> 02:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
present clear and convincing I would
 
02:35:44.750 --> 02:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
argue that it would certainly be
 
02:35:47.570 --> 02:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate for preponderance level of
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
evidence which is 51 or more as opposed
 
02:35:53.150 --> 02:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
to clear and convincing clear and
 
02:35:55.210 --> 02:35:55.220 align:start position:0%
convincing sits somewhere between
 
02:35:58.130 --> 02:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
preponderant evidence at 51 percent and
 
02:36:01.130 --> 02:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
proof Beyond A Reasonable Doubt and so
 
02:36:04.309 --> 02:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
in a charging situation right it's
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate to charge at the
 
02:36:08.090 --> 02:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
preponderant level and of course it's up
 
02:36:10.610 --> 02:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
to the courts to decide whether or not
 
02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
that is sufficient in that case clear
 
02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
and convincing in my experience
 
02:36:17.389 --> 02:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the Judiciary blurs that
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
line in favor of proof Beyond A
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt between clear and
 
02:36:23.690 --> 02:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
convincing so I think it presents a
 
02:36:26.750 --> 02:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
particular higher hurdle for the County
 
02:36:30.110 --> 02:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys to be able to overcome when
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're at clear and convincing and again
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're not at the conviction stage we're
 
02:36:39.170 --> 02:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:51.530 --> 02:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:53.450 --> 02:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
02:36:56.389 --> 02:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
name is Joe Ebert it's ebirt I'm a major
 
02:36:57.889 --> 02:36:57.899 align:start position:0%
with the state police I oversee the
 
02:36:59.870 --> 02:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services Bureau which is
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
your state police detectives uh so I'm
 
02:37:05.150 --> 02:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
keenly aware of the proximity of my
 
02:37:06.889 --> 02:37:06.899 align:start position:0%
testimony and your ability to go to
 
02:37:09.290 --> 02:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
lunch so I will keep this very brief
 
02:37:11.570 --> 02:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh however
 
02:37:13.969 --> 02:37:13.979 align:start position:0%
um so I did want to start by addressing
 
02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
something that representative Harry uh
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
gatwright uh brought up and it uh it
 
02:37:20.870 --> 02:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
dealt in assaults and whether or not
 
02:37:22.429 --> 02:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
they're taking a play uh taking place
 
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
across the state so I can speak from uh
 
02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
my own experience having uh been
 
02:37:28.969 --> 02:37:28.979 align:start position:0%
assigned to troop F which is our
 
02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
northernmost troop and Troop a which is
 
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
one of our southernmost troops uh and
 
02:37:35.210 --> 02:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
I've certainly seen assaults
 
02:37:37.550 --> 02:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately throughout my career uh
 
02:37:39.650 --> 02:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
both from uh right from the top of the
 
02:37:41.150 --> 02:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh the state of New Hampshire all the
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
way down so I do
 
02:37:46.130 --> 02:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
um I sit before you today in support of
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
this bill uh on behalf of the State
 
02:37:49.969 --> 02:37:49.979 align:start position:0%
Police and I say that I think I would be
 
02:37:53.090 --> 02:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
remiss if I didn't come before you and
 
02:37:55.690 --> 02:37:55.700 align:start position:0%
offer support of a bill that may deter
 
02:37:58.730 --> 02:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
a fellow Trooper officer or first
 
02:38:01.610 --> 02:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
responder for being assaulted so as in
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
in regard to the uh the first portion of
 
02:38:05.630 --> 02:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
this bill we are certainly in support of
 
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
the enhanced penalty
 
02:38:09.230 --> 02:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to do though was address
 
02:38:11.630 --> 02:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
something that I don't think has been
 
02:38:13.849 --> 02:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
addressed in great detail which is the
 
02:38:15.530 --> 02:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
last paragraph of the bill and it deals
 
02:38:17.950 --> 02:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
with knowingly reporting
 
02:38:20.570 --> 02:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
false allegations false and baseless
 
02:38:22.910 --> 02:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
allegations about law enforcement
 
02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to touch on that because
 
02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
there is as one of the prior speakers
 
02:38:30.770 --> 02:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
had remarked there is a heightened sense
 
02:38:33.650 --> 02:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
of judgment and scrutiny on law
 
02:38:36.770 --> 02:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement and there should be and we
 
02:38:39.469 --> 02:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely should have that and
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
as an agency we are incredibly
 
02:38:43.849 --> 02:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
supportive of that notion
 
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
however I do I think that we uh with
 
02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:48.710 align:start position:0%
however I do I think that we uh with
that

02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:51.010 --> 02:38:51.020 align:start position:0%
heightened sense of scrutiny we bear
 
02:38:55.090 --> 02:38:55.100 align:start position:0%
certain uh penalties that are not
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're not present in other
 
02:39:01.070 --> 02:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
professions so for example
 
02:39:04.010 --> 02:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
if somebody makes an allegation that
 
02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
you've committed a crime you may be
 
02:39:09.469 --> 02:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
suspended suspended without pay this may
 
02:39:11.330 --> 02:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
affect your health insurance this may
 
02:39:14.270 --> 02:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
affect your uh your pay your ability to
 
02:39:15.730 --> 02:39:15.740 align:start position:0%
pay your mortgage
 
02:39:19.370 --> 02:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
and these things are acceptable as long
 
02:39:24.170 --> 02:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
as the allegation is based in Merit if
 
02:39:25.969 --> 02:39:25.979 align:start position:0%
it's not based in Merit it was done out
 
02:39:27.309 --> 02:39:27.319 align:start position:0%
of malice
 
02:39:30.349 --> 02:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's an incredibly difficult situation
 
02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
for someone to go through
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to start on just these the
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
lowest level of allegation where
 
02:39:38.809 --> 02:39:38.819 align:start position:0%
somebody says on the side of the road uh
 
02:39:40.610 --> 02:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
you know this individual this Trooper
 
02:39:42.410 --> 02:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
when they stopped me they yelled at me
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh they yelled at me in front of my
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
child and they swore at me and it was it
 
02:39:49.730 --> 02:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
was egregious it was outrageous I
 
02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be treated like this
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
so the complaint comes in and the first
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
thing that we typically do now is we
 
02:39:58.910 --> 02:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
will watch the the body camera footage
 
02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
and none of that takes place none of
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
that it's a relatively cordial uh
 
02:40:07.730 --> 02:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
interaction their issue to summons and
 
02:40:11.090 --> 02:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
away they go the outcome of that
 
02:40:13.309 --> 02:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
complaint is a letter that goes back to
 
02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
the individual that says your complaint
 
02:40:16.990 --> 02:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
is unfounded and I will tell you from
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
sitting on the other side of complaints
 
02:40:23.690 --> 02:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
like that that's a difficult pill to
 
02:40:27.290 --> 02:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
swallow if I were to have said the exact
 
02:40:30.889 --> 02:40:30.899 align:start position:0%
same thing during that stop that this
 
02:40:33.889 --> 02:40:33.899 align:start position:0%
was said uh that it was done in a way
 
02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
that was uh unprofessional and
 
02:40:38.450 --> 02:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
outrageous and it was found that I was
 
02:40:41.210 --> 02:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
lying uh I think clearly I would be held
 
02:40:44.929 --> 02:40:44.939 align:start position:0%
responsible at a much greater uh to much
 
02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
greater detriment so uh what I'm saying
 
02:40:51.230 --> 02:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
in that uh in a microcosm there is
 
02:40:53.210 --> 02:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
if there is no
 
02:40:55.370 --> 02:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh personal responsibility for somebody
 
02:40:57.410 --> 02:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
making an allegation
 
02:40:59.450 --> 02:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
then there's no prohibition for that
 
02:41:01.550 --> 02:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
person to do it they don't have that
 
02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
second thought in their mind that okay I
 
02:41:05.090 --> 02:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
can make this allegation because what's
 
02:41:07.250 --> 02:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
the worst that can happen nothing
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
as it relates to a criminal allegation I
 
02:41:12.110 --> 02:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
talked to you a little bit about uh what
 
02:41:14.210 --> 02:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
happens when somebody makes a criminal
 
02:41:15.710 --> 02:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
allegation against a member of law
 
02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement we would never want to chill
 
02:41:20.750 --> 02:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
the reporting process for that so if
 
02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
there is misconduct that is taking place
 
02:41:25.250 --> 02:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
and it is Criminal we absolutely want to
 
02:41:26.330 --> 02:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
if someone is making a criminal
 
02:41:30.050 --> 02:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
allegation against a member of law
 
02:41:32.570 --> 02:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement for anything other than the
 
02:41:35.330 --> 02:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
truth what I would suggest to you is
 
02:41:37.309 --> 02:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
there should be a repercussion for that
 
02:41:39.530 --> 02:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
if you make an allegation that is found
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
to be baseless and false that person
 
02:41:45.170 --> 02:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
should be held responsible for that so
 
02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh with that I thank you very much for
 
02:41:49.730 --> 02:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
your time today and I'm certainly
 
02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
available for any questions
 
02:41:54.889 --> 02:41:54.899 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:41:57.170 --> 02:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for not taking my question I I
 
02:41:58.910 --> 02:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
just listened to you carefully to your
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
testimony and there should be a penalty
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
um do you think um well could you just
 
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
explain your reasoning
 
02:42:08.690 --> 02:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
if you do think this that that it
 
02:42:11.570 --> 02:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
warrants a felony charge as opposed to
 
02:42:14.270 --> 02:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
maybe the language that says a
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for the first time and then
 
02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
and then for this goes jumps to a felony
 
02:42:21.290 --> 02:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
could it be a Class A misdemeanor that
 
02:42:24.530 --> 02:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
has both fines and jail time potentially
 
02:42:26.090 --> 02:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
available for it
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much representative
 
02:42:29.450 --> 02:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
Newman for the question uh this is
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
something I considered greatly before I
 
02:42:33.230 --> 02:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
came in and uh spoke this morning so I'm
 
02:42:36.650 --> 02:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to opine on that I
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's the
 
02:42:40.370 --> 02:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
position of the state to believe uh
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
State Police to say whether or not this
 
02:42:44.809 --> 02:42:44.819 align:start position:0%
should be a felony or a misdemeanor I
 
02:42:46.910 --> 02:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
think that's really something that uh
 
02:42:49.370 --> 02:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
the legislature should contemplate and
 
02:42:51.469 --> 02:42:51.479 align:start position:0%
and come to an agreement on if if the
 
02:42:53.090 --> 02:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
bill moves forward
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
um what I would tell you is I
 
02:42:59.389 --> 02:42:59.399 align:start position:0%
I certainly had pause at the notion that
 
02:43:01.690 --> 02:43:01.700 align:start position:0%
somebody would be convicted of a felony
 
02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
because it's it comes with such serious
 
02:43:08.030 --> 02:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
consequences for that individual
 
02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:08.630 align:start position:0%
consequences for that individual
um

02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
but I tried to balance that against the
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
very serious consequences that law
 
02:43:16.130 --> 02:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer may also undergo for
 
02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
a baseless claim so I I submit that to
 
02:43:22.130 --> 02:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
you for further discussion amongst
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
yourselves at a later date but we are
 
02:43:25.849 --> 02:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
certainly in favor of people being held
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
responsible but in terms of the level
 
02:43:30.770 --> 02:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
which they are held responsible we would
 
02:43:35.090 --> 02:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
not suggest a a level of crime thank you
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:46.010 align:start position:0%
 
nice

representative Lauren selig representing

Durham which is Stratford 10. and I am
 
03:34:57.050 --> 03:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill in the absence of
 
03:35:00.050 --> 03:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
the person who presented it Bill 549 FN
 
03:35:02.570 --> 03:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
relative to the definition of domestic
 
03:35:02.580 --> 03:35:03.590 align:start position:0%
relative to the definition of domestic
violence

03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
violence
 
03:35:05.750 --> 03:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
this bill expands the definition of
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
abuse to include acts of financial abuse
 
03:35:10.370 --> 03:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
and domestic violence
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:18.650 --> 03:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:24.349 --> 03:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:54.190 --> 03:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:56.090 --> 03:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
03:35:58.250 --> 03:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to repeat what I just
 
03:35:58.260 --> 03:35:59.630 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to repeat what I just
said

03:35:59.630 --> 03:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:36:02.030 --> 03:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and for 20 years I've been on the
 
03:36:03.650 --> 03:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
domestic violence fatality Review
 
03:36:06.349 --> 03:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
Committee but most of my work at this
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
point is as a criminal defense lawyer
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
I'm a member and past president of the
 
03:36:12.170 --> 03:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of criminal
 
03:36:13.729 --> 03:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers but in doing that I
 
03:36:16.250 --> 03:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
represent both plaintiffs and defendants
 
03:36:20.290 --> 03:36:20.300 align:start position:0%
in domestic violence and stalking cases
 
03:36:23.330 --> 03:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
we do not doubt the good intention of
 
03:36:24.429 --> 03:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
but it raises a set of concerns
 
03:36:32.990 --> 03:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
some Provisions unwise some unworkable
 
03:36:36.170 --> 03:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
and some unnecessary so I'm going to go
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
through a couple of the provisions
 
03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
quickly and of course be prepared to
 
03:36:42.530 --> 03:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
03:36:46.790 --> 03:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
so the first provision letter I which is
 
03:36:49.610 --> 03:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
talking about financial abuse includes
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
the provision hiding assets
 
03:36:55.490 --> 03:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
remember that this statute applies to
 
03:36:58.190 --> 03:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
both married individuals and unmarried
 
03:37:01.790 --> 03:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
individuals who are involved in a
 
03:37:05.090 --> 03:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
relationship but there's a choice to go
 
03:37:07.309 --> 03:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
to court for a protective order
 
03:37:10.010 --> 03:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
so in if I was in a two-month
 
03:37:14.090 --> 03:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
relationship unmarried and my partner
 
03:37:16.809 --> 03:37:16.819 align:start position:0%
said so tell me about your bank account
 
03:37:20.630 --> 03:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
or tell me about your 401k and I
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
declined to do that
 
03:37:25.910 --> 03:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
arguably that is hiding Assets Now again
 
03:37:28.729 --> 03:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
the issues that this bill seeks to
 
03:37:31.849 --> 03:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
address were sympathetic to but the
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
wording of the bill broadens this in an
 
03:37:37.429 --> 03:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
extraordinary and I believe unintended
 
03:37:37.439 --> 03:37:38.990 align:start position:0%
extraordinary and I believe unintended
way

03:37:38.990 --> 03:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:37:43.010 --> 03:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
if a wife chose to hide assets from a
 
03:37:45.229 --> 03:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
husband because she wants to leave
 
03:37:48.290 --> 03:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
part of her exit plan is to create two
 
03:37:52.130 --> 03:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
months rent and so is not telling her
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
spouse about that bank account she is
 
03:37:58.010 --> 03:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
hiding assets and this legislation
 
03:38:01.250 --> 03:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
defines that she is involved in an act
 
03:38:03.250 --> 03:38:03.260 align:start position:0%
of abuse
 
03:38:07.510 --> 03:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
if you go to i-6 that's refusing
 
03:38:10.790 --> 03:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
reducing or refusing access to funds for
 
03:38:13.969 --> 03:38:13.979 align:start position:0%
daily living again if you're dealing
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
with an unmarried couple there's no
 
03:38:19.790 --> 03:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
legal responsibility of support but
 
03:38:22.490 --> 03:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
because of the way this bill is written
 
03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
the statute expands that duty of support
 
03:38:30.170 --> 03:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
to unmarried individuals and if one
 
03:38:35.210 --> 03:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
partner is refusing access to funds the
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
other partner can say under the wording
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
of the statute that it's abuse to seek a
 
03:38:43.090 --> 03:38:43.100 align:start position:0%
protective order
 
03:38:46.670 --> 03:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph I ate dissipating or hiding
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
Assets in anticipation of a divorce
 
03:38:52.429 --> 03:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
first off the easiest thing is to go to
 
03:38:55.190 --> 03:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
divorce to to file a divorce because
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
when a divorce petition is filed there's
 
03:39:01.250 --> 03:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
a specific provision in every case that
 
03:39:04.910 --> 03:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
bars hypothecating or hiding funds so
 
03:39:09.650 --> 03:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
this is an anticipatory issue and not
 
03:39:12.170 --> 03:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
workable because it's not the case that
 
03:39:14.750 --> 03:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
every spouse knows that the divorce
 
03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
petition is about to come
 
03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
so it becomes a proof issue and a little
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
bit of a nightmare for the court system
 
03:39:25.010 --> 03:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
to find out when is it that you told
 
03:39:26.929 --> 03:39:26.939 align:start position:0%
your spouse that you were going to seek
 
03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
the divorce and it was like well only
 
03:39:33.229 --> 03:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
after filing so there are real practical
 
03:39:36.349 --> 03:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
issues in regard to this
 
03:39:39.290 --> 03:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
additionally these Financial issues are
 
03:39:41.809 --> 03:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
typically dealt with within the context
 
03:39:44.809 --> 03:39:44.819 align:start position:0%
of a divorce pretty extensive discovery
 
03:39:46.910 --> 03:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
which involves both interrogatories and
 
03:39:49.729 --> 03:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
depositions that's never going to occur
 
03:39:52.729 --> 03:39:52.739 align:start position:0%
within the 30-weight day window as you
 
03:39:54.410 --> 03:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
may know in a protective order case
 
03:39:57.650 --> 03:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
there can be a an ex-party order the
 
03:39:59.929 --> 03:39:59.939 align:start position:0%
final order is then by Statute within 30
 
03:40:02.750 --> 03:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
days it is unrealistic for the court
 
03:40:04.729 --> 03:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
system to manage the issue of
 
03:40:07.429 --> 03:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
interrogatories and depositions within
 
03:40:09.530 --> 03:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
that window
 
03:40:09.540 --> 03:40:11.229 align:start position:0%
that window
um

03:40:11.229 --> 03:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:15.309 --> 03:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
the I'm gonna go skip to paragraph j4
 
03:40:17.870 --> 03:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
interference with work such that a job
 
03:40:20.870 --> 03:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
is lost if somebody loses their job it
 
03:40:22.490 --> 03:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
then makes it a proof issue for the
 
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
court system the family court to listen
 
03:40:29.090 --> 03:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
to the terms of uh the termination
 
03:40:31.729 --> 03:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
potentially imposing on the employer the
 
03:40:34.010 --> 03:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
need to come in and speak of the work
 
03:40:36.769 --> 03:40:36.779 align:start position:0%
history of the plaintiff which may be
 
03:40:36.779 --> 03:40:38.150 align:start position:0%
history of the plaintiff which may be
mixed

03:40:38.150 --> 03:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
mixed
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
um paragraph J2 depriving family or
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
household members of basic necessities
 
03:40:46.570 --> 03:40:46.580 align:start position:0%
again it broadens the scope of financial
 
03:40:49.610 --> 03:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to non-mary Partners
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
and seemingly imposes a duty of support
 
03:40:55.490 --> 03:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
that does not now exist under New
 
03:40:56.929 --> 03:40:56.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
03:41:00.410 --> 03:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
in terms of the unnecessary paragraph J5
 
03:41:02.990 --> 03:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
references cruelty to animals that's
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
already within the domestic violence
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
statute itself at 173 B1 Roman numeral
 
03:41:14.809 --> 03:41:14.819 align:start position:0%
1H also j6 references for sex acts
 
03:41:18.490 --> 03:41:18.500 align:start position:0%
that's also already covered by 173 B1
 
03:41:22.010 --> 03:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
that's paragraph one
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
C so it's a combination as I indicated
 
03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
to air view things that are unwise
 
03:41:32.450 --> 03:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
things that are unworkable things that
 
03:41:33.969 --> 03:41:33.979 align:start position:0%
are unnecessary
 
03:41:36.590 --> 03:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
to have the family court deal with
 
03:41:39.469 --> 03:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
financial issues over this shortened
 
03:41:41.269 --> 03:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
time frame which they do not typically
 
03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
do will create a morass to our view with
 
03:41:46.630 --> 03:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
the court system
 
03:41:49.030 --> 03:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
it creates
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
enormous burdens for the family court a
 
03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
court that is as I'm going to guess you
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
know already overburdened I'm aware of a
 
03:41:58.190 --> 03:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
case yesterday where a family court
 
03:42:00.530 --> 03:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
judge said I stay till 8 o'clock every
 
03:42:00.540 --> 03:42:01.490 align:start position:0%
judge said I stay till 8 o'clock every
night

03:42:01.490 --> 03:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
night
 
03:42:04.429 --> 03:42:04.439 align:start position:0%
trying to work on my caseload I just
 
03:42:07.610 --> 03:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
can't do more and for this statute to
 
03:42:09.349 --> 03:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
add to the burdens of the family court
 
03:42:12.889 --> 03:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
we think is unnecessary and unwise
 
03:42:14.690 --> 03:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
I see the chairman nodding so I'm going
 
03:42:16.610 --> 03:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
to finish and say thank you
 
03:42:20.570 --> 03:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
if I if I may ask a question or to
 
03:42:20.580 --> 03:42:21.950 align:start position:0%
if I if I may ask a question or to
myself

03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
myself
 
03:42:21.960 --> 03:42:22.969 align:start position:0%
myself
um

03:42:22.969 --> 03:42:22.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:26.030 --> 03:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
under the existing statute if you have
 
03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
representing a defendant and there's a
 
03:42:29.929 --> 03:42:29.939 align:start position:0%
no contact order
 
03:42:32.690 --> 03:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
does the current order provide for no
 
03:42:35.330 --> 03:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
contact through a third party
 
03:42:39.050 --> 03:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
it could provide for no contact with
 
03:42:42.769 --> 03:42:42.779 align:start position:0%
children but because third parties a
 
03:42:45.530 --> 03:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
brother sister not a party to the case
 
03:42:47.870 --> 03:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't apply to brother sister
 
03:42:50.929 --> 03:42:50.939 align:start position:0%
parent what I meant was
 
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
um in other words I can't pass if if I
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
have order against me not to contact you
 
03:42:58.309 --> 03:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
I can't have representative man you pass
 
03:42:59.690 --> 03:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
it to you without violating the order
 
03:43:02.690 --> 03:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
correct so that would also apply to work
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
if I were to go to your employer and and
 
03:43:06.769 --> 03:43:06.779 align:start position:0%
do something that would cause you to be
 
03:43:08.450 --> 03:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
in trouble isn't that could that be cons
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
considered contact to the third party
 
03:43:13.250 --> 03:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
already it it could and the difficulty
 
03:43:15.889 --> 03:43:15.899 align:start position:0%
with this also on a practical level is
 
03:43:17.630 --> 03:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
because it involves Financial issues
 
03:43:20.150 --> 03:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's saying there is no contact but
 
03:43:22.429 --> 03:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
there'd be this enormous need to discuss
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
finances correct but it's barred by the
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
statute and my last question is does the
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
current order system not already provide
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
a place for emergency financial support
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
ordered in the order it can
 
03:43:39.710 --> 03:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
in in Candor and a majority of the cases
 
03:43:41.690 --> 03:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
it's not done because these are
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
expedited hearings focusing on contact
 
03:43:46.130 --> 03:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
as opposed to full financial planning
 
03:43:47.809 --> 03:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
the permanent order
 
03:43:49.969 --> 03:43:49.979 align:start position:0%
permanent order is a one-year order can
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
be renewed for a five-year window
 
03:43:56.630 --> 03:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
um in married partner cases it most
 
03:43:59.150 --> 03:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
typically is a divorce where these
 
03:44:03.170 --> 03:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
things are settled on a permanent basis
 
03:44:05.150 --> 03:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
03:44:07.070 --> 03:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have a quick question I I
 
03:44:08.990 --> 03:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
believe you said that the that the
 
03:44:10.190 --> 03:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
shortened time frame would have an
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.389 --> 03:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry could you just point out
 
03:44:20.210 --> 03:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
where what language in the bill does
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
that so the statute provides for final
 
03:44:26.990 --> 03:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
hearings within 30 days
 
03:44:28.429 --> 03:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
um so when I'm talking about that short
 
03:44:30.410 --> 03:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
and time period trying to deal with
 
03:44:32.210 --> 03:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
financial issues which are ordinarily
 
03:44:34.490 --> 03:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
the subject of Discovery it would be
 
03:44:35.929 --> 03:44:35.939 align:start position:0%
very difficult to get all that
 
03:44:38.510 --> 03:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
accomplished within the 30 days but the
 
03:44:41.450 --> 03:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
statute itself provides for a 30-day
 
03:44:43.370 --> 03:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
window from a
 
03:44:45.889 --> 03:44:45.899 align:start position:0%
for a final hearing the defendant can
 
03:44:48.170 --> 03:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
ask for an expedited hearing which by
 
03:44:51.050 --> 03:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
Statute must occur within five days
 
03:44:55.130 --> 03:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:56.990 --> 03:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Selleck
 
03:44:58.910 --> 03:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you attorney cronon
 
03:45:00.530 --> 03:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:45:02.990 --> 03:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
um so I understand that you're saying
 
03:45:04.250 --> 03:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is written makes
 
03:45:07.010 --> 03:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
addressing Financial issues challenging
 
03:45:10.849 --> 03:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if you can identify if
 
03:45:13.969 --> 03:45:13.979 align:start position:0%
someone is in fact using finances as
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
their method of abuse you know say
 
03:45:19.010 --> 03:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
cutting off credit cards and all other
 
03:45:23.050 --> 03:45:23.060 align:start position:0%
Financial assets for one party member
 
03:45:26.150 --> 03:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
how does that get addressed Within
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh within this structure or within the
 
03:45:31.309 --> 03:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
structure of domestic violence so most
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
typically those are married couples and
 
03:45:37.490 --> 03:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
the way to deal with it is by filing a
 
03:45:40.849 --> 03:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
divorce petition which allows both a
 
03:45:43.790 --> 03:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
temporary order for support most
 
03:45:45.530 --> 03:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
typically those temporary orders focus
 
03:45:47.570 --> 03:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
on child support as well if kids are
 
03:45:47.580 --> 03:45:48.790 align:start position:0%
on child support as well if kids are
involved

03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
involved
 
03:45:51.889 --> 03:45:51.899 align:start position:0%
it becomes murkier if it's a childless
 
03:45:55.190 --> 03:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
couple as to what that financial support
 
03:45:57.769 --> 03:45:57.779 align:start position:0%
looks like the focus most typically is
 
03:46:01.010 --> 03:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
on housing and a court order as to who
 
03:46:02.990 --> 03:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
is going to live in the house or
 
03:46:05.630 --> 03:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
apartment and who pays the expenses for
 
03:46:05.640 --> 03:46:06.349 align:start position:0%
apartment and who pays the expenses for
that

03:46:06.349 --> 03:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:46:10.910 --> 03:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
for unmarried people it
 
03:46:13.130 --> 03:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
there there isn't because there's no
 
03:46:15.410 --> 03:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
legal connection between unmarried
 
03:46:17.229 --> 03:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
people in terms of Duties to support
 
03:46:21.050 --> 03:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
there isn't typically a good way to deal
 
03:46:22.670 --> 03:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
with it other than ending the
 
03:46:22.680 --> 03:46:26.809 align:start position:0%
with it other than ending the
relationship

03:46:26.809 --> 03:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:28.250 --> 03:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:28.260 --> 03:46:29.690 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:46:29.690 --> 03:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:33.229 --> 03:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
in some case that I've experienced
 
03:46:33.239 --> 03:46:33.830 align:start position:0%
in some case that I've experienced
um

03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
the abusive partner who may have been
 
03:46:39.290 --> 03:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
verbally abusive for an extended period
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
has withheld has figured out ways of
 
03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
withholding all finances from the other
 
03:46:44.279 --> 03:46:45.290 align:start position:0%
withholding all finances from the other
partner

03:46:45.290 --> 03:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
partner
 
03:46:48.050 --> 03:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
so that they then have no ability to get
 
03:46:51.050 --> 03:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
sustenance or any other provision and so
 
03:46:52.849 --> 03:46:52.859 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the only way that
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
they would be able to address that would
 
03:46:55.490 --> 03:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
be to go through divorce proceedings
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
that there's no aspect of the abuse laws
 
03:47:00.170 --> 03:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
that would protect them in those cases
 
03:47:02.090 --> 03:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
if they're unmarried they they can't use
 
03:47:05.750 --> 03:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
that would be the typical easiest way to
 
03:47:12.170 --> 03:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
do it because it creates a separation it
 
03:47:14.450 --> 03:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
can create protection within the divorce
 
03:47:16.670 --> 03:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
statute itself there is also an ability
 
03:47:19.729 --> 03:47:19.739 align:start position:0%
to get a protective order so while you
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
can choose to get a protective order as
 
03:47:23.630 --> 03:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
a married couple
 
03:47:28.250 --> 03:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
now and go do a divorce later it's also
 
03:47:31.010 --> 03:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
possible to do to just go forward with a
 
03:47:32.990 --> 03:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
divorce and seek a protective order
 
03:47:39.250 --> 03:47:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:45.290 --> 03:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:55.130 --> 03:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:56.929 --> 03:47:56.939 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:47:59.210 --> 03:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
it's been a long day uh my name is Joe
 
03:48:00.769 --> 03:48:00.779 align:start position:0%
Hannon I'm with governors of New
 
03:48:03.429 --> 03:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh I want to keep my
 
03:48:06.290 --> 03:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
comments it's a very narrow part of what
 
03:48:07.309 --> 03:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
this would affect it would actually
 
03:48:10.010 --> 03:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
impact a person's uh Firearms rights and
 
03:48:12.530 --> 03:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
able to own them uh obviously you're
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
aware that under 173 B section 4 and
 
03:48:18.769 --> 03:48:18.779 align:start position:0%
relief for any type of abuse which this
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
would expand the definition of if they
 
03:48:22.610 --> 03:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
could lose someone's Firearms rights uh
 
03:48:24.769 --> 03:48:24.779 align:start position:0%
temporarily or even extended periods of
 
03:48:26.510 --> 03:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
time if they're if they are convicted of
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
anything so
 
03:48:30.530 --> 03:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of that was obviously to
 
03:48:33.229 --> 03:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
keep uh Firearms other deadly weapons
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
away from someone who was a immediate
 
03:48:39.950 --> 03:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
and present danger for abuse to the
 
03:48:43.190 --> 03:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
petitioner I don't see how many of the
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
things on this list would be considered
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
something that would constitute an
 
03:48:49.130 --> 03:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
immediate and present danger of abuse or
 
03:48:52.429 --> 03:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
have a potential cause for someone to
 
03:48:54.130 --> 03:48:54.140 align:start position:0%
fear for their safety and well-being
 
03:48:56.030 --> 03:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about something physical
 
03:48:58.190 --> 03:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
versus some other things that are
 
03:48:59.690 --> 03:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
obviously something needs to be
 
03:49:02.030 --> 03:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
addressed I'm not discussing why you
 
03:49:03.530 --> 03:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
know what these things need to be how
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
you can do them that's not my job today
 
03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
my job is to say that this would give a
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
huge opening for an area of infringement
 
03:49:14.150 --> 03:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
on rights that is is not necessary and
 
03:49:18.170 --> 03:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
um I just ask you to please rethink how
 
03:49:19.610 --> 03:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
it's going to be done and listing these
 
03:49:22.250 --> 03:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
under the domestic violence statute as
 
03:49:22.260 --> 03:49:24.050 align:start position:0%
under the domestic violence statute as
abuse

03:49:24.050 --> 03:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
03:49:26.210 --> 03:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
if you happen to take any questions
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
or just go sit down
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
representative Newman could you just say
 
03:49:33.110 --> 03:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
again where is the portion of the
 
03:49:35.210 --> 03:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
there's a portion of a bill that you say
 
03:49:38.150 --> 03:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
is a threat to uh the whole thing I mean
 
03:49:41.630 --> 03:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
if it becomes If This falls under uh the
 
03:49:44.090 --> 03:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
definition of abuse under abuse in a
 
03:49:47.530 --> 03:49:47.540 align:start position:0%
domestic violence statutes under uh 7 17
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
173 B4 under temporary relief someone
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
can lose their firearms uh and not just
 
03:49:56.150 --> 03:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
after a hearing or a conviction in an ex
 
03:49:57.889 --> 03:49:57.899 align:start position:0%
parte hearing so this is basically it
 
03:49:59.690 --> 03:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
would make like an expanded red flag
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
wall for someone to lose their firearms
 
03:50:04.010 --> 03:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
when they haven't done anything violent
 
03:50:05.389 --> 03:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
or to make someone fear for their
 
03:50:07.010 --> 03:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
physical safety or well-being now I'm
 
03:50:08.330 --> 03:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
not saying any of these things are good
 
03:50:10.190 --> 03:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
or shouldn't be addressed in the law but
 
03:50:11.570 --> 03:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
I think doing it under a specific
 
03:50:16.910 --> 03:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
definition of domestic abuse is is uh it
 
03:50:17.990 --> 03:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
will have a lot of unintended
 
03:50:19.370 --> 03:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
consequences and it would actually
 
03:50:20.809 --> 03:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
infringe on people's rights and it would
 
03:50:22.490 --> 03:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
be cons it's a constitutional issue if
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about taking someone's uh
 
03:50:26.929 --> 03:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights away for a
 
03:50:29.030 --> 03:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
non-violent crime that they would have
 
03:50:31.250 --> 03:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
been haven't even been convicted of and
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's no danger to anyone else thank
 
03:50:33.600 --> 03:50:36.889 align:start position:0%
there's no danger to anyone else thank
you

03:50:36.889 --> 03:50:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:00.590 --> 03:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Kurt Ehrenberg the

committee
 
03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
for recognizing and including in the
 
03:51:11.279 --> 03:51:12.590 align:start position:0%
for recognizing and including in the
legislation

03:51:12.590 --> 03:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:51:12.600 --> 03:51:14.210 align:start position:0%
legislation
uh

03:51:14.210 --> 03:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:17.450 --> 03:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
animals and abuse of animals as a
 
03:51:17.460 --> 03:51:19.130 align:start position:0%
animals and abuse of animals as a
precursor

03:51:19.130 --> 03:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
precursor
 
03:51:21.790 --> 03:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
which is a well-known and
 
03:51:25.490 --> 03:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
studied proven
 
03:51:28.969 --> 03:51:28.979 align:start position:0%
very telling precursor of domestic
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
violence so including this in this
 
03:51:31.439 --> 03:51:32.750 align:start position:0%
violence so including this in this

legislation
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
is a terrific situation we were really
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
happy to see that the more that people
 
03:51:40.250 --> 03:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
think about
 
03:51:43.130 --> 03:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
uh the abuse of animals as a precursor
 
03:51:45.889 --> 03:51:45.899 align:start position:0%
to all kinds of violence in our society
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
and one thing that we're trying to
 
03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
Foster in this state is uh better Animal
 
03:51:54.650 --> 03:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
control officer protocols and things
 
03:51:57.229 --> 03:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
like that which you may see at some
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
point in this committee but I appreciate

03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
this bill was drafted by representative
 
03:52:14.570 --> 03:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
testerman we're just going to decide on
 
03:52:16.250 --> 03:52:16.260 align:start position:0%

and we do support the bill as it is
 
03:52:25.849 --> 03:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the comments we've heard
 
03:52:29.150 --> 03:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:45.550 --> 03:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:48.229 --> 03:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
03:52:50.150 --> 03:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Pamela kylig and I
 
03:52:51.889 --> 03:52:51.899 align:start position:0%
am the public policy specialist at the
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition against Domestic
 
03:52:56.330 --> 03:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
and Sexual Violence which I think many
 
03:52:58.729 --> 03:52:58.739 align:start position:0%
of you know is the umbrella Organization
 
03:53:00.530 --> 03:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
for our 12 community-based crisis
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
centers I'm here to speak today on HB
 
03:53:06.349 --> 03:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
549 as you've heard legislation that
 
03:53:07.969 --> 03:53:07.979 align:start position:0%
seeks to change our state's definition
 
03:53:10.070 --> 03:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence we'll try to keep
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
it brief today
 
03:53:13.010 --> 03:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
um we really appreciate the sponsor's
 
03:53:16.849 --> 03:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
interests in examining ways that we can
 
03:53:19.190 --> 03:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that nuanced and complex
 
03:53:22.070 --> 03:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
experiences of victims are recognized in
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases especially when
 
03:53:26.030 --> 03:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
victims are seeking life-saving services
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
like protective orders that were
 
03:53:30.530 --> 03:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned today there is no question
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
that Financial abuse and coercive
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
control are factors and many victims
 
03:53:37.309 --> 03:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
experiences and can contribute to that
 
03:53:39.530 --> 03:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
pattern of behavior that can lead to
 
03:53:42.110 --> 03:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
escalating violence however while the
 
03:53:44.210 --> 03:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
the Coalition supports the underlying
 
03:53:46.250 --> 03:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
principle of the bill we are hesitant to
 
03:53:48.769 --> 03:53:48.779 align:start position:0%
make any changes to the statute at this
 
03:53:51.229 --> 03:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
time we feel that the current definition
 
03:53:53.870 --> 03:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
is very comprehensive and we want to be
 
03:53:55.729 --> 03:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
extremely careful when it comes to
 
03:53:57.650 --> 03:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
considering any changes to existing law
 
03:53:59.090 --> 03:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
for some of the factors you've heard
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
today there's just a lot to consider and
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
I also just wanted to add that the
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
governor's commission is also on
 
03:54:08.450 --> 03:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
domestic violence sexual assault and
 
03:54:10.670 --> 03:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
stalking is planning to review and
 
03:54:13.729 --> 03:54:13.739 align:start position:0%
analyze this actual issue this summer as
 
03:54:16.370 --> 03:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
part of their agenda and we think that
 
03:54:18.349 --> 03:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
that's a great opportunity for a
 
03:54:20.090 --> 03:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary group of stakeholders
 
03:54:22.070 --> 03:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
to really look at this thoroughly and
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
determine what next steps might need to
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
be taken and we I can also I'd be happy
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
to share after any research from other
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
states who have also looked at taking on
 
03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
this issue there's been varied responses
 
03:54:38.269 --> 03:54:38.279 align:start position:0%
so again we just ask for more time and
 
03:54:40.250 --> 03:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
at this I would ask the committee to
 
03:54:42.530 --> 03:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
either consider retaining or even it
 
03:54:44.450 --> 03:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
yelling this bill just to give us more
 
03:54:46.250 --> 03:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
time thank you so much and I'd be happy
 
03:54:48.229 --> 03:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
to take questions
 
03:54:51.050 --> 03:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you could you address my earlier
 
03:54:54.170 --> 03:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
question regarding the finances if if a
 
03:54:55.490 --> 03:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
person seeks an order against someone
 
03:54:57.769 --> 03:54:57.779 align:start position:0%
else is it currently within the power of
 
03:54:59.570 --> 03:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
the court to issue a temporary support
 
03:55:02.090 --> 03:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
order as part of that restraining or
 
03:55:03.650 --> 03:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
protective order
 
03:55:05.030 --> 03:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
um and I might look to my colleague
 
03:55:05.040 --> 03:55:06.969 align:start position:0%
um and I might look to my colleague
attorney

03:55:06.969 --> 03:55:06.979 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
03:55:09.410 --> 03:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
okay I was afraid to hold it for him
 
03:55:12.650 --> 03:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
because yeah so I'm this is I would be
 
03:55:14.809 --> 03:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
happy to find the exact answer for you I
 
03:55:16.429 --> 03:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
know I'm not sure if you're referring to
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
Jade's law which allows a parent to take
 
03:55:22.130 --> 03:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
a restraining order out for a child or
 
03:55:24.769 --> 03:55:24.779 align:start position:0%
no I'm referring to whether or not when
 
03:55:26.830 --> 03:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
there's a hearing for a protective order
 
03:55:30.530 --> 03:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
if a judge has the ability to say okay
 
03:55:32.750 --> 03:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
this person is dependent upon you for
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
their so you need to continue paying x y
 
03:55:37.490 --> 03:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
and z Oh yes and then that would already
 
03:55:38.990 --> 03:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
be covered and it would be a violation
 
03:55:40.969 --> 03:55:40.979 align:start position:0%
if they did not do so yeah that's a
 
03:55:42.830 --> 03:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
great question and
 
03:55:46.550 --> 03:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I know that um oh it's complex so I
 
03:55:49.610 --> 03:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
think there's obviously there's divorce
 
03:55:51.349 --> 03:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
and parenting restraining orders and
 
03:55:53.630 --> 03:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
then there's protective orders and so in
 
03:55:55.849 --> 03:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
sort of the when and please someone else
 
03:55:57.290 --> 03:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong and I'd be happy
 
03:55:58.969 --> 03:55:58.979 align:start position:0%
to follow up as well but I think
 
03:56:01.729 --> 03:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there there's a lot of sort
 
03:56:03.830 --> 03:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
of checklists that judges go through to
 
03:56:05.929 --> 03:56:05.939 align:start position:0%
look at the circumstances involved and
 
03:56:08.090 --> 03:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
what you know if there's a child what
 
03:56:09.889 --> 03:56:09.899 align:start position:0%
adequate supports would need to be put
 
03:56:11.870 --> 03:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
in place so like the general question is
 
03:56:13.610 --> 03:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
I do believe there is something in place
 
03:56:16.849 --> 03:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
already I think maybe the intention here
 
03:56:18.769 --> 03:56:18.779 align:start position:0%
is just to recognize that sometimes
 
03:56:21.170 --> 03:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
there could be maybe by naming it
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
specifically there could be more weight
 
03:56:26.809 --> 03:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
on ensuring that that was considered but
 
03:56:29.210 --> 03:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
there are currently processes in places
 
03:56:31.309 --> 03:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
that can make that considerate or that
 
03:56:32.990 --> 03:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
judges have that discretion to consider
 
03:56:37.130 --> 03:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
that okay but because uh the previous
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
um the previous person's testimony uh
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
the attorney regarding the divorce side
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
of it and the domestic abuse side of it
 
03:56:45.950 --> 03:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
is well taken so I don't like mixing the
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
two of those so I'm interested if you
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
could find out if the domestic abuse
 
03:56:54.290 --> 03:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
side of it has the um the ability and if
 
03:56:57.530 --> 03:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
it's used to for them to order support
 
03:56:59.570 --> 03:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
of any kind yeah I can get a copy of
 
03:57:01.490 --> 03:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
that protective order I think that would
 
03:57:03.410 --> 03:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
clarify everything thank you thank you
 
03:57:06.530 --> 03:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
so much questions
 
03:57:08.150 --> 03:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:57:08.160 --> 03:57:11.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you

uh the chair recognizes Sergeant
 
03:57:14.279 --> 03:57:15.550 align:start position:0%
uh the chair recognizes Sergeant
Catherine

03:57:15.550 --> 03:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
Catherine
 
03:57:24.830 --> 03:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:27.290 --> 03:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
I'll try to write neither next time it
 
03:57:29.389 --> 03:57:29.399 align:start position:0%
is my name is Catherine shackford I'm a
 
03:57:30.590 --> 03:57:30.600 align:start position:0%

State Police
 
03:57:34.010 --> 03:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
um I actually don't have much else to
 
03:57:36.650 --> 03:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
add to what Pamela said
 
03:57:38.510 --> 03:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
um the state police is opposed to this
 
03:57:40.490 --> 03:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
bill as written and I think that she
 
03:57:43.130 --> 03:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
outlined uh some of the pertinent points
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
as well that that we would share we look
 
03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
forward to this issue being examined
 
03:57:50.570 --> 03:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
with the governor's Commission on
 
03:57:52.849 --> 03:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
domestic violence this summer in order
 
03:57:55.610 --> 03:57:55.620 align:start position:0%
to kind of look at these the specific
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
nuances of of a bill like this thank you
 
03:58:01.370 --> 03:58:01.380 align:start position:0%

03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
no thank you for your testimony thank
 
03:58:03.359 --> 03:58:05.570 align:start position:0%

03:58:07.370 --> 03:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
um the chair recognizes uh Richard head
 
03:58:14.510 --> 03:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:16.130 --> 03:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
03:58:17.330 --> 03:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Richard head
 
03:58:18.769 --> 03:58:18.779 align:start position:0%
I'm the government Affairs coordinator
 
03:58:20.809 --> 03:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch we have
 
03:58:23.389 --> 03:58:23.399 align:start position:0%
significant concerns about this bill
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
um as written and Echo the testimony
 
03:58:26.929 --> 03:58:26.939 align:start position:0%
that the governor's commission is
 
03:58:28.790 --> 03:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
intending to take up the def the the
 
03:58:32.210 --> 03:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
definition we do think it is best
 
03:58:35.689 --> 03:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
managed in a in a sort of extensive
 
03:58:38.929 --> 03:58:38.939 align:start position:0%
review both of how folks within New
 
03:58:40.370 --> 03:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would deal with it but also
 
03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
have these ideas been tested in other
 
03:58:45.070 --> 03:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
states how has it gone in other states
 
03:58:48.610 --> 03:58:48.620 align:start position:0%
and ultimately develop a better
 
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of exactly the the
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
positive and negative implications of
 
03:58:54.670 --> 03:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is written
 
03:58:57.710 --> 03:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
in a highly contested divorce a number
 
03:58:59.510 --> 03:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
of these items that you see on this list
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
would become domestic violence petitions
 
03:59:06.830 --> 03:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
too it becomes a it significantly has a
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
potential to significantly exacerbate a
 
03:59:12.469 --> 03:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
highly contested divorce case with
 
03:59:14.889 --> 03:59:14.899 align:start position:0%
regard to the chairs question
 
03:59:18.530 --> 03:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
a DV protective order can cover
 
03:59:22.070 --> 03:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
Financial it is not extensively used but
 
03:59:25.729 --> 03:59:25.739 align:start position:0%
the statutory reference is in 173 B4
 
03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
which is temporary relief lists sort of
 
03:59:30.050 --> 03:59:30.060 align:start position:0%
the items that can be in temporary
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
relief in and then there's sort of a a
 
03:59:35.870 --> 03:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
bit of a catch-all other so if there are
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
specific facts that support it and it's
 
03:59:41.450 --> 03:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
requested it would be a potential
 
03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:59:46.130 --> 03:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
add to a domestic violence or a
 
03:59:49.130 --> 03:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
protective order and with that I would
 
03:59:50.990 --> 03:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments but would be happy
 
03:59:53.090 --> 03:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
03:59:56.750 --> 03:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um so the the catch-all would
 
03:59:58.849 --> 03:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
would about today such as
 
03:59:58.859 --> 04:00:00.290 align:start position:0%
would about today such as
animals

04:00:00.290 --> 04:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
animals
 
04:00:02.210 --> 04:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
um credit cards that stuff would that be
 
04:00:03.889 --> 04:00:03.899 align:start position:0%
potentially available for the court to
 
04:00:05.630 --> 04:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
to make a ruling on
 
04:00:07.729 --> 04:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
it was the first one animals yeah so
 
04:00:10.010 --> 04:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
there is a line that says uh granting
 
04:00:12.110 --> 04:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
the petition or exclusive care custody
 
04:00:13.969 --> 04:00:13.979 align:start position:0%
or control of any animal owned possessed
 
04:00:15.889 --> 04:00:15.899 align:start position:0%
release by kept by the petitioner so
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's a specifically addressed item and
 
04:00:20.750 --> 04:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
then in the other relief it's other
 
04:00:23.090 --> 04:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
relief including but not limited to and
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
then has a couple there but in in one of
 
04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
them relates to business finances but it
 
04:00:28.910 --> 04:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
would also if there were personal
 
04:00:31.250 --> 04:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
finances at risk it would
 
04:00:33.229 --> 04:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
um it could be considered within the
 
04:00:35.630 --> 04:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
scope of of the protective order thank
 
04:00:38.150 --> 04:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
you questions
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you for your
 
04:00:41.450 --> 04:00:41.460 align:start position:0%

04:01:35.450 --> 04:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
it really is
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%

heard today
 
04:14:46.610 --> 04:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
um I believe that there's a committee in
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
um the process of looking at all these
 
04:14:51.410 --> 04:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
issues around domestic violence so

good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
of this committee my name is
 
04:17:14.929 --> 04:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
representative Sean filio and I have the
 
04:17:16.429 --> 04:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
privilege of serving the residents of
 
04:17:19.070 --> 04:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
Cheshire district 7 which covers Keane's
 
04:17:20.750 --> 04:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
Ward 2.
 
04:17:22.969 --> 04:17:22.979 align:start position:0%
I am here today to introduce House Bill
 
04:17:26.689 --> 04:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
315 which seeks to abolish the gay Panic
 
04:17:26.699 --> 04:17:27.889 align:start position:0%
315 which seeks to abolish the gay Panic
defense

04:17:27.889 --> 04:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
defense
 
04:17:30.170 --> 04:17:30.180 align:start position:0%
as procedural history
 
04:17:32.990 --> 04:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
this house passed a similar bill in 2022
 
04:17:35.630 --> 04:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
but it stalled in its high vote in the
 
04:17:36.769 --> 04:17:36.779 align:start position:0%
other chamber
 
04:17:39.410 --> 04:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
I now renew the effort to bring equal
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
dignity to all Granite Staters
 
04:17:46.370 --> 04:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
the gay Panic defense is a common law
 
04:17:49.010 --> 04:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
defense which allows a defendant to
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
argue that experiencing a victim's
 
04:17:56.450 --> 04:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
alleged same sex flirtation so overcame
 
04:17:59.090 --> 04:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
the defendant's delicate sensibilities
 
04:18:02.689 --> 04:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
that the defendant was provoked and
 
04:18:06.110 --> 04:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
in that agitated State murdered the
 
04:18:06.120 --> 04:18:07.309 align:start position:0%
in that agitated State murdered the
victim

04:18:07.309 --> 04:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
victim
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
this defense allows the murder charge to
 
04:18:11.929 --> 04:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
be downgraded to manslaughter which
 
04:18:14.570 --> 04:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
attracts a lesser sentence
 
04:18:16.250 --> 04:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
put another way
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
it says if a gay man hits on a straight
 
04:18:20.269 --> 04:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
man and
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
the straight man violently responds
 
04:18:25.490 --> 04:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
resulting in the gay man's death
 
04:18:27.950 --> 04:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
the straight man has the opportunity to
 
04:18:30.650 --> 04:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
argue his his murder charge should be
 
04:18:30.660 --> 04:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
argue his his murder charge should be
downgraded

04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
downgraded
 
04:18:37.790 --> 04:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
to be clear there is no straight Panic
 
04:18:37.800 --> 04:18:39.530 align:start position:0%
to be clear there is no straight Panic
defense

04:18:39.530 --> 04:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
defense
 
04:18:41.570 --> 04:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
that bears repeating
 
04:18:46.910 --> 04:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
there is no straight Panic defense
 
04:18:49.070 --> 04:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
if a man flirts with a woman
 
04:18:50.990 --> 04:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
and she doesn't like it
 
04:18:54.170 --> 04:18:54.180 align:start position:0%
she must respond in a rational adult
 
04:18:54.180 --> 04:18:55.729 align:start position:0%
she must respond in a rational adult
manner

04:18:55.729 --> 04:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
manner
 
04:18:57.410 --> 04:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
bite her lip
 
04:18:59.689 --> 04:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
and walk away
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
if she loses her temper and kills the
 
04:19:06.410 --> 04:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
man she must face the full consequences
 
04:19:11.809 --> 04:19:11.819 align:start position:0%
of the law as we expect of any citizen
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
there's no blaming the flirtations of
 
04:19:16.370 --> 04:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
the man for her conduct
 
04:19:16.380 --> 04:19:17.689 align:start position:0%
the man for her conduct
yet

04:19:17.689 --> 04:19:17.699 align:start position:0%
yet
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law points the finger at a
 
04:19:23.689 --> 04:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
gay victim for the similar situation and
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
says you're at fault your life isn't
 
04:19:28.319 --> 04:19:30.410 align:start position:0%
says you're at fault your life isn't
valuable

04:19:30.410 --> 04:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
the law
 
04:19:34.370 --> 04:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
ought not engage in this homophobic
 
04:19:38.090 --> 04:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
hateful victim blaming inherent to the
 
04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
gay Panic defense
 
04:19:43.849 --> 04:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
it is a moral Abomination which must now
 
04:19:47.269 --> 04:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
be left to the Wayside of History
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
and that's why 16 of our sister States
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
and the District of Columbia have
 
04:19:56.330 --> 04:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
already abolished the gay Panic defense
 
04:20:00.590 --> 04:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
it demeans the basic human dignity of
 
04:20:05.090 --> 04:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
lesbian gay bisexual transgendered queer
 
04:20:08.050 --> 04:20:08.060 align:start position:0%
and questioning people and blames
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
victims for their own demise
 
04:20:12.239 --> 04:20:13.550 align:start position:0%
victims for their own demise
further

04:20:13.550 --> 04:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:20:15.950 --> 04:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
all of our New England neighbors aside
 
04:20:18.370 --> 04:20:18.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts have abolished the defense
 
04:20:21.710 --> 04:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts looks poised to also
 
04:20:24.290 --> 04:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
abolish it this year
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
the American Bar Association in
 
04:20:26.880 --> 04:20:27.790 align:start position:0%
the American Bar Association in
resolution

04:20:27.790 --> 04:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
113A recommends all states abolish the
 
04:20:33.769 --> 04:20:33.779 align:start position:0%
gay Panic defense
 
04:20:35.450 --> 04:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
as stated by the American Bar
 
04:20:38.809 --> 04:20:38.819 align:start position:0%
Association quote the defense is not
 
04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
really a defense it is a tactic to
 
04:20:44.809 --> 04:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
strengthen a defense by playing on
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
Prejudice end quote
 
04:20:52.490 --> 04:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
it is a obvious miscarriage of Justice
 
04:20:54.969 --> 04:20:54.979 align:start position:0%
and the continued use of this
 
04:20:57.229 --> 04:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
anachronistic defense
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
marks an egregious lapse of our nation's
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
march to a more just criminal justice
 
04:21:03.720 --> 04:21:05.570 align:start position:0%
march to a more just criminal justice
system

04:21:05.570 --> 04:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:21:09.170 --> 04:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
I'll close with this chilling reminder
 
04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
in 1998
 
04:21:14.510 --> 04:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
in a bar similar to any bar you'd find
 
04:21:15.889 --> 04:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
in Durham
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
or Keen
 
04:21:19.550 --> 04:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
or Hanover
 
04:21:22.370 --> 04:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
a young gay college student made a
 
04:21:22.380 --> 04:21:24.050 align:start position:0%
a young gay college student made a
mistake

04:21:24.050 --> 04:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
he hid on some straight men believing
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
them to be gay it's an innocent mistake
 
04:21:33.710 --> 04:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
but these men played a cruel trick on
 
04:21:33.720 --> 04:21:34.849 align:start position:0%
but these men played a cruel trick on
him

04:21:34.849 --> 04:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
him
 
04:21:37.309 --> 04:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
they lured him down the road
 
04:21:39.290 --> 04:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
making him believe that they were
 
04:21:43.010 --> 04:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
interested but then once he was down the
 
04:21:44.030 --> 04:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
road away
 
04:21:47.269 --> 04:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
they savagely beat him
 
04:21:51.769 --> 04:21:51.779 align:start position:0%
hanging his beaten body on a fence post
 
04:21:55.490 --> 04:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
leaving him to die overnight
 
04:21:58.250 --> 04:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
their murder charge was downgraded to
 
04:22:02.090 --> 04:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
manslaughter using the gay Panic defense
 
04:22:05.210 --> 04:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
negating the basic Humanity of this
 
04:22:06.650 --> 04:22:06.660 align:start position:0%
young gay man
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
clearly I am talking about Matthew
 
04:22:09.000 --> 04:22:10.670 align:start position:0%
clearly I am talking about Matthew
Shepard

04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
Shepard
 
04:22:10.680 --> 04:22:13.130 align:start position:0%
Shepard
tonight

04:22:13.130 --> 04:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
in Manchester
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
or Hanover
 
04:22:19.070 --> 04:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
or Durham or Keen
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
the next Matthew Shepherd could happen
 
04:22:24.410 --> 04:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
due to the inaction of this body
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is better than that
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
we are better than that
 
04:22:31.849 --> 04:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're going to take
 
04:22:31.859 --> 04:22:32.870 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're going to take
action

04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:22:35.809 --> 04:22:35.819 align:start position:0%
join me and let's demonstrate to Granite
 
04:22:39.229 --> 04:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
Staters we value all lives
 
04:22:40.729 --> 04:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
I look forward to taking your questions
 
04:22:45.170 --> 04:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
as we protect every life in this state
 
04:22:47.870 --> 04:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony could you
 
04:22:49.309 --> 04:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
remind us what state was that Matthew
 
04:22:51.469 --> 04:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
Shepard incident happened that happened
 
04:22:54.769 --> 04:22:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:57.170 --> 04:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
just for the record you you had said at
 
04:22:59.769 --> 04:22:59.779 align:start position:0%
the outset that New Hampshire law
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
allows this it um it doesn't explicitly
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
allow it correctly it just doesn't ban
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
it uh correct it is common law that
 
04:23:10.070 --> 04:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
allows for this a common law defense is
 
04:23:13.130 --> 04:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
a uh defense that exists as a result of
 
04:23:15.469 --> 04:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
a Judicial precedent however it has not
 
04:23:17.450 --> 04:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
been affirmatively used in New Hampshire
 
04:23:19.370 --> 04:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
and we should take action before it is
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
affirmatively used in New Hampshire a
 
04:23:23.630 --> 04:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
final question for me as if you're aware
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
of it is there any Supreme Court rulings
 
04:23:27.769 --> 04:23:27.779 align:start position:0%
on this type of thing yet that we have
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
we heard any
 
04:23:30.410 --> 04:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question there is no
 
04:23:32.330 --> 04:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court ruling on this and
 
04:23:33.710 --> 04:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
there is no New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
04:23:35.450 --> 04:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
ruling however because it has been used
 
04:23:37.130 --> 04:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
in other states other states have
 
04:23:43.010 --> 04:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:49.969 --> 04:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:54.309 --> 04:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:57.530 --> 04:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
the case that you cited about the young
 
04:23:59.870 --> 04:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
man who was beaten to death
 
04:24:02.210 --> 04:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
were there any other circumstances that
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
would reduce that I mean can anyone take
 
04:24:09.849 --> 04:24:09.859 align:start position:0%
gay this gay Panic defense seriously
 
04:24:12.650 --> 04:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Andy I would
 
04:24:14.570 --> 04:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
agree that it's hard to imagine that
 
04:24:17.570 --> 04:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
this is necessary in 2023 that we are
 
04:24:19.969 --> 04:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
not placing equal dignity on all lives
 
04:24:23.630 --> 04:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
but the gay panicked offense was used
 
04:24:26.570 --> 04:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
that was the partial defense and that
 
04:24:29.110 --> 04:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
was the reason why it was downgraded
 
04:24:31.969 --> 04:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
indeed there are dozens of reported
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
cases across the country and that is why
 
04:24:37.490 --> 04:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
no lesser a group than the American Bar
 
04:24:39.830 --> 04:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
Association the leading group of
 
04:24:42.349 --> 04:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
attorneys the leading group of legal
 
04:24:44.050 --> 04:24:44.060 align:start position:0%
Minds in our country
 
04:24:48.110 --> 04:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
recommends every state abolish it and
 
04:24:50.090 --> 04:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
that is why our sister states are
 
04:24:53.090 --> 04:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
abolishing it it is used it is an
 
04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
Abomination and that's why we need to
 
04:24:57.530 --> 04:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
act and that's why this body voted to
 
04:25:02.090 --> 04:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.010 --> 04:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
there'd be no further questions thank
 
04:25:06.429 --> 04:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
what oh please
 
04:25:08.510 --> 04:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm sorry I was a
 
04:25:11.929 --> 04:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
little a little late on the reason we
 
04:25:14.689 --> 04:25:14.699 align:start position:0%
have so just to clarify
 
04:25:17.410 --> 04:25:17.420 align:start position:0%
um you know putting this into
 
04:25:20.830 --> 04:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
our legislature into our
 
04:25:25.130 --> 04:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
law is preempting if anything were to
 
04:25:27.290 --> 04:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
happen a situation like what happened in
 
04:25:27.300 --> 04:25:28.790 align:start position:0%
happen a situation like what happened in
Wyoming

04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
Wyoming
 
04:25:31.309 --> 04:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
um so rather than unnecessary it's
 
04:25:33.469 --> 04:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect in advance is that
 
04:25:34.550 --> 04:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
how you would
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
Define it I think you're representative
 
04:25:38.929 --> 04:25:38.939 align:start position:0%
yes this is a preemptive action which
 
04:25:41.570 --> 04:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
our state does many times that we are
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
preventing this from happening before it
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
is used
 
04:25:48.590 --> 04:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
we don't want a situation like this to
 
04:25:50.929 --> 04:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
occur we don't want somebody's life to
 
04:25:54.290 --> 04:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
be lost to a gay Panic defense type of
 
04:25:54.300 --> 04:25:55.490 align:start position:0%
be lost to a gay Panic defense type of
situation

04:25:55.490 --> 04:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:25:58.070 --> 04:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
we would prefer that an individual not
 
04:26:00.110 --> 04:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
lose their life or to have this defense
 
04:26:02.570 --> 04:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
be used which is again why other states
 
04:26:05.210 --> 04:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
have abolished this defense before it is
 
04:26:06.649 --> 04:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
used there
 
04:26:08.269 --> 04:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has been on Leading Edge
 
04:26:09.830 --> 04:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
of other issues and we should be at the
 
04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
Leading Edge of this issue
 
04:26:13.849 --> 04:26:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative saley thank you and thank
 
04:26:18.469 --> 04:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
04:26:18.479 --> 04:26:19.130 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
um

04:26:19.130 --> 04:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:22.490 --> 04:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
I I am aware that um the trans community
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
in particular is subject to more
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
violence than pretty much any other
 
04:26:30.769 --> 04:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
community are you aware of specific
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
cases in New Hampshire where people have
 
04:26:36.050 --> 04:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
been assaulted purely because of their
 
04:26:37.969 --> 04:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation sexual expression
 
04:26:41.389 --> 04:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
gender expression or gender identity
 
04:26:44.090 --> 04:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
I I can't decide a particular case but I
 
04:26:46.130 --> 04:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
do just out of lack of knowledge of a
 
04:26:48.889 --> 04:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
particular case representative however
 
04:26:52.010 --> 04:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
it happens every day uh one in four uh
 
04:26:55.010 --> 04:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
lgbtq people lesbian gay bisexual people
 
04:26:57.110 --> 04:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
will be the victim of an assault in
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
their lifetime
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
um and the similar statistic exists for
 
04:27:02.689 --> 04:27:02.699 align:start position:0%
transgender people and this comes from
 
04:27:06.229 --> 04:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
FBI crime data uh the reality is that
 
04:27:09.769 --> 04:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
the number of lgbtq people who are the
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
victim of an assault vastly outstrips
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
the number of CIS or heterosexual people
 
04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
who be the victim of an assault in their
 
04:27:21.950 --> 04:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
lifetime which is why one in two lgbtq
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
people will suffer major depression
 
04:27:26.929 --> 04:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
their lifetime not because being gay or
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
being transgender makes you depressed
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
but being in a society in which hatred
 
04:27:35.510 --> 04:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
exists make you depressed we need to act
 
04:27:39.170 --> 04:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
as a society to begin to address these
 
04:27:42.649 --> 04:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
hateful actions that occur against lgbtq
 
04:27:45.530 --> 04:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
people and addressing something like the
 
04:27:48.110 --> 04:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
existence of the gay Panic defense is
 
04:27:50.809 --> 04:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
one piece of the puzzle we are better
 
04:27:54.050 --> 04:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
than this as a society
 
04:27:57.410 --> 04:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
ask yourself the question
 
04:28:00.530 --> 04:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
ought sexuality be used at it as a
 
04:28:03.170 --> 04:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
defense against somebody
 
04:28:06.530 --> 04:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
and ask yourself this question
 
04:28:10.010 --> 04:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
ought a woman be able to say that she
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
murdered a man because the man flirted
 
04:28:13.729 --> 04:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
with her
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
and then have her murder charge
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
downgraded because that is the exact
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:25.250 --> 04:28:25.260 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and to the
 
04:28:46.370 --> 04:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
committee for having me here today I'm
 
04:28:48.769 --> 04:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
representative Caitlin kutab I represent

Rocky m17 Windham
 
04:28:53.570 --> 04:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
I come here today in support of house
 
04:28:57.290 --> 04:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
bill 315. I did want to make one
 
04:28:58.929 --> 04:28:58.939 align:start position:0%
correction to something that
 
04:29:01.610 --> 04:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
representative filio said
 
04:29:06.290 --> 04:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
it is my belief that in the 1999 brutal
 
04:29:09.170 --> 04:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
killing of Matthew Shepard that yes
 
04:29:11.450 --> 04:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
Aaron McKinney's attorney did try and
 
04:29:13.309 --> 04:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
use this defense but was unable to
 
04:29:15.170 --> 04:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
because the state of Wyoming does not
 
04:29:15.180 --> 04:29:16.370 align:start position:0%
because the state of Wyoming does not
allow

04:29:16.370 --> 04:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
allow
 
04:29:18.649 --> 04:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
an insanity defense and it was
 
04:29:20.689 --> 04:29:20.699 align:start position:0%
considered to be this the same in an
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
effect so he was actually charged with
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
murder because he wasn't allowed to use
 
04:29:27.110 --> 04:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
that sentence
 
04:29:27.120 --> 04:29:28.729 align:start position:0%
that sentence
but

04:29:28.729 --> 04:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:29:30.649 --> 04:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we do allow the
 
04:29:34.969 --> 04:29:34.979 align:start position:0%
insanity defense under RSA 628 too
 
04:29:39.229 --> 04:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
in 2018 this defense was used in Texas
 
04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
by James Miller for stabbing his
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
neighbor Daniel Spencer to death
 
04:29:46.729 --> 04:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
after finding out he was gay
 
04:29:49.849 --> 04:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
instead of being convicted of murder he
 
04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
was convicted of manslaughter
 
04:29:55.130 --> 04:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
and was only sentenced to six months in
 
04:29:58.550 --> 04:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
jail in 10 years probation
 
04:30:00.590 --> 04:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
as as
 
04:30:03.070 --> 04:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
representative fellow testified
 
04:30:06.410 --> 04:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
there are similar legislation in 16
 
04:30:09.170 --> 04:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
States as well as the District of
 
04:30:09.180 --> 04:30:10.490 align:start position:0%
States as well as the District of
Columbia

04:30:10.490 --> 04:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
Columbia
 
04:30:13.309 --> 04:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
and the reason why it's needed is
 
04:30:16.849 --> 04:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
because in New Hampshire we do allow a
 
04:30:19.790 --> 04:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
an insanity defense and so
 
04:30:21.950 --> 04:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
we need to clarify that it's prohibited
 
04:30:24.469 --> 04:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
that you can't use it in this case so
 
04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
for states that don't allow an insanity
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
defense this isn't needed
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
but in states that do this is something
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
that needs to be clarified roughly five
 
04:30:34.729 --> 04:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
percent of our population in New
 
04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire identifies as being part of
 
04:30:38.870 --> 04:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq community
 
04:30:41.090 --> 04:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
and today you have the power to protect
 
04:30:44.149 --> 04:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
them and I ask you
 
04:30:47.330 --> 04:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill to vote in favor to
 
04:30:49.610 --> 04:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
stop this unjust defense from ever being
 
04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
used in our state here in New Hampshire
 
04:30:56.870 --> 04:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:01.849 --> 04:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:16.250 --> 04:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank all my
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
fellow Representatives
 
04:31:25.010 --> 04:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
my name is Jerry Cannon I represent
 
04:31:28.010 --> 04:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
Stratford District 12 which is
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
Somersworth and Rollinsford
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
I am a transgender woman
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
in 2017 when I ran for school board when
 
04:31:41.090 --> 04:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
I first
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
my first couple of years in Somersworth
 
04:31:45.710 --> 04:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
I won
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
a school board position
 
04:31:50.510 --> 04:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
and the very next day I received an
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
anonymous death threat
 
04:31:53.040 --> 04:31:54.530 align:start position:0%
anonymous death threat
oh

04:31:54.530 --> 04:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:31:57.530 --> 04:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
resulting in me buying a handgun
 
04:31:59.450 --> 04:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
because I had no idea where that came
 
04:31:59.460 --> 04:32:00.229 align:start position:0%
because I had no idea where that came
from

04:32:00.229 --> 04:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:32:07.809 --> 04:32:07.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:11.450 --> 04:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
it reminded me of
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
an event that we go through every year
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
talking about transgender it's a
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
transgender day of remembrance
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
this past year
 
04:32:22.080 --> 04:32:23.990 align:start position:0%
this past year
37

04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
37
 
04:32:28.250 --> 04:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
transgender people were gunned down
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
because someone didn't care that they
 
04:32:37.670 --> 04:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:40.490 --> 04:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'll have to admit about 80 percent of
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
the people were Black Or Hispanic
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
and mostly in cities however doesn't
 
04:32:49.370 --> 04:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
mean it doesn't happen in the suburbs as
 
04:32:49.380 --> 04:32:50.689 align:start position:0%
mean it doesn't happen in the suburbs as
well

04:32:50.689 --> 04:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:57.530 --> 04:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
04:32:59.450 --> 04:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
let people
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
shoot an LGBT person just because they
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
don't like them or don't like their
 
04:33:08.449 --> 04:33:08.459 align:start position:0%
their politics or don't like that
 
04:33:08.459 --> 04:33:09.890 align:start position:0%
their politics or don't like that
they're

04:33:09.890 --> 04:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
um running for a local office or just
 
04:33:18.590 --> 04:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:21.410 --> 04:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I need to say more it it
 
04:33:24.769 --> 04:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
has me still to this day I still worry
 
04:33:24.779 --> 04:33:26.209 align:start position:0%
has me still to this day I still worry
about

04:33:26.209 --> 04:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
what could happen to me
 
04:33:32.689 --> 04:33:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:35.090 --> 04:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
I know at home I have a handgun next to
 
04:33:38.570 --> 04:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
my bed I hope I never have to use it
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
but if if I have to I will
 
04:33:46.131 --> 04:33:46.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:49.789 --> 04:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.769 --> 04:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
04:33:53.209 --> 04:33:53.219 align:start position:0%
I don't know if
 
04:33:55.490 --> 04:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
um thanks for sharing your story I don't
 
04:33:57.529 --> 04:33:57.539 align:start position:0%
know if my question is best suited for
 
04:33:58.730 --> 04:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
you but I know you're really informed
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
about this topic as far as the function
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
of making claiming a defense when you're
 
04:34:07.010 --> 04:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
engaged in the legal system is it
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
possible assuming that
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
at this point someone's committed a
 
04:34:10.561 --> 04:34:11.689 align:start position:0%
at this point someone's committed a
crime

04:34:11.689 --> 04:34:11.699 align:start position:0%
crime
 
04:34:14.150 --> 04:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
theoretically that has earned them a
 
04:34:17.631 --> 04:34:17.641 align:start position:0%
jury trial is it possible that the
 
04:34:20.449 --> 04:34:20.459 align:start position:0%
defense might select for jurors who
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
would be sympathetic to such a defense
 
04:34:27.289 --> 04:34:27.299 align:start position:0%
it anything's possible so I'm not sure
 
04:34:29.209 --> 04:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if that's sort of the
 
04:34:30.890 --> 04:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
risk that's trying to be addressed I
 
04:34:33.289 --> 04:34:33.299 align:start position:0%
think that comes down to uh how they
 
04:34:37.070 --> 04:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
interview jurors that would be questions
 
04:34:41.150 --> 04:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:47.689 --> 04:34:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you for
 
04:34:54.590 --> 04:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.970 --> 04:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone my name is Bill
 
04:35:14.330 --> 04:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
Blum and I'm here to speak in support of
 
04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
HB 350. today I am here to not only talk
 
04:35:19.490 --> 04:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
about this Bill I'm here to talk about
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
basic human rights
 
04:35:23.330 --> 04:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
I believe in the worth and dignity of
 
04:35:26.209 --> 04:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
all people regardless of gender identity
 
04:35:29.631 --> 04:35:29.641 align:start position:0%
or financial position
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
let me say this in a slightly different
 
04:35:34.730 --> 04:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
way right now this very second we are
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
all breathing the same air
 
04:35:40.189 --> 04:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
and we all hopefully at some point today
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
have had some food
 
04:35:44.390 --> 04:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
which in turn gives our bodies the
 
04:35:46.970 --> 04:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
energy to continue to be able to exist
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
some of us identify as
 
04:35:50.279 --> 04:35:51.890 align:start position:0%
some of us identify as
carnivores

04:35:51.890 --> 04:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
carnivores
 
04:35:51.900 --> 04:35:53.510 align:start position:0%
carnivores
vegetarians

04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
vegetarians
 
04:35:55.609 --> 04:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
and vegans
 
04:35:57.890 --> 04:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
choosing to eat meat or not is our own
 
04:36:00.051 --> 04:36:00.061 align:start position:0%
choice to make this Choice has no impact
 
04:36:02.090 --> 04:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
on the larger community of eating to
 
04:36:02.100 --> 04:36:03.410 align:start position:0%
on the larger community of eating to
survive

04:36:03.410 --> 04:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
survive
 
04:36:05.449 --> 04:36:05.459 align:start position:0%
where am I going with us
 
04:36:07.189 --> 04:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's no secret to anyone here
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
that I am part of the lgbtq
 
04:36:12.830 --> 04:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
community living as a non-binary
 
04:36:12.840 --> 04:36:14.990 align:start position:0%
community living as a non-binary
individual

04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:36:17.090 --> 04:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
I unfortunately have lived experience
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
with discrimination and bias
 
04:36:22.910 --> 04:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
I lost my job without cause in September
 
04:36:24.709 --> 04:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
of last year
 
04:36:26.689 --> 04:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
and I also am having a difficult time
 
04:36:29.449 --> 04:36:29.459 align:start position:0%
finding new employment
 
04:36:31.369 --> 04:36:31.379 align:start position:0%
this could be for a number of reasons
 
04:36:33.650 --> 04:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
some of which might not be obvious as of
 
04:36:33.660 --> 04:36:35.449 align:start position:0%
some of which might not be obvious as of
yet

04:36:35.449 --> 04:36:35.459 align:start position:0%
yet
 
04:36:38.689 --> 04:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
living my authentic life has cost me
 
04:36:41.449 --> 04:36:41.459 align:start position:0%
so far a ton and I wouldn't change it
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
for anything
 
04:36:47.269 --> 04:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
as a fellow human being my ass to you is
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
to not expose me to discrimination
 
04:36:52.609 --> 04:36:52.619 align:start position:0%
in the potential Final Moments Of My
 
04:36:52.619 --> 04:36:53.869 align:start position:0%
in the potential Final Moments Of My
Life

04:36:53.869 --> 04:36:53.879 align:start position:0%
Life
 
04:36:56.269 --> 04:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
as the knife enters my body and turns
 
04:36:57.830 --> 04:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
into my heart
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
I wish to ask myself did I live a
 
04:37:02.750 --> 04:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
complete and good life
 
04:37:05.631 --> 04:37:05.641 align:start position:0%
and not did this blank hole know that I
 
04:37:07.490 --> 04:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
was transgendered
 
04:37:13.730 --> 04:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.590 --> 04:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:29.631 --> 04:37:29.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:32.510 --> 04:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I'm so lucky that um

04:37:47.390 --> 04:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Hull and I represent Cheshire
 
04:37:50.650 --> 04:37:50.660 align:start position:0%
15 which includes constituents in Keene
 
04:37:53.529 --> 04:37:53.539 align:start position:0%
Walpole Westmoreland Hinsdale
 
04:37:55.750 --> 04:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
Chesterfield and Surrey New Hampshire
 
04:37:59.929 --> 04:37:59.939 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today in support of HB 315
 
04:38:01.849 --> 04:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
I think the vast majority of New
 
04:38:03.949 --> 04:38:03.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constituents regardless of
 
04:38:07.970 --> 04:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
political party support codifying lgbtq
 
04:38:10.310 --> 04:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
plus rights into law and making New
 
04:38:12.410 --> 04:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a welcoming state
 
04:38:14.631 --> 04:38:14.641 align:start position:0%
every New Hampshire constituent knows
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
and loves someone who is a member of the
 
04:38:18.890 --> 04:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus community
 
04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
in my city of Keene the school board
 
04:38:23.330 --> 04:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
unanimously passed an affirming
 
04:38:26.209 --> 04:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
transgender policy and Keene State has a
 
04:38:28.670 --> 04:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
flourishing Pride Alliance by and large
 
04:38:31.010 --> 04:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
my constituents reject bigotry and
 
04:38:32.689 --> 04:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
support inclusiveness
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
I cannot think of another instance in
 
04:38:37.310 --> 04:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
which a victim's identity can be used as
 
04:38:40.490 --> 04:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
a defense in a crime and so this is a
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
long time coming our neighbors in
 
04:38:44.449 --> 04:38:44.459 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Rhode Island Maine and
 
04:38:46.570 --> 04:38:46.580 align:start position:0%
Vermont have passed similar legislation
 
04:38:49.789 --> 04:38:49.799 align:start position:0%
and we want people in our state to feel
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
safe and we take pride in being a state
 
04:38:54.769 --> 04:38:54.779 align:start position:0%
that really values diversity
 
04:38:56.689 --> 04:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
this bill would be a crucial step
 
04:38:59.689 --> 04:38:59.699 align:start position:0%
forward in establishing legal safety for
 
04:39:02.990 --> 04:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq plus Community I've had many
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
members of that Community reach out to
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
me in support of this bill and I urge
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
you to support it as well thank you so
 
04:39:15.349 --> 04:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:21.890 --> 04:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.289 --> 04:39:33.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
hello members of the committee my name
 
04:39:37.690 --> 04:39:37.700 align:start position:0%
is Linds Jake house and I live in Dover
 
04:39:40.970 --> 04:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
I am the founder of 603 equality which
 
04:39:43.070 --> 04:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
is pursuing non-profit status as a
 
04:39:46.190 --> 04:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide lgbtq organization I am
 
04:39:48.410 --> 04:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
non-binary and you see them pronouns and
 
04:39:50.448 --> 04:39:50.458 align:start position:0%
I strongly support HB
 
04:39:53.030 --> 04:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
3 15.
 
04:39:55.490 --> 04:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned before
 
04:39:57.230 --> 04:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
um Concord High School just put on a
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
powerful showing of The Laramie Project
 
04:40:01.610 --> 04:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
a play that shows as the murder of
 
04:40:04.610 --> 04:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
Matthew Shepard in 1998 Laramie Wyoming
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
some may think of violent killings like
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
that as having happened long enough ago
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
that we're not still feeling the effects
 
04:40:13.610 --> 04:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
of them today but just this past year at
 
04:40:15.890 --> 04:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
least 32 people were murdered for being
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
transgender and lgbtq plus people in our
 
04:40:21.288 --> 04:40:21.298 align:start position:0%
state have seen increased violent
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
threats in November a small number of
 
04:40:26.330 --> 04:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
white nationalists including the proud
 
04:40:28.550 --> 04:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
boys and their sympathizers showed up
 
04:40:30.530 --> 04:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
outside the t total or on Main Street in
 
04:40:32.930 --> 04:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
Concord to protest a drag queen Story
 
04:40:35.630 --> 04:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
Hour and over 100 people showed up to
 
04:40:38.470 --> 04:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
show support for the lgbtq community
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
just after that 603 equality held a
 
04:40:43.430 --> 04:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
vigil for the lives lost to the Colorado
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
Club Q shooting attended by 125 people
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
who shared their deep sadness and fear
 
04:40:53.030 --> 04:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
and mostly just wanted to feel safe
 
04:40:56.750 --> 04:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
although the lgbtq Panic defense is used
 
04:40:59.708 --> 04:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
in the specific instance of manslaughter
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
a large part of the lgbtq community has
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
felt the fear of violent death
 
04:41:06.890 --> 04:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
I felt it when I read about the Orlando
 
04:41:09.410 --> 04:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
pulse shooting having just coming come
 
04:41:11.170 --> 04:41:11.180 align:start position:0%
back from a pride Night Out in Boston
 
04:41:14.330 --> 04:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
that fear is Multiplied for lgbtq people
 
04:41:16.730 --> 04:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
who have disabilities and who are black
 
04:41:19.128 --> 04:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
indigenous or people of color
 
04:41:21.770 --> 04:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq Panic defense blames people
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
for their own death which is
 
04:41:25.850 --> 04:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
dehumanizing so we must act to
 
04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
delegitimize this anti-lgbtq defense and
 
04:41:31.368 --> 04:41:31.378 align:start position:0%
send a message that lgbtq wives are
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
valuable I'll email a copy of my
 
04:41:38.690 --> 04:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:40.730 --> 04:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
please accept my apology for the
 
04:41:42.770 --> 04:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
watching of your last name thank you no
 
04:41:47.690 --> 04:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:00.110 --> 04:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and good afternoon members of
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Hayden Smith
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm from Hanover New Hampshire and
 
04:42:04.730 --> 04:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing the New Hampshire
 
04:42:07.128 --> 04:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
youth movement to testify in support of
 
04:42:08.810 --> 04:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
HB 315
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
our organization's membership includes
 
04:42:13.250 --> 04:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
many lgbtq plus young people from across
 
04:42:14.750 --> 04:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
the state and it is critical that we
 
04:42:16.550 --> 04:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
pass this bill to ensure that they are
 
04:42:19.550 --> 04:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
afforded Equal justice under state law
 
04:42:21.410 --> 04:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
our laws are supposed to protect the
 
04:42:23.448 --> 04:42:23.458 align:start position:0%
ability of all Granite Staters to live
 
04:42:25.970 --> 04:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
and express themselves freely yet state
 
04:42:27.948 --> 04:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
law does not guarantee equal legal
 
04:42:30.530 --> 04:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
protections for lgbtq plus people thanks
 
04:42:32.570 --> 04:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
in part to the continued allowance under
 
04:42:35.030 --> 04:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
common law of a legal strategy known as
 
04:42:37.730 --> 04:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
the gay Panic defense or the lgbtq plus
 
04:42:40.128 --> 04:42:40.138 align:start position:0%
Panic defense in New Hampshire
 
04:42:42.050 --> 04:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
the gay Panic defense is built on the
 
04:42:44.208 --> 04:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
notion that lgbtq plus people are
 
04:42:46.250 --> 04:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
inherently dangerous and the fact that
 
04:42:48.530 --> 04:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
this strategy is still permitted sends
 
04:42:50.150 --> 04:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
the message that the state believes is
 
04:42:52.970 --> 04:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
it is acceptable to harm or kill someone
 
04:42:57.470 --> 04:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
solely for being perceived as lgbtq Plus
 
04:43:00.530 --> 04:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
in effect this strategy demonizes lgbtq
 
04:43:02.330 --> 04:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
plus individuals who Express themselves
 
04:43:05.930 --> 04:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
openly and exposes them to Mortal Danger
 
04:43:07.610 --> 04:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
suffer with my dear friends and
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues belong to our state's lgbtq
 
04:43:11.030 --> 04:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
plus community
 
04:43:13.850 --> 04:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
and it is unconscionable to me that the
 
04:43:15.650 --> 04:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
state treats them as if their lives are
 
04:43:18.410 --> 04:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
of a lesser value than others
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
our state owes lgbtq plus people equal
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
protection under the law but we still do
 
04:43:24.230 --> 04:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
not have that as long as the gay
 
04:43:25.970 --> 04:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
panicked offense in similar practices
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
are permitted
 
04:43:30.410 --> 04:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
hb315 would Rectify this issue by
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
Banning the defense through its
 
04:43:33.948 --> 04:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
prohibition on provocations based on an
 
04:43:36.110 --> 04:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
individual's gender identity gender
 
04:43:39.288 --> 04:43:39.298 align:start position:0%
expression or sexual orientation
 
04:43:41.090 --> 04:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
for the sake of defending the lives of
 
04:43:43.490 --> 04:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus people in our state and
 
04:43:45.288 --> 04:43:45.298 align:start position:0%
upholding Justice For Those harmed or
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
killed I urge the committee to vote
 
04:43:50.270 --> 04:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on HP 315 thank you for
 
04:43:51.948 --> 04:43:51.958 align:start position:0%

04:43:53.868 --> 04:43:53.878 align:start position:0%

lgbtqia people uh you know we do not
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%

04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
concerning a lot of
 
04:45:12.110 --> 04:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
homophobic and things like that I'm
 
04:45:13.610 --> 04:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
wondering since you have been out of
 
04:45:15.288 --> 04:45:15.298 align:start position:0%
high school for a little while would you
 
04:45:18.530 --> 04:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
see that as a change or an increase or
 
04:45:21.288 --> 04:45:21.298 align:start position:0%
would you was that your experience when
 
04:45:24.110 --> 04:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
you were in New Hampshire schools
 
04:45:28.670 --> 04:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
um when I was in uh school at least the
 
04:45:28.680 --> 04:45:29.750 align:start position:0%
um when I was in uh school at least the
uh

04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:32.570 --> 04:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
could I ask you to clarify the question
 
04:45:35.930 --> 04:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
I guess it would seem to me that there's
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
been an uptick and an increase in those
 
04:45:39.890 --> 04:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
type of
 
04:45:42.530 --> 04:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
um uh and and seeing seeing that
 
04:45:44.510 --> 04:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
manifested in the high school and I'm
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
not sure because my son this is his
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
first year in high school I'm wondering
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
if this is a change if it's actually an
 
04:45:52.850 --> 04:45:52.860 align:start position:0%
increase or if it's been steady
 
04:45:55.190 --> 04:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
does that make sense I'm sorry I'm not
 
04:45:58.190 --> 04:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
um could I ask an increase in what in uh
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
homophobic attacks uh okay thank you for
 
04:46:02.448 --> 04:46:02.458 align:start position:0%
answering thank you for clarifying oh
 
04:46:05.090 --> 04:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
that makes sense um
 
04:46:08.208 --> 04:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
um well I will say I do
 
04:46:10.610 --> 04:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
um I think it is I have seen more
 
04:46:12.590 --> 04:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
reports at least
 
04:46:14.510 --> 04:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
um I do keep up with some news in my
 
04:46:17.690 --> 04:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
school district after I graduated of
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
um homophobic incidents
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
um I think some of it may be attributed
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
to the fact that we are it is finally
 
04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
becoming we're finally becoming more
 
04:46:28.368 --> 04:46:28.378 align:start position:0%
aware that such things are homophobic
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
and people are more
 
04:46:33.288 --> 04:46:33.298 align:start position:0%
um able to report them without facing uh
 
04:46:36.530 --> 04:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
as much attribution as they used to uh
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
but yes I do I have noticed an uptick in
 
04:46:41.448 --> 04:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
reports of behavior and I'm in the Upper
 
04:46:43.550 --> 04:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
Valley School Districts at least thank
 
04:46:43.560 --> 04:46:46.970 align:start position:0%
Valley School Districts at least thank
you

04:46:46.970 --> 04:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:55.368 --> 04:46:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:58.110 --> 04:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
is there somebody named James here
 
04:46:58.120 --> 04:47:01.490 align:start position:0%
is there somebody named James here
[Laughter]

04:47:01.490 --> 04:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:47:08.270 --> 04:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
hello and thank you
 
04:47:13.128 --> 04:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
my name is James baumersbach I am the
 
04:47:14.810 --> 04:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
legislative chair for New Hampshire's
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association I'm also a
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
practicing forensic psychologist here in
 
04:47:20.330 --> 04:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to testify in support of
 
04:47:25.610 --> 04:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 315 I thank the committee for their
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
time I'll be happy to answer any
 
04:47:29.208 --> 04:47:29.218 align:start position:0%
questions uh to my best of my ability at
 
04:47:30.770 --> 04:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
the end of my testimony
 
04:47:32.208 --> 04:47:32.218 align:start position:0%
I would simply like to point out a
 
04:47:35.030 --> 04:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
couple of points to the committee at
 
04:47:36.110 --> 04:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
this time
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
first of all as a practicing forensic
 
04:47:42.170 --> 04:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
psychologist the question before uh or
 
04:47:43.850 --> 04:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
relevant in this case is whether or not
 
04:47:46.670 --> 04:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
first of all that this defense is
 
04:47:49.490 --> 04:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
used and the answer is yes
 
04:47:52.368 --> 04:47:52.378 align:start position:0%
um I believe uh information I've read is
 
04:47:55.208 --> 04:47:55.218 align:start position:0%
that there's been about 200 to 250 cases
 
04:47:57.890 --> 04:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
uh that have proceeded nationally using
 
04:48:00.110 --> 04:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
this as a legal defense so obviously
 
04:48:04.430 --> 04:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
this is a rare but it is used second of
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
all in about 13 of those cases the
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
efforts were successful to get this
 
04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
defense through to a jury so while again
 
04:48:16.128 --> 04:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
not the majority of cases we do see that
 
04:48:18.530 --> 04:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
this is a defense that is used and is
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
successful at times
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
I always tell you as a psychologist that
 
04:48:26.288 --> 04:48:26.298 align:start position:0%
I am not aware of any research that
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
identifies gay Panic or lgbtq Panic as a
 
04:48:33.410 --> 04:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
legitimate psychological phenomenon this
 
04:48:36.110 --> 04:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
is purely a legal phenomenon a legal
 
04:48:38.150 --> 04:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
work of art
 
04:48:39.890 --> 04:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
um by defense attorneys in order to
 
04:48:41.690 --> 04:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
establish that there is some sort of
 
04:48:46.850 --> 04:48:46.860 align:start position:0%
diminished capacity or some sort of uh
 
04:48:46.860 --> 04:48:48.410 align:start position:0%
diminished capacity or some sort of uh
uh

04:48:48.410 --> 04:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:51.650 --> 04:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
mental crisis which causes a person to
 
04:48:53.930 --> 04:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
lose control of their actions at the
 
04:48:56.208 --> 04:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
moment that they commit this crime in
 
04:48:58.250 --> 04:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
short there's no evidence for that as a
 
04:48:58.260 --> 04:48:59.208 align:start position:0%
short there's no evidence for that as a
reality

04:48:59.208 --> 04:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
reality
 
04:49:01.128 --> 04:49:01.138 align:start position:0%
so what we have here is a defense that
 
04:49:03.890 --> 04:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
is sometimes effective and that does
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes get used that is based on
 
04:49:08.030 --> 04:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
illegal fiction
 
04:49:10.730 --> 04:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
and so in that regard I am in support of
 
04:49:12.830 --> 04:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
banning this as a legal defense here in
 
04:49:15.470 --> 04:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I will note with
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
an agreement with what else was said
 
04:49:18.650 --> 04:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
that this is to my knowledge this has
 
04:49:20.628 --> 04:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
not been used in New Hampshire but it
 
04:49:21.530 --> 04:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
does not mean that it will not
 
04:49:24.410 --> 04:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
potentially be used in the future
 
04:49:27.650 --> 04:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
I would also like to point out that the
 
04:49:29.810 --> 04:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
American Psychological Association as
 
04:49:33.708 --> 04:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
recently as 2021 has noted that use of
 
04:49:36.470 --> 04:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
gay panic and also just the allowance of
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
gay Panic as a legal defense
 
04:49:43.128 --> 04:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
um is considered to be a form of
 
04:49:46.250 --> 04:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
bias against the LGBT community on an
 
04:49:48.650 --> 04:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
Institutional basis in other words what
 
04:49:51.170 --> 04:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here is an attempt to
 
04:49:51.180 --> 04:49:51.830 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here is an attempt to
um

04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:53.990 --> 04:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
recognize the rights of these people to
 
04:49:56.930 --> 04:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
exist uh and to have score that they
 
04:49:58.970 --> 04:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
will receive Justice in the same way
 
04:50:01.970 --> 04:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
that anyone else would expect to have
 
04:50:04.090 --> 04:50:04.100 align:start position:0%
so I will happy to answer any questions
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:12.650 --> 04:50:12.660 align:start position:0%

testimony but one of our members Jordan
King

04:50:51.050 --> 04:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
King
 
04:50:54.170 --> 04:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
um who's 19 years old

um so my name is Jordan King I'm a
 
04:50:59.330 --> 04:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
resident of Milford New Hampshire I'm
 
04:51:01.970 --> 04:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
urging this committee to pass HB 315
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
which would ban the gay Panic defense
 
04:51:05.628 --> 04:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
from further justifying the murder of
 
04:51:08.090 --> 04:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus people
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
as a bisexual woman and part of the
 
04:51:12.650 --> 04:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus Community this bill would
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
protect me and people like me from the
 
04:51:16.610 --> 04:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
fear that someone could get away with
 
04:51:19.310 --> 04:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
the unthinkable because I am queer
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
to illustrate why I think this bill is
 
04:51:22.970 --> 04:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
important I want to share a brief story
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
a few months ago I went on a first date
 
04:51:28.368 --> 04:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
with a guy I only had met briefly and
 
04:51:30.410 --> 04:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
continued talking to online he was very
 
04:51:32.690 --> 04:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
nice online but I didn't know much about
 
04:51:35.810 --> 04:51:35.820 align:start position:0%
him our plan was to go on a little day
 
04:51:37.788 --> 04:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
trip and I was excited our plan seemed
 
04:51:40.610 --> 04:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
fun and first dates are exciting before
 
04:51:42.410 --> 04:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
going I was talking to friends about
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
going and promised to keep my location
 
04:51:47.330 --> 04:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
shared with them for safety thinking
 
04:51:48.830 --> 04:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
about how to stay safe and meeting up
 
04:51:50.330 --> 04:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
with someone I had largely only
 
04:51:52.250 --> 04:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
interacted with online I had a lot of
 
04:51:52.260 --> 04:51:54.110 align:start position:0%
interacted with online I had a lot of
concern

04:51:54.110 --> 04:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:51:56.930 --> 04:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
I had a concern a lot of young people in
 
04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
this era of social media and dating apps
 
04:52:01.730 --> 04:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
I brought another concern up to them
 
04:52:03.530 --> 04:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
maybe I should tell him I'm queer before
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
going in case something comes up so I
 
04:52:09.230 --> 04:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
don't get I pause for a second and tried
 
04:52:09.240 --> 04:52:10.070 align:start position:0%
don't get I pause for a second and tried
to

04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:52:11.930 --> 04:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
keep the conversation lighthearted with
 
04:52:14.390 --> 04:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
the invention of a new verb gay panic
 
04:52:14.400 --> 04:52:15.650 align:start position:0%
the invention of a new verb gay panic
defensed

04:52:15.650 --> 04:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
defensed
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
of course rationally I did not expect my
 
04:52:21.288 --> 04:52:21.298 align:start position:0%
date to kill me if my being bisexual
 
04:52:22.868 --> 04:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
came up at some point during the day
 
04:52:25.250 --> 04:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
however the fact that I thought of that
 
04:52:27.410 --> 04:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
and did end up telling him beforehand
 
04:52:29.690 --> 04:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
just to be safe shows the harm of
 
04:52:31.730 --> 04:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
allowing someone's sexuality to justify
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
hateful murder
 
04:52:35.448 --> 04:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
growing up knowing the gay Panic defense
 
04:52:37.970 --> 04:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
existed and was the law in New Hampshire
 
04:52:40.430 --> 04:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
while I was discovering my sexuality and
 
04:52:42.830 --> 04:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
coming out meant that since my early
 
04:52:44.570 --> 04:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
teenage years I lived at the
 
04:52:45.770 --> 04:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
understanding that the law and the
 
04:52:47.930 --> 04:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
government would look the other way if
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
one day I joined the list of people
 
04:52:52.250 --> 04:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
whose lives had been cut short by hatred
 
04:52:55.128 --> 04:52:55.138 align:start position:0%
that apathy on the part of the state was
 
04:52:56.628 --> 04:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
an additional weight to the realization
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
that people out there would hate me for
 
04:53:00.470 --> 04:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
who I was so much they would want to
 
04:53:01.550 --> 04:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
kill me
 
04:53:04.730 --> 04:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
growing up as an lgbtq plus person meant
 
04:53:06.530 --> 04:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
hearing about hate crimes and thinking
 
04:53:08.330 --> 04:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
that could never happen to me before
 
04:53:09.890 --> 04:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
realizing in the back of your mind you
 
04:53:10.970 --> 04:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
knew it could
 
04:53:13.128 --> 04:53:13.138 align:start position:0%
people like me
 
04:53:15.170 --> 04:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
in states with the gay Panic defense
 
04:53:16.910 --> 04:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
have an additional fear when coming out
 
04:53:19.610 --> 04:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
because the battle response could
 
04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
be more than someone not accepting you
 
04:53:23.690 --> 04:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
but could mean someone killing you
 
04:53:26.270 --> 04:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
without Consequence the existence of the
 
04:53:28.490 --> 04:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
gay Panic defense tells lgbtq plus
 
04:53:30.650 --> 04:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
people that not only do our lives not
 
04:53:33.288 --> 04:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
matter but the hatred we face is
 
04:53:37.128 --> 04:53:37.138 align:start position:0%
justifiable and our fault lgbtq plus
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire have lived with
 
04:53:40.550 --> 04:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
this weight and apathy of the government
 
04:53:43.128 --> 04:53:43.138 align:start position:0%
for long enough it's past
 
04:53:45.288 --> 04:53:45.298 align:start position:0%
it's past time in this committee and the
 
04:53:48.170 --> 04:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
general court recognize lgbtq plus labs
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire matter and protect them
 
04:53:53.690 --> 04:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
from bypassing HB 315 and banning the
 
04:54:00.170 --> 04:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:01.550 --> 04:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
um no questions thank you very much for
 
04:54:04.250 --> 04:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:05.930 --> 04:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
is there any more wishing to testify in

I will now open the public hearing for
 
05:02:34.550 --> 05:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 590 representative Newman
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
I will now open up the public hearing
 
05:02:38.930 --> 05:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 596fn prohibiting the use
 
05:02:40.550 --> 05:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
of racial profiling and law enforcement
 
05:02:42.830 --> 05:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
activities and in sentencing
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:48.470 --> 05:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee
 
05:02:48.480 --> 05:02:49.128 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee
um

05:02:49.128 --> 05:02:49.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
HP 596 is a bill that attempts to draw a
 
05:02:55.430 --> 05:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
couple of very specific lines in the
 
05:02:58.368 --> 05:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
sand first of all it would prohibit the
 
05:03:00.230 --> 05:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
use of racial profiling by law
 
05:03:02.390 --> 05:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement Personnel in New Hampshire
 
05:03:04.910 --> 05:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
and it would also prohibit race or
 
05:03:07.490 --> 05:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
ethnicity from being a factor considered
 
05:03:09.470 --> 05:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
in determining a defendant's sentence in
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
a criminal case
 
05:03:12.240 --> 05:03:12.948 align:start position:0%
a criminal case
um

05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:16.128 --> 05:03:16.138 align:start position:0%
in 2021 as you know the legislature
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
passed a series of of comprehensive
 
05:03:21.110 --> 05:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
police reforms after uh the death of
 
05:03:23.208 --> 05:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
George Floyd
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
um those reforms were passed in a bill
 
05:03:31.610 --> 05:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh SB 96 and much of the content of H of
 
05:03:34.490 --> 05:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
SB 96 was a result of the work of the
 
05:03:36.288 --> 05:03:36.298 align:start position:0%
liac commission
 
05:03:36.298 --> 05:03:37.270 align:start position:0%
liac commission
um

05:03:37.270 --> 05:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there were things that
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
were that the there were recommendations
 
05:03:45.830 --> 05:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
that the liac commission made that did
 
05:03:48.050 --> 05:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
not make it into the final version of SB
 
05:03:48.060 --> 05:03:49.510 align:start position:0%
not make it into the final version of SB
96

05:03:49.510 --> 05:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
96
 
05:03:49.520 --> 05:03:51.190 align:start position:0%
96
including

05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
including
 
05:03:55.310 --> 05:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
a provision that would have required the
 
05:04:00.530 --> 05:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
state to collect uh data on uh on stops
 
05:04:02.830 --> 05:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
uh made
 
05:04:07.010 --> 05:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
made in the state and collect racial and
 
05:04:09.170 --> 05:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
ethnic data on that and the purpose of
 
05:04:12.708 --> 05:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
that was really to uh to to try to
 
05:04:15.708 --> 05:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
either either to to basically gather
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
data to try to determine whether New
 
05:04:23.330 --> 05:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had a racial profiling problem
 
05:04:27.410 --> 05:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
um since uh that part of the build uh
 
05:04:31.368 --> 05:04:31.378 align:start position:0%
didn't make it through uh in 2021
 
05:04:32.750 --> 05:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we have
 
05:04:35.448 --> 05:04:35.458 align:start position:0%
learned is that racial profiling does
 
05:04:37.310 --> 05:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
exist in New Hampshire it continues to
 
05:04:40.368 --> 05:04:40.378 align:start position:0%
exist the granite state news
 
05:04:43.190 --> 05:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
collaborative did a very comprehensive
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
two-part series uh uh two years after
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
the liac commission disbanded on racial
 
05:04:52.910 --> 05:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
profiling in New Hampshire
 
05:04:57.230 --> 05:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
um so the the issue isn't uh so much
 
05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're collecting enough
 
05:05:02.690 --> 05:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
data to prove it the issue is that we we
 
05:05:04.970 --> 05:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
do have a problem and and as a country
 
05:05:08.330 --> 05:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
we have a problem with racial profiling
 
05:05:10.670 --> 05:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh the incident with Tyree Nichols
 
05:05:13.730 --> 05:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
that's been in the news lately was the
 
05:05:17.930 --> 05:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
result of a uh that of us of a stop that
 
05:05:20.208 --> 05:05:20.218 align:start position:0%
initially started uh for reckless
 
05:05:20.218 --> 05:05:21.948 align:start position:0%
initially started uh for reckless
driving

05:05:21.948 --> 05:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
driving
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things uh as I read
 
05:05:27.350 --> 05:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
the news reports has been disproven
 
05:05:30.410 --> 05:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
um was the fact was that he actually
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
wasn't driving recklessly when he was
 
05:05:32.638 --> 05:05:34.550 align:start position:0%
wasn't driving recklessly when he was
stopped

05:05:34.550 --> 05:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
stopped
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
um and unfortunately what what has what
 
05:05:40.730 --> 05:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
happened to Tyree Nichols is not an
 
05:05:44.448 --> 05:05:44.458 align:start position:0%
uncommon occurrence in this country in
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
2021 the New York Times did an
 
05:05:47.040 --> 05:05:48.970 align:start position:0%
2021 the New York Times did an
investigation

05:05:48.970 --> 05:05:48.980 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
05:05:52.368 --> 05:05:52.378 align:start position:0%
and basically one of the things that uh
 
05:05:54.350 --> 05:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
that they discovered was that over a
 
05:05:57.850 --> 05:05:57.860 align:start position:0%
five-year period uh 600 people
 
05:06:01.010 --> 05:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
were killed in the United States after
 
05:06:03.708 --> 05:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
traffic stops uh not we're not talking
 
05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
about arrests here for Commission of
 
05:06:08.208 --> 05:06:08.218 align:start position:0%
crimes we're talking about people who
 
05:06:11.208 --> 05:06:11.218 align:start position:0%
were killed after uh being stopped by a
 
05:06:12.890 --> 05:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer during a traffic
 
05:06:12.900 --> 05:06:13.850 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer during a traffic
stop

05:06:13.850 --> 05:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
stop
 
05:06:17.090 --> 05:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh and 400 of the passengers who were
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
killed had no weapon uh and were not
 
05:06:22.550 --> 05:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
being pursued by a violent uh for a
 
05:06:24.410 --> 05:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
violent crime
 
05:06:26.510 --> 05:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
there are there are over 30 States
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
currently uh that prohibit uh racial
 
05:06:32.330 --> 05:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
profiling in one form or another by
 
05:06:35.390 --> 05:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
Statute and unfortunately New Hampshire
 
05:06:37.128 --> 05:06:37.138 align:start position:0%
isn't one of them
 
05:06:41.090 --> 05:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons why I wanted to
 
05:06:42.890 --> 05:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
submit this bill in the first place is
 
05:06:44.930 --> 05:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
is I do think it's important for us to
 
05:06:47.690 --> 05:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
make a statement of policy that under no
 
05:06:50.690 --> 05:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
circumstances is it acceptable for a law
 
05:06:52.550 --> 05:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in the state of New
 
05:06:52.560 --> 05:06:53.570 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in the state of New
Hampshire

05:06:53.570 --> 05:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:06:57.830 --> 05:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
to racially profile another person
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh this is aberrant Behavior the the uh
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
the Bush Administration essentially uh
 
05:07:08.510 --> 05:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited it from being done at the
 
05:07:12.368 --> 05:07:12.378 align:start position:0%
federal level uh back in 2003
 
05:07:14.690 --> 05:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
and I think sometimes it just takes a
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
while for us to catch up and one of the
 
05:07:19.850 --> 05:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
things that I I also wanted to
 
05:07:23.510 --> 05:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
to leave you with uh is that Governor
 
05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
sununu when he actually signed SB 96
 
05:07:29.750 --> 05:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
into law in 2021 so the liac commission
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
isn't a one and done the most important
 
05:07:35.090 --> 05:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
part of what this group has done is
 
05:07:36.770 --> 05:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
creating something which is living and
 
05:07:38.810 --> 05:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
breathing and will forever live within
 
05:07:41.270 --> 05:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
the state to keep ourself ahead of the
 
05:07:41.280 --> 05:07:42.288 align:start position:0%
the state to keep ourself ahead of the
game

05:07:42.288 --> 05:07:42.298 align:start position:0%
game
 
05:07:44.750 --> 05:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that the governor
 
05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
alluded to was that Delia commission
 
05:07:51.350 --> 05:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
really was the starting point for
 
05:07:53.510 --> 05:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
addressing issues when it comes to
 
05:07:55.250 --> 05:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
police misconduct when it comes to
 
05:07:57.890 --> 05:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
things like racial profiling it wasn't
 
05:08:00.890 --> 05:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
the finish line and I I don't I wouldn't
 
05:08:04.070 --> 05:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't uh propose that that this
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
bill represents the Finish Line either I
 
05:08:07.730 --> 05:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
think that there's a lot of work in
 
05:08:09.730 --> 05:08:09.740 align:start position:0%
addition to this bill
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
that will will help heal some of the
 
05:08:15.910 --> 05:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
wounds and and and perhaps help people
 
05:08:18.530 --> 05:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
in our minority communities in New
 
05:08:21.470 --> 05:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire feel feel safer in their
 
05:08:23.530 --> 05:08:23.540 align:start position:0%
interactions with police but
 
05:08:26.090 --> 05:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
unfortunately too many people at this
 
05:08:29.570 --> 05:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
point uh turn on the news and they don't
 
05:08:31.368 --> 05:08:31.378 align:start position:0%
feel safe
 
05:08:33.650 --> 05:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
they feel that there is one standard
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
that is applied when police officers are
 
05:08:40.670 --> 05:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
stopping people who look like me
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
and another standard that's applied when
 
05:08:46.010 --> 05:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
it comes to people who look like them
 
05:08:49.550 --> 05:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
and frankly that's not the way our
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
justice system uh should should work and
 
05:08:56.390 --> 05:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
I recognize that police officers have a
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
very difficult job you don't sit on this
 
05:09:00.590 --> 05:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
committee for over four years without
 
05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
recognizing how difficult that job can
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
be how often they're called on to to
 
05:09:09.610 --> 05:09:09.620 align:start position:0%
rely on their judgment
 
05:09:12.830 --> 05:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the policies we make don't
 
05:09:16.788 --> 05:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily make it easier for them to
 
05:09:21.110 --> 05:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
do to do the things they want to do
 
05:09:22.730 --> 05:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
but I think one of the things that we
 
05:09:25.610 --> 05:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
have to realize is that you know in this
 
05:09:25.620 --> 05:09:27.230 align:start position:0%
have to realize is that you know in this
country

05:09:27.230 --> 05:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:09:27.240 --> 05:09:28.010 align:start position:0%
country
um

05:09:28.010 --> 05:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:30.288 --> 05:09:30.298 align:start position:0%
just Justice needs to be something
 
05:09:33.830 --> 05:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's provided uh to everyone uh at an
 
05:09:37.070 --> 05:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
equal level on a Level Playing Field and
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
and when you actually start on the
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
playing field 10 yards behind everybody
 
05:09:40.798 --> 05:09:42.190 align:start position:0%
playing field 10 yards behind everybody
else

05:09:42.190 --> 05:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
else
 
05:09:44.690 --> 05:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
when it comes to things like suspicion
 
05:09:49.128 --> 05:09:49.138 align:start position:0%
of crimes uh that that's a real that's a
 
05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
real issue
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
now the what the bill doesn't do the
 
05:09:56.510 --> 05:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't uh prescribe uh any type of
 
05:10:00.288 --> 05:10:00.298 align:start position:0%
penalty we're not out to uh to penalize
 
05:10:02.270 --> 05:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
officers what we are trying to do though
 
05:10:04.550 --> 05:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
is we are trying to make a policy
 
05:10:07.128 --> 05:10:07.138 align:start position:0%
statement that will go into our statute
 
05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
that will Define profiling and what
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
profiling is
 
05:10:14.868 --> 05:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
um so that uh so that hopefully uh
 
05:10:18.170 --> 05:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
training can be crafted around that and
 
05:10:20.410 --> 05:10:20.420 align:start position:0%
the police standards and training folks
 
05:10:24.110 --> 05:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
can can basically point to the fact now
 
05:10:26.090 --> 05:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
that there that this is part of our
 
05:10:28.128 --> 05:10:28.138 align:start position:0%
statute and that racial profiling is
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited in New Hampshire
 
05:10:32.448 --> 05:10:32.458 align:start position:0%
I also think that just given the events
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
in in the news
 
05:10:37.310 --> 05:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
um this is a a very strong statement
 
05:10:39.050 --> 05:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
this bill would be a very strong
 
05:10:42.770 --> 05:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
statement uh to send to the rest of the
 
05:10:45.170 --> 05:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
country uh at a time when our
 
05:10:48.650 --> 05:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
presidential primaries in jeopardy
 
05:10:51.110 --> 05:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and I think it would be also a very
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
strong statement to send in light of the
 
05:10:56.990 --> 05:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the events of of that have happened
 
05:10:57.000 --> 05:10:58.070 align:start position:0%
of the events of of that have happened
with

05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:11:00.070 --> 05:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
with Tyree Nichols
 
05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
and if you haven't watched that tape I I
 
05:11:07.670 --> 05:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
have two thoughts on that there one is
 
05:11:10.010 --> 05:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
don't watch it unless you're prepared to
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
see something terrible
 
05:11:14.270 --> 05:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
the other is if you're a member of this
 
05:11:14.280 --> 05:11:16.910 align:start position:0%
the other is if you're a member of this
committee

05:11:16.910 --> 05:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
you almost have to watch it because you
 
05:11:21.830 --> 05:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
really don't understand
 
05:11:24.350 --> 05:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
the depth of the consequences you know
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
when when when when this goes wrong when
 
05:11:30.770 --> 05:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
when profiling other people goes wrong
 
05:11:33.470 --> 05:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
it just it it doesn't result in just
 
05:11:36.910 --> 05:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
minor violations and inconveniences
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
people can literally lose their lives
 
05:11:43.368 --> 05:11:43.378 align:start position:0%
because they they may not know how to
 
05:11:47.470 --> 05:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
handle that type of a stop properly
 
05:11:50.208 --> 05:11:50.218 align:start position:0%
they may not handle it the way you and I
 
05:11:52.250 --> 05:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
would handle it and one of the reasons
 
05:11:54.590 --> 05:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
they may not handle it the way you and I
 
05:11:56.448 --> 05:11:56.458 align:start position:0%
would handle it is they have an entirely
 
05:11:58.730 --> 05:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
set of thing different things that they
 
05:11:59.890 --> 05:11:59.900 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
afraid of in those interactions that the
 
05:12:05.390 --> 05:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
long experience has taught them that
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
they need to be extremely concerned
 
05:12:08.160 --> 05:12:09.830 align:start position:0%
they need to be extremely concerned
about

05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
so that that is part of the bill the the
 
05:12:15.288 --> 05:12:15.298 align:start position:0%
second part of the bill uh would also
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
would also address uh data collection
 
05:12:17.760 --> 05:12:19.610 align:start position:0%
would also address uh data collection
around

05:12:19.610 --> 05:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:12:19.620 --> 05:12:20.270 align:start position:0%
around
um

05:12:20.270 --> 05:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:22.868 --> 05:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
uh racial
 
05:12:25.490 --> 05:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
essentially around race and ethnicity is
 
05:12:27.708 --> 05:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
used being potentially used as factors
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
in sentencing one of the things that we
 
05:12:34.448 --> 05:12:34.458 align:start position:0%
found uh in our analysis of
 
05:12:37.070 --> 05:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections data over the
 
05:12:40.430 --> 05:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
years as there are some crimes where
 
05:12:43.270 --> 05:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
there are where people have been
 
05:12:45.890 --> 05:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
disproportionately uh seemingly
 
05:12:49.250 --> 05:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
disproportionately sentenced based on
 
05:12:53.030 --> 05:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
racial factors again the the purpose of
 
05:12:56.150 --> 05:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
that part of the bill uh really is data
 
05:12:58.610 --> 05:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
collection to verify the extent of the
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
problem and given uh the level of
 
05:13:04.010 --> 05:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
cooperation that we've received from the
 
05:13:06.050 --> 05:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections when it comes
 
05:13:08.448 --> 05:13:08.458 align:start position:0%
to providing data for us on things like
 
05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
sentencing bills
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
um I'm uh cautiously optimistic that uh
 
05:13:18.530 --> 05:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Corrections can
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
provide the information that were being
 
05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
asked now that they're being asked to
 
05:13:25.250 --> 05:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
provide in the bill
 
05:13:28.030 --> 05:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
and that that information can be used to
 
05:13:32.990 --> 05:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh to either correct uh a situation then
 
05:13:35.810 --> 05:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
that may need to be corrected or to show
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
that no and new in New Hampshire
 
05:13:40.970 --> 05:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
um we don't have that problem or we
 
05:13:42.890 --> 05:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
don't have that issue but but again
 
05:13:44.810 --> 05:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
there are so many things in this
 
05:13:46.730 --> 05:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
committee that come down to having the
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
right data and so often we don't have
 
05:13:52.128 --> 05:13:52.138 align:start position:0%
the data to prove it
 
05:13:54.170 --> 05:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
and just circling back to where we
 
05:13:54.180 --> 05:13:55.128 align:start position:0%
and just circling back to where we
started

05:13:55.128 --> 05:13:55.138 align:start position:0%
started
 
05:13:55.138 --> 05:13:55.730 align:start position:0%
started
um

05:13:55.730 --> 05:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:59.230 --> 05:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
with racial profiling uh we tried to
 
05:14:01.730 --> 05:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
come at it come at this from trying to
 
05:14:03.708 --> 05:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
get the data first and I think one of
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
the things that we found is that between
 
05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
getting driver's license changed and
 
05:14:11.930 --> 05:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
between uh having Provisions taken out
 
05:14:14.208 --> 05:14:14.218 align:start position:0%
of laws to create study committees that
 
05:14:15.708 --> 05:14:15.718 align:start position:0%
then recommend the creation of other
 
05:14:18.170 --> 05:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
study committees that never get made you
 
05:14:20.750 --> 05:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
know it's very easy to sort of lose
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
track of where we are
 
05:14:25.128 --> 05:14:25.138 align:start position:0%
um and when it comes to racial profiling
 
05:14:28.490 --> 05:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
I believe the time is right for a policy
 
05:14:31.208 --> 05:14:31.218 align:start position:0%
statement from US
 
05:14:34.128 --> 05:14:34.138 align:start position:0%
outlawing this practice in our state
 
05:14:36.410 --> 05:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
and uh with that I'll stop and take any
 
05:14:39.890 --> 05:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
questions that folks have
 
05:14:45.890 --> 05:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:48.530 --> 05:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious I know you come from
 
05:14:50.570 --> 05:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
the Seacoast I'm curious if you've ever
 
05:14:52.970 --> 05:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
had the experience of either being
 
05:14:54.650 --> 05:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
stopped for driving while away or
 
05:14:57.410 --> 05:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
stopped for shopping in a high-end store
 
05:14:59.448 --> 05:14:59.458 align:start position:0%
for being a white man going through the
 
05:14:59.458 --> 05:15:00.470 align:start position:0%
for being a white man going through the
store

05:15:00.470 --> 05:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
store
 
05:15:02.330 --> 05:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
I I have not
 
05:15:04.550 --> 05:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
um but I will relate an experience I had
 
05:15:06.890 --> 05:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
to you just last night I'm not quite
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
sure I should be relating this to you
 
05:15:12.850 --> 05:15:12.860 align:start position:0%
but when I came through uh TSA I was uh
 
05:15:15.650 --> 05:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
I spent the last week traveling out of
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
the country and when I came back in
 
05:15:19.150 --> 05:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
through customs
 
05:15:22.430 --> 05:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
the gentleman took my passport and asked
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
me what's what's the password and then
 
05:15:27.410 --> 05:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
going password
 
05:15:31.550 --> 05:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and he he said yeah you had your
 
05:15:33.530 --> 05:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
I have a notation here that you had your
 
05:15:36.770 --> 05:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
identity stolen a few years ago and uh
 
05:15:37.970 --> 05:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
you were asked to create a password
 
05:15:40.430 --> 05:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
which I see you did
 
05:15:40.440 --> 05:15:41.150 align:start position:0%
which I see you did
um

05:15:41.150 --> 05:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:43.910 --> 05:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
what he did was very nice of him was he
 
05:15:45.530 --> 05:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
gave me hints
 
05:15:48.530 --> 05:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
and what that did was it saved me from
 
05:15:51.050 --> 05:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
actually having to stand by a wall and
 
05:15:52.550 --> 05:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
wait for another officer to take me
 
05:15:54.530 --> 05:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
downstairs and interrogate me for an
 
05:15:54.540 --> 05:15:55.810 align:start position:0%
downstairs and interrogate me for an
hour

05:15:55.810 --> 05:15:55.820 align:start position:0%
hour
 
05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the gentleman who was in
 
05:16:01.850 --> 05:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
front of me uh was black and one of the
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
things and essentially we we couldn't
 
05:16:06.830 --> 05:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
hear the conversation but the part of it
 
05:16:09.350 --> 05:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
that we could hear was that he evidently
 
05:16:12.170 --> 05:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
was carrying uh some vegetables or
 
05:16:14.530 --> 05:16:14.540 align:start position:0%
fruits in from an from another country
 
05:16:19.490 --> 05:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh and uh he was basically told the
 
05:16:23.628 --> 05:16:23.638 align:start position:0%
stand by the wall and uh he was there
 
05:16:25.390 --> 05:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
when we left
 
05:16:25.400 --> 05:16:27.110 align:start position:0%
when we left
and

05:16:27.110 --> 05:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:29.930 --> 05:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
you know his the treatment of the
 
05:16:32.030 --> 05:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
officer towards that gentleman may have
 
05:16:33.530 --> 05:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
been perfectly appropriate given the
 
05:16:37.368 --> 05:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
fact that he uh that he uh
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh that he evidently was carrying some
 
05:16:42.650 --> 05:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
things that he wasn't supposed to carry
 
05:16:45.650 --> 05:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
but what was probably inappropriate
 
05:16:47.930 --> 05:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
was the fact that he kind of gave me a
 
05:16:47.940 --> 05:16:49.970 align:start position:0%
was the fact that he kind of gave me a
pass

05:16:49.970 --> 05:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:16:52.010 --> 05:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
um that I'm not sure that other people
 
05:16:54.170 --> 05:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
would have gotten
 
05:16:57.890 --> 05:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and on the one hand when you're the
 
05:17:00.350 --> 05:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
recipient of that you're you're grateful
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
for it you know it was nice not to have
 
05:17:04.910 --> 05:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
to wait around the airport for another
 
05:17:08.270 --> 05:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
hour at 11 30 at night
 
05:17:10.550 --> 05:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
um on the other hand
 
05:17:12.708 --> 05:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
um you know you just wonder
 
05:17:15.530 --> 05:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
um that not everybody gets that kind of
 
05:17:17.208 --> 05:17:17.218 align:start position:0%
treatment and I think that's one of the
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
things we we have to
 
05:17:22.850 --> 05:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
kind of ask ourselves you know you know
 
05:17:25.910 --> 05:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to to this sort of sort of
 
05:17:27.550 --> 05:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
question I mean
 
05:17:31.070 --> 05:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
this is something that's so outside of
 
05:17:33.948 --> 05:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
our experiences and and the way we were
 
05:17:35.750 --> 05:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
treated by law enforcement the way I'm
 
05:17:40.070 --> 05:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
treated as a as a 66 year old white man
 
05:17:42.770 --> 05:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
um is very very different
 
05:17:46.128 --> 05:17:46.138 align:start position:0%
um and but but I think the fact that
 
05:17:49.128 --> 05:17:49.138 align:start position:0%
that we are treated well and differently
 
05:17:51.788 --> 05:17:51.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we shouldn't
 
05:17:54.350 --> 05:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
be thinking of people
 
05:17:57.530 --> 05:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
who are not white who who may be treated
 
05:17:57.540 --> 05:17:58.690 align:start position:0%
who are not white who who may be treated
differently

05:17:58.690 --> 05:17:58.700 align:start position:0%
differently
 
05:18:03.288 --> 05:18:03.298 align:start position:0%
and to take the provisions uh in the law
 
05:18:06.948 --> 05:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
to ensure that everybody's treated uh
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
treated equally
 
05:18:08.878 --> 05:18:09.470 align:start position:0%
treated equally
um

05:18:09.470 --> 05:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:15.050 --> 05:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:17.868 --> 05:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
so the answer was no
 
05:18:17.878 --> 05:18:22.730 align:start position:0%
so the answer was no
sorry

05:18:22.730 --> 05:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
05:18:26.690 --> 05:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
no representative Manion
 
05:18:28.128 --> 05:18:28.138 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:18:29.448 --> 05:18:29.458 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:18:30.890 --> 05:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
my questions about the first part of
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
this who would make that determination
 
05:18:35.628 --> 05:18:35.638 align:start position:0%
that racial profiling was used I'm sorry
 
05:18:37.850 --> 05:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
make the determining who what who would
 
05:18:39.410 --> 05:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
make that determination that racial
 
05:18:41.810 --> 05:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
profiling was in fact used uh when
 
05:18:44.030 --> 05:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
determining whether it was summons or an
 
05:18:47.690 --> 05:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
arrest and if that is made can that
 
05:18:49.368 --> 05:18:49.378 align:start position:0%
affect the outcome of the case
 
05:18:52.550 --> 05:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
what the spill effectively does is
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
um I think what we try to try to do was
 
05:18:57.230 --> 05:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
avoid some of the minutia of of
 
05:19:00.170 --> 05:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
quantifying it and and getting into
 
05:19:02.330 --> 05:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
those issues what we're essentially
 
05:19:04.730 --> 05:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
doing is making a policy statement that
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
says this practice is unacceptable in
 
05:19:09.410 --> 05:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or is no longer acceptable
 
05:19:11.570 --> 05:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire in the same way it's no
 
05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
longer acceptable and that over 30 other
 
05:19:17.810 --> 05:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
states so what I would say unlike a lot
 
05:19:20.510 --> 05:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the the you know the the bills that
 
05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
we that we do uh this one is more of a
 
05:19:28.010 --> 05:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
policy statement and once we have this
 
05:19:30.410 --> 05:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
policy statement and statute you know
 
05:19:32.690 --> 05:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
and we've we've defined racial you know
 
05:19:34.570 --> 05:19:34.580 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it does Define
 
05:19:38.170 --> 05:19:38.180 align:start position:0%
profiling and it does specifically
 
05:19:41.628 --> 05:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
identify uh prohibitions you know things
 
05:19:43.368 --> 05:19:43.378 align:start position:0%
you know things that are things that are
 
05:19:43.378 --> 05:19:45.230 align:start position:0%
you know things that are things that are
prohibited

05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think once that we once we have
 
05:19:50.690 --> 05:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
that uh it will be a little bit easier
 
05:19:53.690 --> 05:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
for us to figure eight figure out things
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
like what is the best way to identify uh
 
05:19:58.970 --> 05:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
the data
 
05:20:02.930 --> 05:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
um you know that could uh support
 
05:20:04.430 --> 05:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
um you know the presence of racial
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
profiling and a stop
 
05:20:10.430 --> 05:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
um uh and I I also feel
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
confident in given how widespread this
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
legislation has been around the the
 
05:20:21.050 --> 05:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
country and also given the the training
 
05:20:22.970 --> 05:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
skills that are police standards and
 
05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
training group has uh has shown I think
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
you know not only since the passage of
 
05:20:31.010 --> 05:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
Leah or the recommendations of Leah
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
committee but but also you know prior to
 
05:20:33.240 --> 05:20:34.610 align:start position:0%
committee but but also you know prior to
that

05:20:34.610 --> 05:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
um uh I I feel I feel confident that
 
05:20:41.628 --> 05:20:41.638 align:start position:0%
once we have the policy statement down
 
05:20:46.330 --> 05:20:46.340 align:start position:0%
um the training that's provided will
 
05:20:49.190 --> 05:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
essentially help Law Enforcement
 
05:20:51.650 --> 05:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
Officers figure out how to carry out
 
05:20:53.628 --> 05:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
that policy
 
05:20:56.270 --> 05:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
so long answer but
 
05:20:59.208 --> 05:20:59.218 align:start position:0%
um I I feel confident in the ability of
 
05:21:01.610 --> 05:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
our of the of the folks that we have
 
05:21:04.550 --> 05:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
doing that job uh to help officers make
 
05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
that determination and if there are
 
05:21:08.990 --> 05:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
clarifications uh that they that they
 
05:21:10.368 --> 05:21:10.378 align:start position:0%
need I would hope that they would come
 
05:21:12.070 --> 05:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
to us if they if they need
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
clarifications and statute if they think
 
05:21:16.368 --> 05:21:16.378 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful I would hope that
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:43.490 --> 05:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and members
 
05:21:45.288 --> 05:21:45.298 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Jane Graham
 
05:21:46.788 --> 05:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
I'm the Strategic Communications
 
05:21:48.050 --> 05:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
administrator for the New Hampshire
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections thank you for
 
05:21:53.110 --> 05:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak today regarding HB
 
05:21:55.970 --> 05:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
596. the Department of Corrections is
 
05:21:59.150 --> 05:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to HB 596fn as it's currently
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
written the department does not have
 
05:22:03.050 --> 05:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
objections to the intent of this bill
 
05:22:05.208 --> 05:22:05.218 align:start position:0%
however the reporting requirements are
 
05:22:07.430 --> 05:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
problematic for our department it would
 
05:22:09.470 --> 05:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
require us to create an additional
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
position in order to comply with the law
 
05:22:14.270 --> 05:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections currently
 
05:22:16.610 --> 05:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
collects and reports out certain data on
 
05:22:19.010 --> 05:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
its resident population in fact the
 
05:22:20.448 --> 05:22:20.458 align:start position:0%
department is one of the few state
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
agencies required by law
 
05:22:24.890 --> 05:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
to complete an annual report rather than
 
05:22:26.628 --> 05:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
a semi-annual one
 
05:22:30.288 --> 05:22:30.298 align:start position:0%
much of the data requested in HB 596fn
 
05:22:32.628 --> 05:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
is included in our annual report however
 
05:22:34.430 --> 05:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
this data does not currently conform to
 
05:22:36.230 --> 05:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
all of the reporting requirements that
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
are outlined in this bill
 
05:22:41.150 --> 05:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
while the department is currently able
 
05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
to report information on a resident's
 
05:22:45.650 --> 05:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
minimum and maximum sentences our
 
05:22:48.288 --> 05:22:48.298 align:start position:0%
software offender management system is
 
05:22:50.330 --> 05:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
unable to separate consecutive sentences
 
05:22:52.730 --> 05:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
the department would need to add this
 
05:22:54.770 --> 05:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
option and potentially other features to
 
05:22:56.930 --> 05:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
our current program to to comply with
 
05:22:58.730 --> 05:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
this bill which would result in
 
05:23:00.890 --> 05:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
increased cost to the Department
 
05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
an exact amount for this is
 
05:23:04.910 --> 05:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
indeterminable at this point we would
 
05:23:08.810 --> 05:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
have to work on that with our vendor the
 
05:23:10.970 --> 05:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
department is concerned with the
 
05:23:14.030 --> 05:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
language included on page two lines 16
 
05:23:16.010 --> 05:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
through 20 of the bill
 
05:23:18.650 --> 05:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
which states the report shall include
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
research and gather relative relevant
 
05:23:23.650 --> 05:23:23.660 align:start position:0%
statistical data and other information
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
concerning the existence and impact of
 
05:23:28.610 --> 05:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
disparate treatment of non-white persons
 
05:23:30.708 --> 05:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
in the facilities under the control of
 
05:23:32.208 --> 05:23:32.218 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
05:23:34.730 --> 05:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
Corrections the language in this portion
 
05:23:36.530 --> 05:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
of the legislation is vague and it is
 
05:23:38.090 --> 05:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
unclear what other information is
 
05:23:40.128 --> 05:23:40.138 align:start position:0%
required that would indicate the
 
05:23:42.110 --> 05:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
existence and impact of disparate
 
05:23:43.850 --> 05:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
treatment of non-white persons in the
 
05:23:45.948 --> 05:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
facilities the department is unable to
 
05:23:47.930 --> 05:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
speculate on what information may be
 
05:23:49.550 --> 05:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
necessary to comply with the section of
 
05:23:51.170 --> 05:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
the bill and whether that information
 
05:23:53.150 --> 05:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
would be available to us
 
05:23:55.190 --> 05:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
while the department of corrections may
 
05:23:58.190 --> 05:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
be able to obtain data on race this data
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
will not allow for a comparative
 
05:24:03.110 --> 05:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
analysis on sentencing the details and
 
05:24:05.090 --> 05:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
fact pattern presented for each case
 
05:24:07.730 --> 05:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
that was used in the determination of a
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
sentence will not be available or
 
05:24:12.110 --> 05:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
accessible for the Department making a
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
complete analysis of racial disparity in
 
05:24:16.490 --> 05:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
sentencing impossible for our agency to
 
05:24:16.500 --> 05:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
sentencing impossible for our agency to
determine

05:24:17.510 --> 05:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
determine
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
the department is also unable to account
 
05:24:21.650 --> 05:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
for an individual who's a repeat
 
05:24:23.690 --> 05:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
offender and whose previous offense
 
05:24:25.310 --> 05:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
history may have impacted their current
 
05:24:26.750 --> 05:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
sentence length
 
05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections expertise
 
05:24:30.350 --> 05:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
is that the audits division of the
 
05:24:31.970 --> 05:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
office of the legislative budget
 
05:24:33.590 --> 05:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
assistant may be more appropriately
 
05:24:35.628 --> 05:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
staffed and trained to be able to
 
05:24:37.330 --> 05:24:37.340 align:start position:0%
collect and analyze the information
 
05:24:39.170 --> 05:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
necessary to complete what is
 
05:24:40.730 --> 05:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
accomplished in this bill
 
05:24:42.530 --> 05:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections recognizes
 
05:24:44.208 --> 05:24:44.218 align:start position:0%
and appreciates the intent of this bill
 
05:24:46.010 --> 05:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
to combat racial profiling and law
 
05:24:47.628 --> 05:24:47.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement activities and sentencing
 
05:24:49.670 --> 05:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
however we feel there are logistical
 
05:24:52.190 --> 05:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be addressed I would
 
05:24:53.448 --> 05:24:53.458 align:start position:0%
like to thank the committee for this
 
05:24:55.730 --> 05:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity today and I'm happy to
 
05:25:00.788 --> 05:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:07.368 --> 05:25:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:09.170 --> 05:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
is this
 
05:25:11.628 --> 05:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh is thank you and thank you for taking
 
05:25:13.070 --> 05:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:25:15.288 --> 05:25:15.298 align:start position:0%
um is there a possibility of an
 
05:25:17.930 --> 05:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
amendment that might be uh
 
05:25:20.690 --> 05:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
I yes absolutely I I think we could work
 
05:25:22.490 --> 05:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
on an amendment that would address some
 
05:25:25.610 --> 05:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
of these concerns and make us able to to
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
do this because we we are able to
 
05:25:29.330 --> 05:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of this information it's
 
05:25:32.390 --> 05:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
just that it's raw data information
 
05:25:34.250 --> 05:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
um and we would probably need to tweak
 
05:25:35.948 --> 05:25:35.958 align:start position:0%
our system a little bit for some of it
 
05:25:38.930 --> 05:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks
 
05:25:41.448 --> 05:25:41.458 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
05:25:41.458 --> 05:25:46.670 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
okay

05:25:46.670 --> 05:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:50.090 --> 05:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative Newman thank you
 
05:25:50.100 --> 05:25:50.690 align:start position:0%
representative Newman thank you
um

05:25:50.690 --> 05:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:53.270 --> 05:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
so I I understand your testimony to be
 
05:25:55.910 --> 05:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
that that your the Department of
 
05:25:58.010 --> 05:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
Correction is opposed to the bill
 
05:26:00.530 --> 05:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
but I just want to clarify that a little
 
05:26:04.010 --> 05:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
bit is it true that you are opposed to
 
05:26:05.510 --> 05:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
the bill but it has to do with the
 
05:26:07.250 --> 05:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
collection you don't you may not be
 
05:26:08.990 --> 05:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to the collection of the data
 
05:26:10.850 --> 05:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
there may be some other place where the
 
05:26:13.368 --> 05:26:13.378 align:start position:0%
data could be processed and become
 
05:26:16.010 --> 05:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
available absolutely and we collect a
 
05:26:18.110 --> 05:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
lot of the data that's in this bill and
 
05:26:20.868 --> 05:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
we actually provided it to the committee
 
05:26:23.090 --> 05:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
um in our introductory meeting we also
 
05:26:25.070 --> 05:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
provide it in our annual report for the
 
05:26:27.708 --> 05:26:27.718 align:start position:0%
most part there are some some pieces of
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
information that we would
 
05:26:33.230 --> 05:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
um need to work on our system our
 
05:26:34.850 --> 05:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
offender management system to be able to
 
05:26:37.128 --> 05:26:37.138 align:start position:0%
get and I'm not I'm not sure like how
 
05:26:38.390 --> 05:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
much money that would take or what
 
05:26:39.590 --> 05:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
changes would need to be made because
 
05:26:41.628 --> 05:26:41.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not the technical person
 
05:26:46.430 --> 05:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
um but we we can provide a lot of it
 
05:26:48.410 --> 05:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:26:50.868 --> 05:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
so is it correct to understand that if
 
05:26:53.750 --> 05:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
someone else collected it processed it
 
05:26:55.490 --> 05:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
and it was then available you could then
 
05:26:57.410 --> 05:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
include it in your report is that it
 
05:26:59.810 --> 05:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
might but I I think the bigger problem
 
05:27:02.570 --> 05:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
for us is not the data collection itself
 
05:27:05.390 --> 05:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
but it's the analysis of the data for
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
05:27:14.270 --> 05:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:27:14.280 --> 05:27:38.090 align:start position:0%
thank you

um you've heard a lot of testimony today
 
05:28:00.650 --> 05:28:00.660 align:start position:0%
as uh from representative Muse as to uh
 
05:28:02.510 --> 05:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
the history and concerns of where this
 
05:28:04.610 --> 05:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
bill is originating from so I don't I
 
05:28:07.550 --> 05:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to um rehash that out what I
 
05:28:09.650 --> 05:28:09.660 align:start position:0%
instead wanted to do was just talk about
 
05:28:13.368 --> 05:28:13.378 align:start position:0%
three things specifically regarding the
 
05:28:15.410 --> 05:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
need for for this
 
05:28:15.420 --> 05:28:16.070 align:start position:0%
need for for this
um

05:28:16.070 --> 05:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:19.788 --> 05:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
it took up to last year 2022 for racist
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
comments and racist speech to officially
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
be added to the definition of misconduct
 
05:28:27.230 --> 05:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement in New Hampshire and
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
um I and I'll let that one sink in it
 
05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
took up to 2022 for that to officially
 
05:28:33.410 --> 05:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
be recognized as misconduct and that's
 
05:28:35.750 --> 05:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
stemming from situations that have
 
05:28:37.250 --> 05:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
occurred in New Hampshire
 
05:28:38.690 --> 05:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
um you know I will stick to New
 
05:28:41.628 --> 05:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific cases including uh
 
05:28:44.690 --> 05:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
Aaron Brown horn
 
05:28:46.070 --> 05:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
um as well as a situation out of
 
05:28:48.410 --> 05:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth who a personal friend of mine
 
05:28:50.330 --> 05:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
was called the n-word by a police
 
05:28:52.250 --> 05:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
officer ended up reporting that to the
 
05:28:54.590 --> 05:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth PD I didn't end up going
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere he ended up committing suicide
 
05:28:58.430 --> 05:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
months later
 
05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
there is another situation that was
 
05:29:02.030 --> 05:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
personally brought up to us
 
05:29:04.250 --> 05:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
um by an individual in the community who
 
05:29:07.788 --> 05:29:07.798 align:start position:0%
went through uh filing that went through
 
05:29:10.610 --> 05:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
the entire process and having it sworn
 
05:29:13.430 --> 05:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
under oath of a situation that he went
 
05:29:15.708 --> 05:29:15.718 align:start position:0%
through with a police department where
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
during the course of his stop he was
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
called the n-word swore under oath
 
05:29:21.890 --> 05:29:21.900 align:start position:0%
filled it out paid for an attorney had
 
05:29:24.530 --> 05:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
this sent his complaint sent to the
 
05:29:28.250 --> 05:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice who their response
 
05:29:31.368 --> 05:29:31.378 align:start position:0%
um to it was uh they have reviewed the
 
05:29:33.050 --> 05:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
complaint filed on behalf of the client
 
05:29:34.610 --> 05:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
and although the complaint alleges that
 
05:29:37.070 --> 05:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
the conduct of the police department was
 
05:29:40.128 --> 05:29:40.138 align:start position:0%
motivated by Mr so-and-so's race it does
 
05:29:42.170 --> 05:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
not allege a violation of the New
 
05:29:43.910 --> 05:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law against discrimination
 
05:29:45.590 --> 05:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
which with the exception of public
 
05:29:47.930 --> 05:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
education institutions does not have a
 
05:29:49.430 --> 05:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
provision that in this context applies
 
05:29:52.250 --> 05:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
to government agencies or actors the
 
05:29:54.770 --> 05:29:54.780 align:start position:0%
complaint also does not appear to allege
 
05:29:56.990 --> 05:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
an actual or threatened race use of
 
05:29:59.750 --> 05:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
force against Mr so-and-so designed to
 
05:30:01.550 --> 05:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
interfere with his lawful actions or his
 
05:30:04.850 --> 05:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
rights therefore the unit will take no
 
05:30:06.590 --> 05:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
further action that's from the
 
05:30:07.788 --> 05:30:07.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice that was a
 
05:30:08.990 --> 05:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
response that was sent back to our
 
05:30:09.000 --> 05:30:10.430 align:start position:0%
response that was sent back to our
client

05:30:10.430 --> 05:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
client
 
05:30:13.730 --> 05:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
there is a need to ban racial profiling
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or to explicitly name
 
05:30:16.670 --> 05:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
it and I'm just going to just end this
 
05:30:19.610 --> 05:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
with what um I had posed to the
 
05:30:22.550 --> 05:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
commission uh on liac
 
05:30:24.948 --> 05:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
does any do any of the decision makers
 
05:30:27.708 --> 05:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
at the table believe that racial
 
05:30:29.690 --> 05:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
profiling should be banned in New
 
05:30:29.700 --> 05:30:31.010 align:start position:0%
profiling should be banned in New
Hampshire

05:30:31.010 --> 05:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:30:32.990 --> 05:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
05:30:34.850 --> 05:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
what's the hold up
 
05:30:36.590 --> 05:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
that that's that's really what this
 
05:30:38.810 --> 05:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
boils down to is whether or not we're
 
05:30:40.430 --> 05:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
going to send the message to the
 
05:30:42.050 --> 05:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
communities to all the community members
 
05:30:44.270 --> 05:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
that we have in the state that that
 
05:30:46.730 --> 05:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
their concerns are heard and that this
 
05:30:48.050 --> 05:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
is gonna we're gonna have a zero
 
05:30:49.850 --> 05:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
tolerance policy in this state when it
 
05:30:51.288 --> 05:30:51.298 align:start position:0%
comes to it
 
05:30:53.448 --> 05:30:53.458 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions anyone
 
05:30:56.750 --> 05:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:59.750 --> 05:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative selik
 
05:31:02.270 --> 05:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and um I apologize in advance
 
05:31:04.368 --> 05:31:04.378 align:start position:0%
if my question is offensive it's the
 
05:31:05.868 --> 05:31:05.878 align:start position:0%
same question I asked representative
 
05:31:05.878 --> 05:31:07.310 align:start position:0%
same question I asked representative
Muse

05:31:07.310 --> 05:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
Muse
 
05:31:09.110 --> 05:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
um have you been stopped for driving
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
while black or stop or followed well for
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:17.810 --> 05:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
um the charge wasn't I I guess the the
 
05:31:19.250 --> 05:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
officer didn't say I was being pulled
 
05:31:21.708 --> 05:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
over for driving while black but I did I
 
05:31:23.930 --> 05:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
did bring up a situation where I was
 
05:31:25.910 --> 05:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
leaving my Concord office and traveling
 
05:31:28.368 --> 05:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
to the Manchester one I had recently
 
05:31:31.368 --> 05:31:31.378 align:start position:0%
purchased a new vehicle it was a
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
high-end Mercedes-Benz and since I
 
05:31:34.788 --> 05:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
purchased that vehicle I've been stopped
 
05:31:36.590 --> 05:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
three separate times
 
05:31:39.410 --> 05:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
um all four alleged violations that did
 
05:31:41.390 --> 05:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
not end in tickets or warrants but was
 
05:31:43.128 --> 05:31:43.138 align:start position:0%
uh they were asking me questions
 
05:31:45.170 --> 05:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
including what I was doing where I was
 
05:31:48.650 --> 05:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
going one of the officers asked me if I
 
05:31:50.448 --> 05:31:50.458 align:start position:0%
had traveled that road the day before to
 
05:31:51.770 --> 05:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
which I told them no must have been a
 
05:31:53.570 --> 05:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
different black person in the white bins
 
05:31:56.030 --> 05:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
and he said yeah it must have been
 
05:31:59.570 --> 05:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
um and then uh following that situation
 
05:32:01.970 --> 05:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
which I did feel that I was profiled on
 
05:32:04.550 --> 05:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
I requested that um
 
05:32:06.530 --> 05:32:06.540 align:start position:0%

05:32:24.350 --> 05:32:24.360 align:start position:0%

please do the content that the bill and
 
05:32:45.708 --> 05:32:45.718 align:start position:0%
ask the question because of the color of
 
05:32:47.690 --> 05:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
his skin I'm wondering whether you've
 
05:32:50.690 --> 05:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
had similar experiences
 
05:32:50.700 --> 05:32:51.708 align:start position:0%
had similar experiences
um

05:32:51.708 --> 05:32:51.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:53.750 --> 05:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm from this state originally I'm born
 
05:32:55.128 --> 05:32:55.138 align:start position:0%
and raised in the states so my
 
05:32:57.170 --> 05:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
experiences are all from here I will say
 
05:32:59.208 --> 05:32:59.218 align:start position:0%
this that uh during the liat commission
 
05:33:01.250 --> 05:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony from individuals
 
05:33:03.170 --> 05:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
on that there was
 
05:33:05.690 --> 05:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
um specifically uh the New Hampshire
 
05:33:07.070 --> 05:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
Association of criminal defense lawyers
 
05:33:09.230 --> 05:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
presented some cases involving
 
05:33:12.230 --> 05:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
um I believe uh the U.S US versus Garcia
 
05:33:15.890 --> 05:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
U.S verse Perez uh two Perez's as a
 
05:33:17.390 --> 05:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
matter of fact U.S versus Jones these
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
were all minorities who were traveling
 
05:33:22.788 --> 05:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
the highways and the state police used a
 
05:33:26.448 --> 05:33:26.458 align:start position:0%
unit called The Met to uh use pretextual
 
05:33:28.550 --> 05:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
stops to pull people over to expand the
 
05:33:31.070 --> 05:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
scope of the of the stock and these
 
05:33:32.990 --> 05:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
individuals were all pulled over for you
 
05:33:34.550 --> 05:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
know driving with their hands at 10 and
 
05:33:37.190 --> 05:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
2 on the steering wheel in one case the
 
05:33:38.690 --> 05:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
officer said that he found it suspicious
 
05:33:40.970 --> 05:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
that they were speaking Spanish during
 
05:33:43.250 --> 05:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
the the traffic stop I don't know what's
 
05:33:46.010 --> 05:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
suspicious about that but uh those that
 
05:33:47.628 --> 05:33:47.638 align:start position:0%
did happen and those were documented
 
05:33:49.550 --> 05:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
cases in all these cases
 
05:33:51.650 --> 05:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
um the courts uh ended up suppressing
 
05:33:53.868 --> 05:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
using the evidence in granting their
 
05:33:53.878 --> 05:34:01.670 align:start position:0%
using the evidence in granting their
relief

05:34:01.670 --> 05:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:07.190 --> 05:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:24.310 --> 05:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:27.050 --> 05:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam Vice chair members
 
05:34:28.128 --> 05:34:28.138 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Miles
 
05:34:30.170 --> 05:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
Madison I'm the chief of the criminal
 
05:34:32.090 --> 05:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
justice Bureau at the Department of
 
05:34:32.100 --> 05:34:33.770 align:start position:0%
justice Bureau at the Department of
Justice

05:34:33.770 --> 05:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
05:34:35.510 --> 05:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
um I speak just on the the narrow
 
05:34:37.430 --> 05:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
section of the bill the five lines today
 
05:34:39.650 --> 05:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
relating to the attorney general's
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements under this
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
legislation so just some some comment on
 
05:34:47.690 --> 05:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
on those lines at the bottom of uh the
 
05:34:51.110 --> 05:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
first page top of the of page two
 
05:34:53.150 --> 05:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
um we would note that the resource
 
05:34:55.970 --> 05:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
obligations that would be placed on the
 
05:34:57.470 --> 05:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office under this
 
05:35:00.410 --> 05:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
legislation are uncertain and uh
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
potentially burdensome because of the
 
05:35:06.288 --> 05:35:06.298 align:start position:0%
scope of the obligation is not is not
 
05:35:08.270 --> 05:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
particularly defined there are two
 
05:35:10.010 --> 05:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
categories of information that would be
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
included in a report mandated by this
 
05:35:16.250 --> 05:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
legislation and but the sourcing of that
 
05:35:18.650 --> 05:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
that information or data is is not
 
05:35:20.270 --> 05:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
particularly clear under the the
 
05:35:23.690 --> 05:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
language of this text
 
05:35:23.700 --> 05:35:25.010 align:start position:0%
language of this text
uh

05:35:25.010 --> 05:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:35:28.430 --> 05:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
the bill isn't specific as to how the
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
Attorney General would attorney general
 
05:35:32.628 --> 05:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
would execute its obligations relating
 
05:35:35.090 --> 05:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
to that reporting requirement so it
 
05:35:37.850 --> 05:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
appears to require steps or collection
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
of data that is not currently authorized
 
05:35:44.270 --> 05:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:46.430 --> 05:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
and where that collection of that type
 
05:35:49.010 --> 05:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
of data such as race and ethnicity
 
05:35:50.628 --> 05:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
relating to traffic stops or other
 
05:35:53.690 --> 05:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
complaints it is the subject of other
 
05:35:56.868 --> 05:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
discussions but this legislation doesn't
 
05:35:59.090 --> 05:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
lay out the pathway or the expectations
 
05:36:02.810 --> 05:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
for the creation and uh and cataloging
 
05:36:05.208 --> 05:36:05.218 align:start position:0%
of that information
 
05:36:07.250 --> 05:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
a couple of phrases to bring your
 
05:36:09.170 --> 05:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
attention to one is within available
 
05:36:11.150 --> 05:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
resources this legislation wouldn't make
 
05:36:13.070 --> 05:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
available any additional resources to
 
05:36:14.990 --> 05:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice
 
05:36:17.090 --> 05:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
um it's unclear whether that would
 
05:36:20.030 --> 05:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
result in a diminished report or no
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
reports depending on what the obligation
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
may be in collecting this data
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
synthesizing it and producing
 
05:36:27.600 --> 05:36:29.750 align:start position:0%
synthesizing it and producing
recommendations

05:36:29.750 --> 05:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
05:36:31.550 --> 05:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
when I'm speaking of the two different
 
05:36:34.070 --> 05:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
categories of information this
 
05:36:35.750 --> 05:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislation would appear to to be
 
05:36:37.970 --> 05:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
capturing the total number of traffic
 
05:36:40.368 --> 05:36:40.378 align:start position:0%
stops as one category and then also
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
complaints under this legislation or or
 
05:36:48.470 --> 05:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
section across the entirety of the state
 
05:36:50.510 --> 05:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
the total number of traffic traffic
 
05:36:52.250 --> 05:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
stops is a little bit clearer to
 
05:36:55.190 --> 05:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
determine what that may be there are
 
05:36:58.610 --> 05:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
there are records of traffic stops they
 
05:37:00.288 --> 05:37:00.298 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that they do not
 
05:37:02.510 --> 05:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
currently capture the data that would be
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
required under this legislation that is
 
05:37:08.270 --> 05:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh the race and ethnicity of the
 
05:37:11.090 --> 05:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
individual or individuals who may have
 
05:37:13.190 --> 05:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
been stopped it's my understanding that
 
05:37:15.050 --> 05:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
that happens in some circumstances such
 
05:37:17.150 --> 05:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
as if an individual who stopped has
 
05:37:19.850 --> 05:37:19.860 align:start position:0%
provided a self-identified provided that
 
05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
information as part of a driving record
 
05:37:25.368 --> 05:37:25.378 align:start position:0%
or other record but that a significant
 
05:37:28.190 --> 05:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
portion of those records do not contain
 
05:37:31.490 --> 05:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
race or ethnicity data and so therefore
 
05:37:33.708 --> 05:37:33.718 align:start position:0%
if it is a requirement then law
 
05:37:36.110 --> 05:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials may be having to
 
05:37:39.770 --> 05:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
one either identify an individual and
 
05:37:43.550 --> 05:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
try to define the race and ethnicity of
 
05:37:46.250 --> 05:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
that individual or as part of a traffic
 
05:37:48.410 --> 05:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
stop or interaction
 
05:37:50.930 --> 05:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
ask someone what their race and
 
05:37:53.090 --> 05:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
ethnicity are and then record that for
 
05:37:55.368 --> 05:37:55.378 align:start position:0%
subsequent reporting
 
05:37:58.970 --> 05:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
the second category of complaints is is
 
05:38:02.208 --> 05:38:02.218 align:start position:0%
unclear what's envisioned to hear
 
05:38:02.218 --> 05:38:03.590 align:start position:0%
unclear what's envisioned to hear
um

05:38:03.590 --> 05:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:07.730 --> 05:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
it could be any references to any law
 
05:38:11.030 --> 05:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency across the state uh
 
05:38:12.230 --> 05:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to the Attorney General's
 
05:38:16.190 --> 05:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
office now how to compile track or
 
05:38:20.050 --> 05:38:20.060 align:start position:0%
compel law enforcement agencies to track
 
05:38:22.730 --> 05:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
and transmit that data to the Attorney
 
05:38:24.550 --> 05:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
General's office
 
05:38:27.050 --> 05:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
it just it's not spoken to in the
 
05:38:34.250 --> 05:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:34.260 --> 05:38:36.110 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:38:36.110 --> 05:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:38:38.570 --> 05:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
speaking a little bit to the the product
 
05:38:41.350 --> 05:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
that is required under this legislation
 
05:38:45.230 --> 05:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh it speaks to a report due July 1st of
 
05:38:48.650 --> 05:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
2024 which would be reporting on the
 
05:38:50.690 --> 05:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
results of any review of the the
 
05:38:52.850 --> 05:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
prevalence of traffic stops and
 
05:38:54.650 --> 05:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
complaints across the state and include
 
05:38:56.570 --> 05:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
recommendations there aren't any
 
05:38:58.490 --> 05:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
criteria in this legislation as
 
05:39:00.230 --> 05:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
currently drafted
 
05:39:00.240 --> 05:39:00.948 align:start position:0%
currently drafted
um

05:39:00.948 --> 05:39:00.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:03.350 --> 05:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
relating to what sorts of
 
05:39:05.208 --> 05:39:05.218 align:start position:0%
recommendations or what the objectives
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
are of that report so would note that
 
05:39:11.868 --> 05:39:11.878 align:start position:0%
this this language is is rather brief in
 
05:39:13.610 --> 05:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
terms of defining the role that the
 
05:39:15.948 --> 05:39:15.958 align:start position:0%
Attorney General would have what sort of
 
05:39:19.070 --> 05:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
data collection would be compelled under
 
05:39:21.050 --> 05:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
the obligations here but not spelled out
 
05:39:23.690 --> 05:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
in the legislation and then what the the
 
05:39:25.788 --> 05:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
goals of that reporting would be for the
 
05:39:27.890 --> 05:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to try to achieve so
 
05:39:35.470 --> 05:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you
 
05:39:38.638 --> 05:39:39.410 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you
yeah

05:39:39.410 --> 05:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:39:47.868 --> 05:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone again my name
 
05:39:52.390 --> 05:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
for the record is Joseph Ebert it's
 
05:39:54.708 --> 05:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
e-b-e-r-t I'm a major with the state
 
05:39:56.030 --> 05:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
police overseeing the Investigative
 
05:39:57.650 --> 05:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau
 
05:40:00.470 --> 05:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
so uh I wanted to start by making a
 
05:40:03.890 --> 05:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
clear declaration that we are clearly in
 
05:40:06.890 --> 05:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
support of there not being racial
 
05:40:08.390 --> 05:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
profiling within the state of New
 
05:40:11.628 --> 05:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I come to you today to
 
05:40:13.310 --> 05:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
discuss uh if I can direct your
 
05:40:18.410 --> 05:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
attention to page two uh line 20 and
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
this was part of the information brought
 
05:40:21.530 --> 05:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
forward by my colleague from the
 
05:40:23.510 --> 05:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections uh that
 
05:40:25.550 --> 05:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
statistical data shall include but not
 
05:40:26.868 --> 05:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
be limited to
 
05:40:29.750 --> 05:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
our recommendation would be where this
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill to move forward a specific carve
 
05:40:35.030 --> 05:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
out for a review of criminal history
 
05:40:37.368 --> 05:40:37.378 align:start position:0%
uh and a review of the facts and
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the crime so I think
 
05:40:42.410 --> 05:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
that what the purpose of this uh is
 
05:40:44.868 --> 05:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
pretty clear in looking for disparity in
 
05:40:47.690 --> 05:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
sentences uh what I would submit to you
 
05:40:49.730 --> 05:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
is oftentimes it's been my experience
 
05:40:52.250 --> 05:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
that a sentence can be impacted by the
 
05:40:54.288 --> 05:40:54.298 align:start position:0%
person's criminal record so I think
 
05:40:56.810 --> 05:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's really important to look at a
 
05:40:58.550 --> 05:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
person's criminal history and what their
 
05:41:01.190 --> 05:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
end sentence was the second thing I
 
05:41:03.530 --> 05:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
would submit to you is that there are
 
05:41:06.170 --> 05:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
times when somebody uh
 
05:41:09.410 --> 05:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
pleads guilty to a given offense takes
 
05:41:12.708 --> 05:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility and says I was wrong for
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
whatever reason I committed this offense
 
05:41:16.730 --> 05:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
and you know I throw myself at the mercy
 
05:41:17.930 --> 05:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
of the Court
 
05:41:20.650 --> 05:41:20.660 align:start position:0%
that person very well may end up being
 
05:41:23.150 --> 05:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
convicted of the same crime of somebody
 
05:41:26.810 --> 05:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
who says Nope I I show No Remorse I take
 
05:41:28.310 --> 05:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely no responsibility and of
 
05:41:29.690 --> 05:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
course that's the person's right to do
 
05:41:33.350 --> 05:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
so but I do think that that could have
 
05:41:36.230 --> 05:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
an impact on a sentence where you have
 
05:41:38.330 --> 05:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
somebody who comes forward and says I
 
05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
take full responsibility for my actions
 
05:41:40.320 --> 05:41:41.110 align:start position:0%
take full responsibility for my actions
and

05:41:41.110 --> 05:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:41:44.090 --> 05:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for whatever Act was
 
05:41:45.948 --> 05:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
committed so I think that there is there
 
05:41:47.330 --> 05:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
is something to be said to look at the
 
05:41:48.948 --> 05:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
facts and circumstances of the crime
 
05:41:51.170 --> 05:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
that was committed and also a review of
 
05:41:53.330 --> 05:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
the individual's criminal history the
 
05:41:56.810 --> 05:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
second thing that I I would recommend an
 
05:41:59.090 --> 05:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
addition of is the addition of the zip
 
05:42:00.550 --> 05:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
code of the offender
 
05:42:04.070 --> 05:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
so inevitably any information that is
 
05:42:05.690 --> 05:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
compiled like this any data that is
 
05:42:07.850 --> 05:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
compiled like this I think will be
 
05:42:10.788 --> 05:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
um there's a tendency to want to place
 
05:42:13.550 --> 05:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
that data against the composite of the
 
05:42:15.770 --> 05:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire so what what is
 
05:42:17.270 --> 05:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
the makeup of the State of New Hampshire
 
05:42:19.850 --> 05:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
what is the makeup of the prison system
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
and uh if there is disparity between the
 
05:42:24.050 --> 05:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
two why is there a disparity between the
 
05:42:27.410 --> 05:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
two I think uh New Hampshire as I uh
 
05:42:29.150 --> 05:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
testified in a similar but different
 
05:42:32.448 --> 05:42:32.458 align:start position:0%
bill is a transitory State it's
 
05:42:34.010 --> 05:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
transitory because people come here
 
05:42:36.350 --> 05:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
thankfully to spend their money and be
 
05:42:38.628 --> 05:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
tourists and enjoy everything that New
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has it's trans story because
 
05:42:42.050 --> 05:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
there are people who travel through
 
05:42:44.448 --> 05:42:44.458 align:start position:0%
headed to uh I'm from the Seacoast so
 
05:42:46.730 --> 05:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
quite oftentimes that 18 miles of the
 
05:42:47.990 --> 05:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire they're passing
 
05:42:50.570 --> 05:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
through just to get to Maine uh but uh
 
05:42:52.610 --> 05:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
there are also people who come to the
 
05:42:54.910 --> 05:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to commit crime
 
05:42:58.490 --> 05:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
we see this on I won't say on occasion
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
but we've certainly seen people who
 
05:43:02.208 --> 05:43:02.218 align:start position:0%
targeted uh businesses within the state
 
05:43:04.310 --> 05:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire or targeted a residents
 
05:43:05.390 --> 05:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire they
 
05:43:06.530 --> 05:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
just don't happen to be from New
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I think that's relevant
 
05:43:10.788 --> 05:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
information to collect if we're going to
 
05:43:11.750 --> 05:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
be collecting it we're going to be
 
05:43:12.890 --> 05:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
looking at it I think it's really
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
important to know where that offender is
 
05:43:15.120 --> 05:43:16.090 align:start position:0%
important to know where that offender is
from

05:43:16.090 --> 05:43:16.100 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
so that when it is applied to the
 
05:43:20.030 --> 05:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
statistics of the State of New Hampshire
 
05:43:22.910 --> 05:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
we can have a really clear picture of
 
05:43:25.070 --> 05:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
those individuals who are from the state
 
05:43:26.448 --> 05:43:26.458 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire what the makeup of the
 
05:43:28.310 --> 05:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire is and where
 
05:43:31.128 --> 05:43:31.138 align:start position:0%
people who are incarcerated in our
 
05:43:34.190 --> 05:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
prisons and our jails are from
 
05:43:37.368 --> 05:43:37.378 align:start position:0%
so with that I am happy to answer any
 
05:43:39.170 --> 05:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
questions you may have but I did want to
 
05:43:42.170 --> 05:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
Just One Last Time emphasize the notion
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
that we are in full support of the
 
05:43:47.708 --> 05:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:52.250 --> 05:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:54.288 --> 05:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
could you just comment or describe on
 
05:43:56.570 --> 05:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
because this bill talks about gathering
 
05:43:58.730 --> 05:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
information on non-white people and
 
05:44:03.470 --> 05:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
people of of color in the definitions
 
05:44:08.930 --> 05:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
just uh how difficult is it for the
 
05:44:11.590 --> 05:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
um State Police to collect information
 
05:44:14.570 --> 05:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
like when they went on the roadside and
 
05:44:16.850 --> 05:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
they're using a computer device after a
 
05:44:18.410 --> 05:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
person has been charged and things like
 
05:44:21.708 --> 05:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
that we went to a just a thing over at
 
05:44:24.288 --> 05:44:24.298 align:start position:0%
the State Police once where one is kind
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
of hard and the other one after after a
 
05:44:27.770 --> 05:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
certain thing happens
 
05:44:30.350 --> 05:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
people divulge that information to the
 
05:44:32.150 --> 05:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
state police could you just
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
sure some flesh on that absolutely I
 
05:44:35.390 --> 05:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
think I understand the uh the question
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative if I go uh far flung
 
05:44:41.330 --> 05:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
please feel free to bring me back in but
 
05:44:42.770 --> 05:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
um it is particularly difficult
 
05:44:45.230 --> 05:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh to determine a person's
 
05:44:47.030 --> 05:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
race without asking
 
05:44:51.770 --> 05:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh we find this in uh in and again I I'm
 
05:44:54.708 --> 05:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
here to testify on this bill but I I
 
05:44:56.810 --> 05:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
have testified before in similar bills
 
05:44:56.820 --> 05:44:57.770 align:start position:0%
have testified before in similar bills
that

05:44:57.770 --> 05:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:45:01.128 --> 05:45:01.138 align:start position:0%
there must be a way to credential a
 
05:45:02.868 --> 05:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
person's race I don't know what that is
 
05:45:06.350 --> 05:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
I I submit to you that it would make the
 
05:45:08.690 --> 05:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
life of the uh the officer the trooper
 
05:45:10.190 --> 05:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
the deputy who's dealing with somebody
 
05:45:12.230 --> 05:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
on the side of the road particularly
 
05:45:12.240 --> 05:45:13.788 align:start position:0%
on the side of the road particularly
easier

05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
easier
 
05:45:16.730 --> 05:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
um if if that was predetermined prior to
 
05:45:19.368 --> 05:45:19.378 align:start position:0%
that roadside interaction and by that I
 
05:45:21.770 --> 05:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
mean if you're writing a summons you can
 
05:45:25.548 --> 05:45:25.558 align:start position:0%
uh you can indicate what uh
 
05:45:27.470 --> 05:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
what race you believe the individual is
 
05:45:29.930 --> 05:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
or you can leave that field blank or
 
05:45:29.940 --> 05:45:31.788 align:start position:0%
or you can leave that field blank or
undetermined

05:45:31.788 --> 05:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
undetermined
 
05:45:34.010 --> 05:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
there has been a great deal of
 
05:45:37.788 --> 05:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
discussion over well is isn't it really
 
05:45:39.770 --> 05:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
what you want the officer's perception
 
05:45:41.868 --> 05:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
or the trooper's perception uh as to
 
05:45:45.110 --> 05:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
what that person uh what their race is
 
05:45:49.128 --> 05:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that is that I again I
 
05:45:52.490 --> 05:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
submit to perhaps that is the uh the
 
05:45:54.770 --> 05:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
best indicator is what that trooper's
 
05:45:56.208 --> 05:45:56.218 align:start position:0%
perception is
 
05:45:59.330 --> 05:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
however I'll tell you that um the
 
05:46:01.868 --> 05:46:01.878 align:start position:0%
difference between somebody who may be
 
05:46:04.970 --> 05:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
identified as Dominican or somebody who
 
05:46:08.208 --> 05:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
may identify as African-American to me
 
05:46:10.670 --> 05:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
may be difficult to tell the difference
 
05:46:13.730 --> 05:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
between uh but be maybe wildly offensive
 
05:46:16.010 --> 05:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
to the individual when I hand them a
 
05:46:18.650 --> 05:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
summons with the wrong either race or
 
05:46:21.650 --> 05:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
ethnicity on there so I would just
 
05:46:24.110 --> 05:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
submit to you that it's uh
 
05:46:26.390 --> 05:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's not easy and I don't think that
 
05:46:29.208 --> 05:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
there is a approve the proven
 
05:46:30.948 --> 05:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
methodology on how to determine that in
 
05:46:33.670 --> 05:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire but we are
 
05:46:38.990 --> 05:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:39.000 --> 05:46:40.448 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:46:40.448 --> 05:46:40.458 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:46:44.150 --> 05:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
I think I think your answer demonstrated
 
05:46:46.850 --> 05:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
the ability for anyone
 
05:46:50.570 --> 05:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
to to determine uh accurately just by
 
05:46:53.090 --> 05:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
Vision to do that
 
05:46:55.310 --> 05:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and and I think in that that display
 
05:46:57.410 --> 05:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
we had over at the state police state
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
they were very careful to say we don't
 
05:47:00.410 --> 05:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
want to be guessing
 
05:47:02.510 --> 05:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
and and I think my question was more
 
05:47:04.610 --> 05:47:04.620 align:start position:0%
designed towards on the roadside it
 
05:47:06.190 --> 05:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
sounded like you had a drop down menu
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
and it didn't have the right number of
 
05:47:10.730 --> 05:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
choices or maybe the choices that would
 
05:47:12.170 --> 05:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
help you do it even if you knew what it
 
05:47:14.110 --> 05:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
was you couldn't do it on the roadside
 
05:47:16.788 --> 05:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
but once they got to the station whether
 
05:47:19.070 --> 05:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
they said told you what their race was
 
05:47:21.890 --> 05:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
or or whatever you were able to at least
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
in some circumstances be able to
 
05:47:27.470 --> 05:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
determine the race of the individual
 
05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:34.368 --> 05:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think what you may be talking
 
05:47:35.990 --> 05:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
about there is uh when you when you take
 
05:47:38.330 --> 05:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
somebody into custody as opposed to when
 
05:47:39.890 --> 05:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
you write a summons so when you write a
 
05:47:41.810 --> 05:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
summons every everything is done right
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
there at the side of the road and uh
 
05:47:44.868 --> 05:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
whatever determination you're going to
 
05:47:47.390 --> 05:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
make in that race category is made uh at
 
05:47:49.970 --> 05:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
that moment uh when you take somebody
 
05:47:52.610 --> 05:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
into custody there is absolutely the
 
05:47:55.250 --> 05:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a much uh greater
 
05:47:57.530 --> 05:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
conversation with that individual uh
 
05:47:59.930 --> 05:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
perhaps they disclosed to you uh what
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
race or ethnicity they identify as or
 
05:48:04.670 --> 05:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's some other indicator to
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
you in the course of your conversation
 
05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
as to what that is so I think that may
 
05:48:10.430 --> 05:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
be what you're you're getting at is on
 
05:48:11.930 --> 05:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
the side of the road when you initially
 
05:48:13.610 --> 05:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
take somebody into custody do you know
 
05:48:15.948 --> 05:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
at that moment uh what their race and
 
05:48:18.830 --> 05:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
ethnicity is you may and you may not is
 
05:48:20.448 --> 05:48:20.458 align:start position:0%
the answer and you may have more
 
05:48:22.490 --> 05:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
information about that when you're back
 
05:48:24.830 --> 05:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
at the police department
 
05:48:28.430 --> 05:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:31.010 --> 05:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
Representative no
 
05:48:32.810 --> 05:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:48:32.820 --> 05:48:34.128 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:48:34.128 --> 05:48:34.138 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking about the concerns that
 
05:48:37.910 --> 05:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
both you and the Department of
 
05:48:39.410 --> 05:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
Corrections have
 
05:48:43.490 --> 05:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
um with the uh collection in in writing
 
05:48:45.650 --> 05:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
a report
 
05:48:48.230 --> 05:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
as regards what uh representative Newman
 
05:48:50.628 --> 05:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
was saying when you are collecting that
 
05:48:50.638 --> 05:48:52.250 align:start position:0%
was saying when you are collecting that
information

05:48:52.250 --> 05:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:48:55.610 --> 05:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
um does it not matter more uh what the
 
05:48:59.868 --> 05:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
officer's perception is rather than who
 
05:49:01.970 --> 05:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
you know what their actual ethnicity is
 
05:49:04.670 --> 05:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
I mean I would think that it would
 
05:49:07.368 --> 05:49:07.378 align:start position:0%
it would be yeah that would be the point
 
05:49:08.930 --> 05:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
of collecting it right is what the
 
05:49:11.510 --> 05:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
officers so uh uh thank you very much
 
05:49:14.150 --> 05:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
for the question and I think your your
 
05:49:17.270 --> 05:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
question is the uh is the question that
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think that collectively this uh
 
05:49:21.410 --> 05:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
this legislature has come to a
 
05:49:24.650 --> 05:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
conclusion on it's it is very difficult
 
05:49:27.170 --> 05:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
um it seems like uh when I have these
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
conversations about uh well is the right
 
05:49:32.330 --> 05:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
way then just when the person hands you
 
05:49:33.890 --> 05:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
the license there's an indicator on the
 
05:49:35.570 --> 05:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
license that tells you what their race
 
05:49:37.910 --> 05:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
is so it's done by the time you get to
 
05:49:41.390 --> 05:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
it uh but then I I've had similar
 
05:49:43.010 --> 05:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
conversations where people say but but
 
05:49:44.208 --> 05:49:44.218 align:start position:0%
that's not really what I want to know
 
05:49:46.610 --> 05:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
what I want to know is what is your
 
05:49:48.948 --> 05:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
perception of the individual that you've
 
05:49:50.628 --> 05:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
stopped uh and in those same
 
05:49:52.250 --> 05:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
conversations people say but you you
 
05:49:53.810 --> 05:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
know it's it's going to be wildly
 
05:49:56.510 --> 05:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
inaccurate so the the officer the
 
05:49:58.730 --> 05:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
trooper is going to uh he's going to
 
05:50:02.330 --> 05:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
make an assertion that in his mind he or
 
05:50:04.730 --> 05:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
her mind they think is correct it's just
 
05:50:07.310 --> 05:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't happen to be accurate so
 
05:50:07.320 --> 05:50:08.470 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't happen to be accurate so
uh

05:50:08.470 --> 05:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:50:11.570 --> 05:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
I I would love to answer your question I
 
05:50:14.628 --> 05:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
I think that the rest of the legislature
 
05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
would enjoy it very much if if we had a
 
05:50:19.548 --> 05:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
definitive answer but unfortunately I
 
05:50:20.810 --> 05:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
think that's that's what we're working
 
05:50:23.690 --> 05:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
toward is like what is the best way to
 
05:50:25.670 --> 05:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
capture that data because we're
 
05:50:27.650 --> 05:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
certainly supportive of looking at that
 
05:50:30.110 --> 05:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
data we want to be able to show that we
 
05:50:32.270 --> 05:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
have we don't have anything to hide that
 
05:50:34.730 --> 05:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
if somebody uh there was testimony
 
05:50:37.368 --> 05:50:37.378 align:start position:0%
earlier or there was a statement that if
 
05:50:38.930 --> 05:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
somebody is
 
05:50:41.448 --> 05:50:41.458 align:start position:0%
nervous to drive on the highway of the
 
05:50:42.708 --> 05:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire because of the
 
05:50:45.170 --> 05:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
color of their skin that's horrible we'd
 
05:50:46.670 --> 05:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
never want to see that and we want to be
 
05:50:48.890 --> 05:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
able to show the data that supports that
 
05:50:51.470 --> 05:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
that fear is irrational that is my my
 
05:50:52.970 --> 05:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
greatest hope is that we are able to
 
05:50:54.830 --> 05:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
show this data and say that's an
 
05:50:56.150 --> 05:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
irrational fear you don't have to have
 
05:50:57.650 --> 05:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
that fear you can travel in this state
 
05:50:59.628 --> 05:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
no matter who you are no matter when you
 
05:51:01.070 --> 05:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
want to travel no matter where you want
 
05:51:03.708 --> 05:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
to go it's the nuts and bolts of getting
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
to how are we able to get that accurate
 
05:51:10.490 --> 05:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
data and I don't know the I I personally
 
05:51:13.010 --> 05:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
don't know the specific answer to that
 
05:51:15.830 --> 05:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
can I ask a quick follow-up
 
05:51:18.530 --> 05:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
um very quickly is it is it possible to
 
05:51:22.128 --> 05:51:22.138 align:start position:0%
uh have a well I guess in the in the
 
05:51:23.868 --> 05:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
process does an officer create a report
 
05:51:26.570 --> 05:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
that is not actually uh something that
 
05:51:28.070 --> 05:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
is shared with
 
05:51:30.350 --> 05:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
um the the person who's being charged
 
05:51:32.750 --> 05:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know to be able to collect that
 
05:51:36.170 --> 05:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
information without uh the what you're
 
05:51:38.208 --> 05:51:38.218 align:start position:0%
saying is the concern of misdiagnosed
 
05:51:40.970 --> 05:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
you know uh misascertaining yeah so uh
 
05:51:44.330 --> 05:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I I think what you're saying
 
05:51:46.310 --> 05:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
is uh so how do you make that
 
05:51:49.190 --> 05:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
determination without uh putting at risk
 
05:51:50.750 --> 05:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
the the chance that you offend this
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
person what I would submit to you is if
 
05:51:55.250 --> 05:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
we were to make a determination on what
 
05:51:57.288 --> 05:51:57.298 align:start position:0%
the person's race was but we were then
 
05:51:59.390 --> 05:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
to not turn that over to the individual
 
05:52:01.010 --> 05:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
who had been arrested I think there
 
05:52:03.530 --> 05:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
would be some a heavy level of uncomfort
 
05:52:05.690 --> 05:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh on the part of the individual who had
 
05:52:08.090 --> 05:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
been taken into custody I think they
 
05:52:09.470 --> 05:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
would they would want to know they were
 
05:52:11.030 --> 05:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know so you will tell me everything
 
05:52:12.830 --> 05:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
about our stop you just won't tell me
 
05:52:14.750 --> 05:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
this one thought that you had while we
 
05:52:16.490 --> 05:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
were uh well you were taking me into
 
05:52:18.590 --> 05:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
custody so I think
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
um that's a perfect example of it seems
 
05:52:23.330 --> 05:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
like okay well you know what you want to
 
05:52:24.650 --> 05:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
do you want to collect the information
 
05:52:26.030 --> 05:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
but you don't want to offend somebody
 
05:52:27.530 --> 05:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
and you want to be able to analyze at a
 
05:52:28.970 --> 05:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
later date it seems like a simple
 
05:52:30.470 --> 05:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
concept but I think there are some
 
05:52:32.930 --> 05:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
complexities within it understood thank
 
05:52:32.940 --> 05:52:34.730 align:start position:0%
complexities within it understood thank
you

05:52:34.730 --> 05:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:52:38.090 --> 05:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:41.208 --> 05:52:41.218 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
05:52:44.090 --> 05:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
um on the topic of complexities and I
 
05:52:45.288 --> 05:52:45.298 align:start position:0%
don't know if this is going to sound
 
05:52:47.628 --> 05:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
like I I hope I don't
 
05:52:49.368 --> 05:52:49.378 align:start position:0%
end up phrasing this in a way that I'm
 
05:52:50.690 --> 05:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
not supposed to phrase questions because
 
05:52:52.610 --> 05:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
I don't mean it in that way
 
05:52:55.670 --> 05:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
um but is it not the case that the
 
05:52:58.970 --> 05:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
perception of all of the perceptions and
 
05:53:00.830 --> 05:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
beliefs that an officer has in a
 
05:53:02.990 --> 05:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
particular situation are relevant to
 
05:53:05.510 --> 05:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
their actions after the fact
 
05:53:07.910 --> 05:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
um and leading you know once they've
 
05:53:09.890 --> 05:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
established those perceptions isn't that
 
05:53:11.868 --> 05:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
I mean that's kind of the purpose of
 
05:53:14.030 --> 05:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
body cameras and I don't mean to be I'm
 
05:53:16.070 --> 05:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
not trying to argue I'm just introducing
 
05:53:18.110 --> 05:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
to you I guess I'm trying to form it as
 
05:53:19.548 --> 05:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
a question because I'm not supposed to
 
05:53:21.288 --> 05:53:21.298 align:start position:0%
argue with you and I'm not trying to but
 
05:53:23.090 --> 05:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
like that's the point of body cameras is
 
05:53:27.288 --> 05:53:27.298 align:start position:0%
to see the officer's perspective and so
 
05:53:30.530 --> 05:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like knowing what they
 
05:53:33.830 --> 05:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
were thinking is relevant for evaluating
 
05:53:36.110 --> 05:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
the decisions that they made but I don't
 
05:53:38.510 --> 05:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
know if you have any feedback on that
 
05:53:40.368 --> 05:53:40.378 align:start position:0%
so I I'm not sure that I understand it
 
05:53:42.948 --> 05:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to do my best and I
 
05:53:45.288 --> 05:53:45.298 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I if I'm not going
 
05:53:47.090 --> 05:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
where you think I should be
 
05:53:50.690 --> 05:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
um yes it is important to know what a
 
05:53:53.030 --> 05:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
trooper or an officer is thinking at the
 
05:53:55.310 --> 05:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
time at which they took a person into
 
05:53:55.320 --> 05:53:56.810 align:start position:0%
time at which they took a person into
custody

05:53:56.810 --> 05:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
custody
 
05:53:59.810 --> 05:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
there are certain things uh that they
 
05:54:02.470 --> 05:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
not may not be able to accurately Define
 
05:54:05.570 --> 05:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
so I I and this goes to representative
 
05:54:09.048 --> 05:54:09.058 align:start position:0%
Newell's question earlier is it then
 
05:54:11.330 --> 05:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
what what you're asking or what the the
 
05:54:13.128 --> 05:54:13.138 align:start position:0%
body is at the
 
05:54:17.090 --> 05:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
legislative body is asking uh is We
 
05:54:19.070 --> 05:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
Believe As A legislature there should be
 
05:54:21.530 --> 05:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
a mandate as to what the perception of
 
05:54:23.270 --> 05:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement officer was at the
 
05:54:25.730 --> 05:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
time uh that they had this interaction
 
05:54:27.830 --> 05:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
what the perception was of that person's
 
05:54:27.840 --> 05:54:28.610 align:start position:0%
what the perception was of that person's
race

05:54:28.610 --> 05:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
race
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
if that is in fact what the legislature
 
05:54:34.250 --> 05:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
deems is the correct path forward
 
05:54:35.690 --> 05:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
I think that's something that law
 
05:54:38.690 --> 05:54:38.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement would uh box slightly at in
 
05:54:38.700 --> 05:54:39.788 align:start position:0%
enforcement would uh box slightly at in
that

05:54:39.788 --> 05:54:39.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:54:41.930 --> 05:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
there's a high probability that you're
 
05:54:43.788 --> 05:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
going to get inaccuracies in there but
 
05:54:44.868 --> 05:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
if you're comfortable with those
 
05:54:47.330 --> 05:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies and the data when it's
 
05:54:50.930 --> 05:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
looked at later those the inaccuracy of
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
the data is is analyzed just as
 
05:54:56.330 --> 05:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
importantly as the actual numbers of uh
 
05:54:58.850 --> 05:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
the people and their their races
 
05:55:01.010 --> 05:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
then I think that that's a path forward
 
05:55:03.048 --> 05:55:03.058 align:start position:0%
that we would March down we're just
 
05:55:06.350 --> 05:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for guidance from this
 
05:55:08.510 --> 05:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislative body as to what way we move
 
05:55:13.610 --> 05:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:24.530 --> 05:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
are there not inconsistencies in the
 
05:55:27.708 --> 05:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
ex between inconsistencies between the
 
05:55:29.510 --> 05:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
experiences that officers believe they
 
05:55:31.010 --> 05:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
have the things that they believe they
 
05:55:34.330 --> 05:55:34.340 align:start position:0%
see or hear and what actually happens
 
05:55:37.070 --> 05:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
regularly in regard to other
 
05:55:39.948 --> 05:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
things aside from race for example I
 
05:55:41.990 --> 05:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
thought he had a gun it was a cell phone
 
05:55:44.150 --> 05:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
and do you still proceed with recording
 
05:55:46.850 --> 05:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
that information even knowing that there
 
05:55:49.490 --> 05:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
are histories of inaccuracies
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely uh and I think that's a
 
05:55:53.750 --> 05:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
great point to say that's a perfect
 
05:55:56.810 --> 05:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
example of something where you say I had
 
05:55:59.390 --> 05:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
a perception at the time I thought it
 
05:56:03.650 --> 05:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
was X I now know it to be y uh I would
 
05:56:05.570 --> 05:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
submit to you that if what the
 
05:56:07.430 --> 05:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
legislative what the legislature is
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
looking for is a declarative statement
 
05:56:13.310 --> 05:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
on the part of law enforcement that when
 
05:56:16.250 --> 05:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
I had interaction with this individual I
 
05:56:19.610 --> 05:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
thought them to be African-American
 
05:56:22.730 --> 05:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh then that is the guidance that we
 
05:56:24.530 --> 05:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
would need from the legislature the
 
05:56:26.330 --> 05:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
difference between the two items that
 
05:56:28.850 --> 05:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
you're talking about uh and this may not
 
05:56:32.390 --> 05:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
be like when when Joseph was uh uh
 
05:56:36.530 --> 05:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
testifying uh there I can't speak to his
 
05:56:36.540 --> 05:56:38.090 align:start position:0%
testifying uh there I can't speak to his
uh

05:56:38.090 --> 05:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:56:40.368 --> 05:56:40.378 align:start position:0%
his life experiences I can't speak to
 
05:56:43.610 --> 05:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
that but what I can say is the uh the
 
05:56:45.350 --> 05:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
difference between saying
 
05:56:48.230 --> 05:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
I thought it was a a firearm and it
 
05:56:50.150 --> 05:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
turned out to be a cell phone is
 
05:56:53.090 --> 05:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
material to the action you took I would
 
05:56:53.100 --> 05:56:54.350 align:start position:0%
material to the action you took I would
argue

05:56:54.350 --> 05:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
argue
 
05:56:56.390 --> 05:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
whether I thought you were white or
 
05:56:58.970 --> 05:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
black or anything in between is not
 
05:57:00.770 --> 05:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
material to whether or not I write you a
 
05:57:04.250 --> 05:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
summons or I take you into custody and
 
05:57:05.570 --> 05:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
that's I think the difference between
 
05:57:08.090 --> 05:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
the just those two scenarios but again
 
05:57:10.970 --> 05:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm submitting to you if if what the
 
05:57:13.190 --> 05:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
legislature is looking for is a
 
05:57:14.330 --> 05:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
declarative statement from law
 
05:57:14.340 --> 05:57:15.410 align:start position:0%
declarative statement from law
enforcement

05:57:15.410 --> 05:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:57:16.850 --> 05:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
what was your perception of this
 
05:57:18.890 --> 05:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
individual's race at the time you came
 
05:57:21.288 --> 05:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
into contact with with them then I think
 
05:57:24.470 --> 05:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's what needs to be asked for
 
05:57:26.030 --> 05:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
no no
 
05:57:26.040 --> 05:57:29.110 align:start position:0%
no no
representative

05:57:29.110 --> 05:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:32.030 --> 05:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
major I really hope that you feel like
 
05:57:33.948 --> 05:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
you are not the one on trial here
 
05:57:34.970 --> 05:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
because I feel like we've kind of
 
05:57:37.310 --> 05:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
slipped on that slope and representative
 
05:57:38.628 --> 05:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
we are going to move on representative
 
05:57:38.638 --> 05:57:40.970 align:start position:0%
we are going to move on representative
selig

05:57:40.970 --> 05:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
selig
 
05:57:43.310 --> 05:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you major for taking my
 
05:57:43.320 --> 05:57:44.448 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you major for taking my
question

05:57:44.448 --> 05:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:57:44.458 --> 05:57:45.048 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:57:45.048 --> 05:57:45.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:46.850 --> 05:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
last week we heard some testimony about
 
05:57:48.590 --> 05:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
someone else's spill about police
 
05:57:51.590 --> 05:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
education at the Academy I'm curious
 
05:57:54.590 --> 05:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
whether there's ongoing training
 
05:57:59.650 --> 05:57:59.660 align:start position:0%
for Troopers in terms of anti-bias or
 
05:58:02.750 --> 05:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
learning to recognize and own their
 
05:58:02.760 --> 05:58:04.430 align:start position:0%
learning to recognize and own their
their

05:58:04.430 --> 05:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:58:06.230 --> 05:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
own bias whether whether they know they
 
05:58:07.788 --> 05:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
are aware whether they haven't whether
 
05:58:09.170 --> 05:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
they're aware that they have their bias
 
05:58:11.570 --> 05:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
or not yeah so thank you for the
 
05:58:14.090 --> 05:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
question and yes there is ongoing uh
 
05:58:16.430 --> 05:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
training that takes place on uh bias and
 
05:58:17.690 --> 05:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
that's what that was part of the Lee act
 
05:58:19.850 --> 05:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
recommendation and that is part of our
 
05:58:22.128 --> 05:58:22.138 align:start position:0%
now uh built-in yearly training that we
 
05:58:23.930 --> 05:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh that we take part in as a division of
 
05:58:26.030 --> 05:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
State Police every every Trooper every
 
05:58:27.470 --> 05:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
member of the division of State Police
 
05:58:30.470 --> 05:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh goes through that training
 
05:58:32.270 --> 05:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:58:35.030 --> 05:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
05:58:37.310 --> 05:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all very much for
 
05:58:39.350 --> 05:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak is there
 
05:58:40.788 --> 05:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
anybody else wishing to testify on this
 
05:58:43.670 --> 05:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
bill that has not done so already
 
05:58:57.048 --> 05:58:57.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:01.490 --> 05:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:03.170 --> 05:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
it has been the custom in this committee
 
05:59:04.730 --> 05:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
to ask you to please submit your
 
05:59:06.288 --> 05:59:06.298 align:start position:0%
testimony or anything that you would
 
05:59:07.730 --> 05:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
like to rebuttal to an email to the
 
05:59:15.650 --> 05:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:26.708 --> 05:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:29.270 --> 05:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you again um committee for taking
 
05:59:31.548 --> 05:59:31.558 align:start position:0%
uh my my testimony again my name is
 
05:59:33.110 --> 05:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
Joseph Wisconsin for the record and just
 
05:59:35.090 --> 05:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to say was just that uh in
 
05:59:36.410 --> 05:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
regards to what the Department of
 
05:59:38.390 --> 05:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections had stated as the concern
 
05:59:40.430 --> 05:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
for them and how they would be gathering
 
05:59:42.948 --> 05:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
the information we do support that
 
05:59:45.590 --> 05:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
concern and do believe that possibly the
 
05:59:48.890 --> 05:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
LBA could be the solution by requiring
 
05:59:52.490 --> 05:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
them annually to to have this report
 
05:59:54.110 --> 05:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:59:55.730 --> 05:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that wishes to
 
05:59:56.810 --> 05:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
testify in this bill that is not
 
05:59:58.250 --> 05:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
submitted a pink card
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will close the public
 
06:00:03.830 --> 06:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
hearing for house bill 596.
 
06:00:05.990 --> 06:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
and that will be the end of our business
