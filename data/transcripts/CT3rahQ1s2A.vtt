discussing just exactly how the
committee

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
operates we will introduce ourselves to
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
each other both returning and new
 
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
members and we'll discuss Basic Ground
 
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
rules for conduct here in the
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
legislative office building and in
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
committee meetings as well we'll also
 
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
talk about the work we do in this
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
committee there are two major things we
 
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
do we hear bills in public hearing
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
and we pass judgment on those bills in
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
executive sessions and we will discuss
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
at length myself my vice chair and my
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
clerk we will discuss at length how we
 
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
activities so the first thing to think
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
about is and this is a question I never
 
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
thought about until I got here this
 
00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
morning and saw people struggling with
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
it what do you do with your coat when
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
you get here so there are coat racks in
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
the hallway near the elevator down here
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
near the stairway at the end of the
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
hallway and there is some limited space
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
for coats in the committee office which
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
is the uh room that's right across the
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
hall from our committee
 
00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
administrator so there is limited space
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
there for Co you could also put coats
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
back here in the corner there is a table
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
back here and a chair that's not being
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
used that's another space for coats I
 
00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
never thought about that before but it's
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
important to know where to put your coat
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
or your lunch or your briefcase or
 
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
whatever so let's get that out of the
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
mail out of the
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
way another issue I'd like to discuss
 
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
immediately is start time for these
 
00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
immediately is start time for these
committee

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:30.879 align:start position:0%
sessions generally speaking we will
 
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
attempt to start these meetings at 900
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
a.m. there will be exceptions sometimes
 
00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 align:start position:0%
we'll start at 10: but in general we'll
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
try to start these meetings at
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
9:00 I would appreciate it if all of you
 
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
could make every effort to get here
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
before 9:00 so that we have a full house
 
00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
when we launch our activity at
 
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
9:00 I understand that happens and you
 
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
can't always make it on time but please
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
make every effort that you can to get
 
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
here on
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
time it's also important to not for you
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
to know that if you know you can't
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
attend a meeting it's important that you
 
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
let your caucus leader know that you
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
can't attend the meeting so that that
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
person can let me know what your status
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
is so for Republicans the caucus leader
 
00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:30.919 align:start position:0%
is vice chair Doug Thomas and for our
 
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
Democrats the caucus leader is ranking
 
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
member cat
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
McGee I will be introducing ourselves to
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
each other in just a moment but I
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
thought it was important for you to know
 
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
that absences are certainly unavoidable
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
and acceptable but it is good practice
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
and courteous to the rest of us to let
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
as you all know we just recently had a
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
debate about it on the house floor we do
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
have in this building and in the State
 
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
House a Unwritten rule that
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
you dress appropriately when you attend
 
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
meetings in this
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
building there is no solid definition of
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
what appropriate is I realize that but
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
please be sensitive to
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
the idea that we represent the public
 
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
and the public expects us to
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
look like we
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
value our
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
role so business casual attire is
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
recommended and we'd appreciate it if
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
you could uh keep that in mind as you
 
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
morning there's other ground rules that
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
we want to I want to go over with
 
00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519 align:start position:0%
you and I think I'll keep doing that
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
until more people show up because we're
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
going to have uh introductions here
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
eventually but I'd like everybody to
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
show up if possible first um people are
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
still filing
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
in so a reminder this is a reminder not
 
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
only for members of the committee but
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
for everyone who who attending these
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
meetings food and um beverages are not
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
not and
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
if any member uh intends to bring his
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
lunch from home and eat here um
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
it's okay to bring your lunch bag into
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
the room and set it in the back
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere um but it's discouraged for
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
you to eat in this room even during

00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
clean if any member has a medical issue
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
while we're in
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
session we will contact
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
UM the house committee Services folks
 
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
immediately will probably suspend the
 
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
meeting if anybody has a serious medical
 
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
issue we will get you attended to there
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
are numerous people in this building who
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
have uh medical training EMT training
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
and they can assist us if any member is
 
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.110 align:start position:0%
and they can assist us if any member is
in

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
distress so let us know right away if
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
you're not feeling well and we will try
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
use of electronic devices we discourage
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
the use of electronic devices while
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
we're in public
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
hearings representative Thomas Doug
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
Thomas will go over that in a little
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
more detail when he talks about public
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
um hearing behavior and
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
decorum but in general we'd ask that you
 
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh refrain from using electronic devices
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
while in the committee room if you need
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
to consult email or take a phone call
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
you can always exit the room and do that
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
hallway representative McGee you have a
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
question yeah on the uh on the devices
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
in the room we had this conversation
 
00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
last orientation as well I know and uh
 
00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
our uh half of the committee actually
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
does extemporaneous note taking within
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
the meetings and within the hearings in
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
order to have um you know uh have notes
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
that let us know exactly what happened
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
and what was asked and what was answered
 
00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing so we find having
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
you know a laptop and someone on our
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
committee taking those notes uh to be
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
kind of essential to the business uh as
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
well as being able to
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
recall so yes I recall that discussion
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
from last year I think we want to try to
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
keep that to a minimum because it is
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
somewhat discouraging ious to the people
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
sitting in the table talking to us to
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
see members apparently distracted by
 
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.990 align:start position:0%
see members apparently distracted by
their

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
computers um if you must do it to record
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
your notes then I'll allow it but try to
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
keep it
 
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
as to the minimum and I'll try try to
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
make it as unobtrusive as possible if
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
you really need to take notes about what
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
you heard in a public hearing you can
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
always go back to the YouTube recording
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
these meetings are being recorded and
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
you can go back to the YouTube meeting
 
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:08.759 align:start position:0%
uh recording and watch it and take notes
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
from that so it would be it would
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
be advantageous I think to the spirit of
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
listening to our constituents if we
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
resisted as much as possible the
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
temptation to use our electronic devices
 
00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative uh who had their
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
hand up first representative Corman I
 
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
guess thank you uh so I'm one of the
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
people who took notes last time and I
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
would just like to say that in fact
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
rather than being distracted taking the
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
notes kept me Hyper focused because I
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
really had to pay attention to what was
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
going on in the questions and the
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
answers and I was actually extremely
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
attentive representative Doug Thomas
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
reiterate that I think Common Sense
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
would rule in in this case here be aware
 
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:09.759 align:start position:0%
that we are being recorded and people do
 
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
watch us live and I've seen excerpts uh
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
not so much this committee but some
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
other committees and if someone is
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
watching it through you know live
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
streaming many times we see members and
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
the Committees they're like this while
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
someone is doing a testimony or even on
 
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
on a computer they're doing it so so
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
much that it looks like half the
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
committee members aren't being attentive
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
so my point is be aware that you are
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
being looked at and your actions are
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
could be viewed by the public in certain
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
ways that you don't intend so minimize I
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
think is a good key or at least uh like
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
in representative corman's case where
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
he's he's taking notes an occasional
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
look up and you know so people know that
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
you are actually looking at the public
 
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
you know would be a something good in in
 
00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
my opinion so just be aware that that
 
00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
you are being looked at when you're in
 
00:16:05.079 --> 00:16:06.430 align:start position:0%
you are being looked at when you're in
committee

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
here I think it's true that all of us
 
00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:10.189 align:start position:0%
here I think it's true that all of us
take

00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
notes many of us use a pen and paper and
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
take written
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
notes and that I think does not offend
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
the public quite the way staring at a
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
screen does so you might want to
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
consider using pen and paper to take
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
your notes instead of an electronic
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
device Mr chairman
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGee hopefully maybe a
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
last point on this um you may recall I
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
was uh out on medical leave at the
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
beginning of the last term and I was
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
really concerned having new people
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
coming on the committee that they would
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
be able to have a central repository to
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
understand the work coming at them which
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
can sometimes be significant when you're
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
new it there's there's a lot so we
 
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
developed um we use technology basically
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
we have a Google sheet that all of our
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
work is centrally located in so you can
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
go there and look at you have links to
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
the bills you have the status of the
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
bill you have um the conversations that
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
happen in the hearings the votes
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
everything is in one place um so we are
 
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
actually leveraging technology in order
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
to make the work easier for everyone um
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
so that's the central repository where
 
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
the notes are being taken which we think
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
is more efficient than all of us having
 
00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:26.919 align:start position:0%
stuff in individual notebooks and on
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
paper so we're just using technology
 
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you speaking of a place uh
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
that you might want to store your
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
written notes uh every member will be
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
assigned a drawer in the filing cabinet
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
in the room behind us and you're welcome
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
to store in that drawer as much uh
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
material as you can get in it it's not a
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
huge drawer but each of us will have one
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
and you're welcome to use it to store
 
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
your accumulated notes and uh other
 
00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:05.559 align:start position:0%
printed resources and as you will
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
discover new members anyway will
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
discover as we go through the public
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
hearing process you will receive a lot
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
of printed material from people who are
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
testifying before the committee and
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
rather than stuff that in a bag and
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
carry it back and forth with you to your
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
house you might find it advantageous to
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
leave that material in your drawer here
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
at the State House you can take it with
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
you if you want but you may you might
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
here we will have a
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
member uh assigned to security
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
notification we have not discussed that
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
with members yet of the committee it
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
will probably be a member of the
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
Republican caucus we will discuss uh
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
that at a Caucus meeting in the near
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
future and at one of our future meetings
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
I will announce who the member assigned
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
a security notification is that member
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
will be in touch with the security
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
services in the building and if some
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
security notification needs to be issued
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
across the building then that member
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
will be the first one to get that
 
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
notification and will'll pass it along
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
to the rest of
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
us it's never happened in the 10 plus
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
years I've been here but it is possible
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
that at some
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
point there could be either a building
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
problem or
 
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.590 align:start position:0%
problem or
a

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
uh problem with the public that requires
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
us to leave the room and or the building
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
and if that happens we do have a system
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
in place and we'll talk about that at a
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
future meeting so that you'll know
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what to H what you should do um
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
if you need to leave the building there
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
are exit signs prominently displayed
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
with throughout the building
 
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799 align:start position:0%
and if for example a fire alarm were to
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
go off we should all proceed in an
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
orderly fashion to the nearest ex exit
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
and get out of the building as quickly
 
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.190 align:start position:0%
and get out of the building as quickly
as

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%

technology world the work a day world I
 
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
spent a couple of years doing some
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
freelance uh work and eventually decided
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
to run for the
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
legislature I'd actually run for the
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
state legislature way back in the
 
00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
70s in Vermont when I lived in Vermont

legislature and even though I was
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful it wetted my appetite for
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
this kind of work and this kind of
 
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%

committee ever
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
since um my family moved to New
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when I was 9 years old so I've
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
been a New Hampshire resident since I
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
was 9 years old and I maintained that
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
residency throughout my 20 some odd
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
years in the air force uh for obvious
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
reasons voting and tax purposes but I
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
have been a New Hampshire resident ever
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
to my father it was an interesting time
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh but I eventually graduated from

bigger school and a little more
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
accreditation and that allowed me to
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
have a a better chance to enter what was
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
spent I like I said I spent 19 years in
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
Salem New Hampshire I was a member of
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
the Salem Youth Soccer Association I
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
coached soccer then I became eventually
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
became the president of the Salem Youth
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
Soccer Association for several years and
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
I eventually moved up into the New
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire soccer association where I was
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
the vice chair of recreation for many
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
years and eventually became uh one of
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
the few people that have become a
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
lifetime member of the New Hampshire
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
the um uh occasionally on on the board
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh when they when they resolve some
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%

um I uh asked for Science and Tech
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
because at the time I was elected I saw
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
that energy might be a thing up and
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
coming that we need to work work on and
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
boy was that an understatement because
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
that's all we do here now in this
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%

Schools I got a great education I got a

lot of opportunities um that was a time
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
when there were many opportunities
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
coming out of the they were very
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
creative and Innovative in the Boston
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
Public Schools so um I ended up in a
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
public um College Prep program for uh
 
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:48.519 align:start position:0%
high potential students in the city of
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
Boston and I got to attend UMass Boston
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
while I was still a
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
senior and then I launched from there to
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
school over in England cuz my mom was
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
British and it just happened um so I uh
 
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
was a person who worked from a very
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
young age so I always worked and went to
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
school seemed like for a very very long
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
time I eventually earned um a master's
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
of Education with an emphasis in
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
Psychology and um I I went I went into
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
business I worked in a law firm
 
00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
initially while I was in grad school and
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
then I uh transferred over after having
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
um gotten married
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh to John Hancock Financial where I
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
spent the bulk of my career um and I I
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
moved around within the organization I
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
spent 15 years in the technology
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
training department which was where I
 
00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
started managing enterprise-wide
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
projects for the technology Workforce
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
and for the company as a whole in terms
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
of training so that was really a a
 
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
Proving Ground where I started learning
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
skills that were more applicable to the
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
21st century so I was lucky that I made
 
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
that leap um from business skills over
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
to the technology world and an
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
understanding of Technology um I uh I
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
was also divorced I had one child at the
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
time I was on my own for a while um and
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
fine uh but then I I met my current
 
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
husband 20 25 years ago and um because
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
I'm old and and uh we've been married
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
for 20 years um he had three children so
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
we have three grown children between
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
four grown children between us and nine
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and one
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
great-grandchild um when I moved up to
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
Hollis New Hampshire one of the things
 
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
that happened early on after um I took a
 
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
job at skillsoft as in the program
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
office as a program manager for software
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
engineering globally had a number of
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
International Teams there was there for
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
seven years and then my husband sold
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
this company and he invited me to no
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
longer work for the man he said if you
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
want to go do some work that you would
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
like to do um you know you can do that
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
so that is what I did um it took a
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
little while to figure out what I wanted
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
to do and um I first ran in 2012 I ran
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
in 2014 and 2016
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
unsuccessfully um and in that time there
 
00:35:22.589 --> 00:35:22.599 align:start position:0%
was a um pipeline project that was
 
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
coming through Northern Mass with a Spur
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
through that was going to bifurcate my
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
town and of course many people that had
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
received notes saying their land was
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
going to be affected were upset about
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
that and I stepped forward to try and
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
get more informed on that issue and I
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
ended up uh being asked by the town to
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
chair a task force to look at the rsas
 
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
that could potentially act as uh
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
protections for the town so that turned
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
into a wonderful project with a bunch of
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
great people um which uh towards the end
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
of us working a number of different
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
angles on trying to interact with the
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
state uh resulted in a change in the
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
plan where our Hollis was no longer part
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
of the plan they they moved up into
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire and were
 
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
affecting then 17 towns uh but skirting
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
ours and so uh I moved on to the
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
Nashville Regional planning commission's
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
energy facility advisory committee and
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
as um I don't know if Mike lot is still
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
here at the time he was with Liberty
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
that's the first time I got to know him
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
in a room but um um I I started to study
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
the regional energy landscape and my
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
connection in wanting to be on this
 
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
committee is that I understood that
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
energy is complex and the ability to
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
speak about it clearly and um also make
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
sure that we made good decisions because
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
they can be very costly decisions if we
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
don't make good decisions um that was
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
the work that I wanted to do and that's
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
the work I've been attempting to do
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
since I've been
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
here thank you representative Corman is
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
up next then representative n thank you
 
00:37:03.069 --> 00:37:03.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Tom Corman I represent
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
Grafton 15 which is Ward three of the
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
city of Lebanon uh this is my second
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
term in the house I'm serving as the
 
00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
deputy ranking member on this committee
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
I grew up in Oceanside New York went to
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
Oceanside High School got a BSE in
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
electrical engineering and computer
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
science from Princeton and then an SM
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
and PhD in the same from MIT
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
while I was at MIT I got involved in a
 
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
project of writing a textbook with two
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
MIT professors one of whom is uh
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
actually a turing Award winner which is
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
like the Nobel of computer science uh
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
this book is called introduction to
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
algorithms it's currently in its fourth
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
edition and has sold over a million
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
copies worldwide so that's been pretty
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
cool and actually a fun fact because of
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
the book I was actually once a clue on
 
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.150 align:start position:0%
the book I was actually once a clue on
Jeopardy

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh a a after escaping from MIT after
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
eight years um I got a job at Dartmouth
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
as a computer science Professor moved to
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
the Upper Valley in 1992 and Lebanon in
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
1993 with my wife
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
Nicole and uh Rose through the ranks
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
became a full Professor I was that rare
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
full Professor who actually wanted to
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
teach the introductory courses and I
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
loved teaching the introductory courses
 
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
I'm still friends with many of the
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
students who took those courses from me
 
00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:33.079 align:start position:0%
many of whom were not ultimately
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
computer science Majors but I just got
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
to be friends with them um uh I also
 
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
directed The Dartmouth College writing
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
program for the first four years of the
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
program so I have very strong views on
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
writing um I retired from Dartmouth
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
three years ago I was working with a
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
nonprofit in um White River Junction
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
called cover home repair and and there
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
was an opening uh for the house in
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
Lebanon ward 3 Senator Su Prentice
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
recruited me I ran and I won and now I'm
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
in my second term um unfortunately my
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
wife passed away in
 
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
2015 and she really uh she did a lot for
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon serving on various
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
committees and seven years on the city
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
council and she really inspired my
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
interest in doing public service so once
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
I was recruited it I decided yes this is
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
something I want to do uh with my tech
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
background I thought I'd be a natural
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
fit for this committee little did I
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
realize that this is really the energy
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
energy and energy committee so I've had
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
to learn a lot about energy which I
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
really enjoyed doing and I know I've
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
made progress because I went from I
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what I don't know to now I
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
know what I don't
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
know thank you representative next up is
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative Janine ner and after that
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
we will representative Michael
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
Harrington who is also a member of this
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
committee and a senior member of this
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
committee is not here he's actually on
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
vacation nobody should feel sorry for
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
him um but after that we'll go to I
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
think uh representative
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
parall thank you Mr chairman um my name
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
is Janine I'm from California originally
 
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
I'm the youngest of six kids and then I
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
have six kids so I've been busy very
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
busy life um got got married in 1985 and
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
we moved here in 1998 so
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
after thinking about that I guess I I'll
 
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
have to say we were five at the time
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
five years old just to do the
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
math um I first ran for office in 2010
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
when Governor sonunu the dad asked me to
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
run and I like me run like okay um I was
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
the majority whip for two terms prior to
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
that I did the same job but had a
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
different title I was Deputy Republican
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
floor leader this term I'm the assistant
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
Majority Leader it's a new job and a lot
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
more work looking forward to it though
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
keeps me very busy um I'm the task force
 
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
chair for communications and Technology
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
with the American legislators exchange
 
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
Council so we do a lot with um with
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
tech uh don't understand all of it but
 
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's okay because when you're running a
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
meeting you don't really have to know
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
you just have to know how to how to run
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
a meeting and we'll hear from you we
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
hear from you
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
which you know well um I don't really
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
like to talk too much about myself so
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
um I run 12 marathons and 13 half
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
marathons officially did a lot of
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
unofficial marathons but I don't didn't
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
get medals for those I'm a history geek
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
and I have lots of hobbies but I my
 
00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:50.119 align:start position:0%

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
Administration uh for the last 20 years
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
I've been a music teacher uh and
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
teaching in public school and being
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
around young children is
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
just probably the best thing I ever did
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
in my life um being around with people
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
that th listened and not didn't actually
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
listen to respond or to you know listen
 
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
out of curiosity all the things that I
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
truly value
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
myself um and so after upon after uh
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
retiring in 2020 I figure the best way I
 
00:43:10.349 --> 00:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
could continue my commitment to them
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
would be to serve in public office and
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
uh climate change is one of my large
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
concerns that's what brings me
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
here um I say uh I cook for
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
relaxation I play guitar U very I Styles
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
I just joined a jazz guitar Ensemble um
 
00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:33.319 align:start position:0%

that was my taster
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
verse and um I guess when it comes to
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
listening uh my uh preference would
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
probably uh be as my students used to
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
say listen to music by dead people so uh
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
uh I guess that you know classics the
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%

the

00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
choice um my choice was this committee
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%

connected with the citizens or directly

arise uh so let's get to it um so so
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
slide two uh the department of energy is
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
one of the newest State agencies um I
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
was corrected recently that we're not
 
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
the newest I've been saying that for a
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
while um but uh I think we're the newest
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner Le state agency um
 
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling house corrected me
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
on that recently so I just want to be
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
clear we're one of the newest agencies
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
and and probably the only the newest
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
agency led by a commissioner um we were
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
created in the budget in 2021 and and
 
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
what that did is it uh created the
 
01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.550 align:start position:0%
what that did is it uh created the
department

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
um as part of that the office of
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives which was the
 
01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
governor's Energy Office was dissolved
 
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
um those functions came to the new
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
Department um the Pu um still exists uh
 
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
as a much smaller entity that's focused
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
on their role as adjudicators of utility
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
rate matters and um the doe was created
 
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
in part for greater executive branch
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
input into energy policy um while
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
allowing the Pu to remain um independent
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
we have about 78 full employees um about
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
another dozen or so that are uh
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary or or part-time
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
employees so about 90 total um despite
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
our relatively small size we have a big
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
and diverse Mission as you'll see um
 
01:14:43.470 --> 01:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss some of that here in a bit
 
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
um and you can also see on slide two our
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
mission statement if that's helpful uh
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
three uh the department of agency uh
 
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
Department of energy has two two
 
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
agencies administratively attached to it
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission and the
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
office of the consumer Advocate um the
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
state's site evaluation committee is
 
01:15:07.229 --> 01:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
attached to the P to the Pu so um kind
 
01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
of like one of those Russian nesting
 
01:15:11.709 --> 01:15:11.719 align:start position:0%
dolls um so the administrative
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
attachment really only applies to back
 
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
office functions such as helping to
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking in any way um we just are
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%

Federal programs doe attorneys primarily
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
work with regulatory staff in
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%

do uh doe
 
01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
proceedings uh in in addition to the
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
above uh division specific roles we have
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to represent New
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in Regional electricity issues
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
as a representative at the New England
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
states committee on electricity the
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
department is active in discussion and
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
negotiation at the regional level uh and
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
as you'll hear later uh we have a very
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
different perspective than our neighbors
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
we're also often tasked by the
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor with
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
projects investigations and proceedings
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh we'll talk a little bit more about
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
that shortly um slide
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
four I know we said we're going to keep
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
things high level uh but we do want to
 
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
touch on just a couple of educational
 
01:20:25.229 --> 01:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
pieces that I think would be helpful a
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
lot of what we're going to discuss in
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
the next few slides will be in the
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
context of electricity which tends to be
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
the most prevalent um and has been one
 
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
of the most interest of the most
 
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
interest in the
 
01:20:38.669 --> 01:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
legislature um here's a diagram um that
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
uh ISO New England has used to give a
 
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
high Lev perspective on the electricity
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
grid again this is high level I know
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
you're hearing from ISO New England
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
maybe tomorrow um or the next day um so
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
we won't get too much into this but uh
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
as you can see we have generators uh
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
transmission infrastructure and
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
distribution infrastructure that is
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to produce and deliver
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
electricity uh to the homes of
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
consumers um slide
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
five uh this slide essentially says what
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
um goes into an electric bill uh and
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
provides a high level information on the
 
01:21:14.189 --> 01:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
types of costs that Rays have to pay uh
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
have to pay for and where those costs
 
01:21:18.270 --> 01:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
are created and
 
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
regulated distribution costs for
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
customers of New Hampshire's
 
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
investor-owned utilities are regulated
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
by the Pu
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh utilities seek to recover their costs
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
and reasonable Returns on their
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
investment through electric rates those
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
rates are reviewed by the department of
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
energy and the OCA who make
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the Pu who has to
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
determine whether the rates are just
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable and in the public
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
interest transmission costs are
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Federal Energy
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission um the department
 
01:21:49.629 --> 01:21:49.639 align:start position:0%
uh weighs in mostly through the New
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
England states committee on electricity
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh in Regional discussions um in issues
 
01:21:54.679 --> 01:21:55.790 align:start position:0%
uh in Regional discussions um in issues
before

01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
FK Supply costs are associated with the
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
purchase of electricity that consumers
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
use with the deregulation of New
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's electricity Market utilities
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
cannot profit off of supply and
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
customers have the option to use other
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
suppliers utilities provide the default
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
Service Supply um which what other
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
states call Last Resort service or basic
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
service the Pu sets the framework for
 
01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
utilities to procure default service and
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
their solicitations are reviewed by the
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
DOE and then finally there are costs
 
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
paid by rate payers that are not those
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
that are strictly necessary for the
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
provision of electric service um these
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
can be wide ranging uh from things like
 
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
Energy effic Efficiency to renewable
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
subsidies to the electric assistance
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
program public policy costs are
 
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
currently a huge topic of conversation
 
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut where they've seen high
 
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
costs associated with their nuclear
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
purchase power agreements uh offshore
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
wind and other things like a moratorium
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
on utility
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
disconnections uh next slide slide
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
this slide looks at the various costs
 
01:22:59.310 --> 01:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
you might see on your electric bill as
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
an eversource customer um it really it's
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
really just to give you a nice visual
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
representation of the various charges uh
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
and costs that customers are responsible
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
for and then moving on to slide
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
seven uh this slide looks at a
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
comparison of electric of electric rates
 
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh we're looking at eversource rates for
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
the states where eversource does
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
business um as a nice comparison um okay
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
at this point I'll turn it over to
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
Els uh thank you uh Mr chairman members
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
of the committee it's uh really great to
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
see a lot of you and nice to meet some
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
of you um I know we have uh not a lot of
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
time so I'll just go through this uh as
 
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
as quickly as I can we did select some
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
sort of pu proceedings just to kind of
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
give you a you know a view on some of
 
01:23:49.229 --> 01:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
the complex and uh you know diverse
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that our regulatory
 
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
folks have I'll admit sort of my uh my
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
goal here is just to show you know a lot
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the things we have on our plate with
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
a with a small staff and just you know
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
as a as a helpful context as you guys
 
01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
are considering legislation we hope
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
you'll consider um you know sort of what
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
goes into administering and
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
investigating a lot of those things
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
because you know frankly we're all
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
always willing to uh look into something
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
with with Direction but we do have to
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
prioritize based on the resources that
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
we have available to us so uh you know
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
here are a list of some of the high
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
important um high level important
 
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
proceedings you know rate cases tend to
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
be the really the the bread and butter
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
of what you know our regulatory division
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
are looking at that's how we're you know
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
looking at those uh you know broad-based
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
distribution rates that folks are going
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
to be be uh paying um we've also been
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
given responsibility by the governor and
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
by by the legislature uh a number of
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
Investigations proceedings and projects
 
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
um and and and I think some of you are
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
familiar and have seen uh bills related
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
to these Topics in previous legislative
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
sessions Jared did touch on many of the
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the policy and
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
programs uh division uh here are some of
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
them I just wanted you to have uh
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
something you know down it tends to be
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
the division where we hear a lot uh from
 
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
legislators oftentimes uh in a policy
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
context and and in other cases through
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
constituent inquiries or anything like
 
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
that um so here are just some of the
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
things that we're working on if that
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
helps uh look towards uh questions uh at
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
the end of this presentation
 
01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
um where I wanted to spend most of my
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
time was on Regional electric issues uh
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
because that is an area that doesn't
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
come up as much in legislation do in
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
large part to where the regulatory UH
 
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities lie but it does provide
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
important context I think to you as as
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
legislators as you're you're making uh
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know your policy decisions uh when
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
it comes to
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
electricity so as as as many of us know
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire is part of the grid
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's uh operated by ISO New England um
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
we are a small part of that grid about
 
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
10% of the of the regional load uh is
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of New Hampshire
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
because we're such a small part of that
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
load we uh have to work closely with our
 
01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
neighbors uh and a lot of that involves
 
01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:13.719 align:start position:0%
um you know uh cooperation negotiation
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
collaboration and and sometimes
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
disagreement uh and maybe sometimes as
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
an understatement um you know we do
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
share a lot of Dynamics with our
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
neighbors but those differences uh
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
really come about when you're looking at
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of the public policy decisions
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
that we have to make um all of our
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
neighbors uh in New England are are very
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
focused on decarbonization on on
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
prioritizing lower zero carbon resources
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh and their goal is to influence our
 
01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
resource mix to reflect uh their goals
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire's policy positioning
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
has been uh to prioritize costs and
 
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
reliability we don't have
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
decarbonization goals in New Hampshire
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
and uh so that leads to circumstances
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
where sometimes our goals are not
 
01:26:57.149 --> 01:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
aligned uh with the rest of the region
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature has
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
charged the department of energy uh in
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
our regional discussions with uh here uh
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
let's see the the the responsibility to
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
guard against the cost shifting of other
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
states policies to our Rays I didn't
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
have the exact statuto language down
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
here but uh you can see it in RSA
 
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
374f 8 um you know our Focus has been on
 
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
on market efficiency uh technology
 
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
neutrality reliability and affordability
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
and you'll see those goals reflected in
 
01:27:27.109 --> 01:27:27.119 align:start position:0%
the current iteration of our tene state
 
01:27:27.119 --> 01:27:29.470 align:start position:0%
the current iteration of our tene state
energy

01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
strategy uh this slide just illustrates
 
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
some of the uh clean energy goals that
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
um our our neighbors have it might be a
 
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
little out of date I think with with a
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
state or two I can't remember this
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
reflects vermonts recent changes uh but
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
if you look at these and you say well
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
well gez these must be hard goals to to
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
meet uh you're
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
right um and and I know you're going to
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
hear from ISO England I don't know
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to uh bring this up but
 
01:27:59.109 --> 01:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
they recently released a document called
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
economic planning for the clean energy
 
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
transition and this is a report that's
 
01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
designed to look at the statutory clean
 
01:28:08.109 --> 01:28:08.119 align:start position:0%
energy goals of the New England states
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
and try to Envision this system that's
 
01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:11.719 align:start position:0%
going to be necessary to meet those
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
goals by
 
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
2050 and and what they found it doesn't
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
give me a warm fuzzy feeling I don't I
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how it'll land with you uh
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
but but really what the report says that
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
is that if it's possible to meet these
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
goals it's going to be expensive it's
 
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
going to be incredibly inefficient and
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh there are going to be difficulties
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
associated with meeting our reliability
 
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh needs so to give you an example of
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
the scale of of the issue and sort of
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
the inefficiency that we're facing
 
01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
results of the modeling in the report
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
show that the New England system uh if
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue uh on a strategy
 
01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:49.719 align:start position:0%
that relies on wind solar and batteries
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh is going to need 97 gaw of total new
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
renewable capacity by 2050 to achieve
 
01:28:59.470 --> 01:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
our state goals uh that's about 18 times
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
the current combined capacity of wind
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
solar and batteries that we have on the
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
system today and we're going to have to
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
achieve that in 25 years so because of
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
seasonal and weather related variations
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
under this modeling in 2045 a new
 
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
resource would be expected to run less
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
than 10% of the year the report states
 
01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
that quote some resources needed to
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
maintain reliability during the harshest
 
01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
conditions may only run once every few
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
years the report points to a wide
 
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
variation in what's going to be needed
 
01:29:34.109 --> 01:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
for reliability between mild and uh
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
harsh uh winter conditions uh so we're
 
01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
talking about in having to build out
 
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
several gws of electricity that will
 
01:29:45.149 --> 01:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
never run in most W winter conditions or
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
will run fewer than 1% of the hours of
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
the year so there are a lot of people
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
who are working really really hard on
 
01:29:53.229 --> 01:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
these issues I don't want to be too too
 
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
dire um looking at these things but but
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
there are concerns looking forward we we
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
do spend a lot of time analyzing these
 
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
issues uh working with our neighbors um
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
but I hope it I hope you take from it
 
01:30:07.229 --> 01:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
some of the context that we're looking
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
at regionally because you know I think
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has taken a goals oriented
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh policy approach that that I think is
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh beneficial to our positioning uh
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
regionally and we hope you continue uh
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
trajectory um on the Regional
 
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:25.639 align:start position:0%
discussions it's worth touching on
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
transmission costs which represent a
 
01:30:29.109 --> 01:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
very significant part of the bill about
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
30% of wholesale Market costs uh
 
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
specifically I want to talk about a
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
class of projects called asset
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
conditioning projects um I think many of
 
01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
you folks uh may have had discussions
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
and meetings about this topic but uh
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
asset condition projects are those that
 
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
are nominally meant to replace old
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
obsolete or damaged infrastructure and
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
obviously that's an important function
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
right and maintaining our reliability is
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
is priority number one but the issue is
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
that the spending on these projects is
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
basically free of regulatory
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
oversight the spending has been
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
substantial and there are real questions
 
01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not they are necessary
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they are they have
 
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
been undertaken or plann to be
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
undertaken and so this is a tremendous
 
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
amount of money New Hampshire rays are
 
01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
going to be on the hook for about 10% of
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
the 5.4 billion dollar in spending uh
 
01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
that's uh projected to happen by 2030 uh
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that needs to be addressed
 
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's at the state Regional or
 
01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
national level and the fact that there's
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
currently no easy regulation of these
 
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
costs is a true difficulty and uh has
 
01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
the potential to be costly for New
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
bears and then I wanted to wrap up my
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion on uh winter
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
reliability issues
 
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously winter is the time
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
where we want to main maintain our
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
reliability right when the power goes
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
out and there's no way to heat your home
 
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
it it you can uh risk
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
uh significant health and economic
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
outcomes for the people in New Hampshire
 
01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
uh winter reliability issues are
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
distinct from from those in the summer
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
in the summer you're more likely to see
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
issues that are shorter in duration and
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
are related to an acute issue like a
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
generator uh going offline or or an
 
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
issue with transmission infrastructure
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
or even the forecasted load uh in Winter
 
01:32:17.229 --> 01:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
the issues are different and that's
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
where we see our gas pipeline
 
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
constraints really come into effect um
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
gas capacity gets eaten up by uh you
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
know home heating load and that
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
consequently limits the availability of
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
natural gas for electric generation and
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
so that's when you start to see
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
significant price hikes and our system
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
moves over to uh rely on oil for
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
electric generation now that's both
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
expensive and and oil is also a stored
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
fuel so if you have significant periods
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
of time where you're uh relying on oil
 
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
using up that stored fuel uh you you
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
risk situations where if resupply is is
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
difficult or impossible and and uh you
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
know we're running short on capacity we
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
will see short uh shortfalls in capacity
 
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
and that's both expensive and likely to
 
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
lead to longer term sustained uh
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
problems uh which which could be weeks
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
long um now our current resource mix
 
01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
looks ready to meet the needs through
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
2032 it depends really on on which
 
01:33:14.669 --> 01:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
projections you're looking at but the
 
01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
region uh does need to find long-term
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
solutions that balance supply and demand
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
and encourage investment that improve uh
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
winter performance so uh Mr chairman you
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
did ask us to talk about the renewable
 
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards so I'm going to
 
01:33:30.109 --> 01:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
invite our uh policy and programs
 
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
director Josh Elliott to come up and uh
 
01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
discuss the RPS and then we can get to
 
01:33:35.239 --> 01:33:37.030 align:start position:0%
discuss the RPS and then we can get to
questions

01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
well I was thinking that in order to
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
avoid the problem of musical chairs
 
01:33:46.629 --> 01:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
maybe we should uh ask a few questions
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
of you gentlemen first before we move to
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
the RPS discussion would that be
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
agreeable to you and does the committee
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
think that's a good idea
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
that that's fine with us I think we
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
reserve the right to to call and pinch
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
hitters if we're diving deep into a
 
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
specific topic where we have somebody
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
who might be able to provide you the the
 
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
best answer understood just trying to
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
keep U chair exchanges to a minimum uh
 
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
questions for these two gentlemen
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
gentlemen uh for coming to give us your
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
report this morning uh you mentioned
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has a goal oriented
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
approach u in difference with our
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
neighboring states so I wanted to hear
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
more about your the you know New
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's goal oriented approach and
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
how that relates to uh the scenario that
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
you envision in order to meet our
 
01:34:39.109 --> 01:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
long-term demand as opposed to the the
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
clean energy transition that is outlined
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the iso report sure that's a great
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
question and I think it really ties into
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
a technology neutral approach or you
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
know what some folks will will call an
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
all of the above uh energy approach and
 
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
and what we argued and what the state
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
energy strategy States is that when
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
you're looking at an energy policy
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
especially when it relates to a resource
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh or what the resource mix should be
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't look at at trying to
 
01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
promote a resource for the sake of
 
01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
promoting that resource we should
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
identify the goals whe whether they're
 
01:35:13.229 --> 01:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
uh price whether they're reliability
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
whether they're uh you know clean energy
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
related and build that structure so that
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to achieve is that
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
outcome rather than saying we want to
 
01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
promote we want more natural gas we want
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
more solar we want nuclear whatever it
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
is and and to identify what do we want
 
01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
our our results to be and then build a
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
system where uh you know a market uh
 
01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
where where competition can help to find
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
the most efficient resource at meeting
 
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
those needs uh you know when we pick
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
winners and
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
losers I think it's fair to say more
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
often than not government does not find
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
the optimal solution and so by building
 
01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:53.239 align:start position:0%
a structure where you are focused on the
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
goal you want to achieve provided that
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
the goal is not we want this resource
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
for its own sake um or we're not going
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
to uh disregard a resource simply by
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
virtue of being that resource uh you're
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
going to find more optimal more
 
01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
efficient outcomes so it doesn't say
 
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
don't do clean energy goals don't try to
 
01:36:15.149 --> 01:36:15.159 align:start position:0%
find a reliable resource it means it
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
means identify what you want and then
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
let let the market deliver what's
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
best any additional questions uh
 
01:36:23.679 --> 01:36:25.070 align:start position:0%
best any additional questions uh
representative

01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
Summers thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I actually
 
01:36:30.669 --> 01:36:30.679 align:start position:0%
have a a two-part question if I can to
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
jam it in the first one is probably
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
going to be a short a very quick answer
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
but uh the first one being that uh we
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
know about uh last term term before we
 
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
brought up a lading prices we know that
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
the Pu has had an open docket about
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
looking into laddering electrical rates
 
01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
from the supply side and where we know
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire co-op uh has a lading is
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
docket still remain open with the Pu and
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
does the department of energy have
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
standing in this rate and lading that's
 
01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
the first part sorry about that and the
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
second one I have for you is while you
 
01:37:07.149 --> 01:37:07.159 align:start position:0%
represent while you state that the New
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has 10% of the load and Mystic
 
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
um with Mystic closing in Massachusetts
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
how much of the what percentage of the
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
power does New Hampshire itself generate
 
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
of the iso New England
 
01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:23.719 align:start position:0%
states those are great questions uh I
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
will start with the first one so the Pu
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
does have a uh well in the pu's
 
01:37:30.109 --> 01:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
proceedings related to the procurement
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
of default service electricity so that's
 
01:37:35.709 --> 01:37:35.719 align:start position:0%
that you know last resort electricity uh
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
they have been
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
undertaking um a a a more market-based
 
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
approach towards procuring that
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
electricity so for a long time New
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's policy has been for the
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
utilities who who don't make a profit
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
under Supply at all
 
01:37:57.950 --> 01:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
um they they built a framework uh for uh
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
self or excuse me for for uh energy
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
Supply that involves competitive bidding
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
from competitive uh electricity
 
01:38:06.159 --> 01:38:08.149 align:start position:0%
from competitive uh electricity
suppliers

01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
suppliers
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
um after looking at data that suggests
 
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
that there's significant risk premiums
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
associated with those bids and that
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
there there might be opportunities to
 
01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
save right payers money by uh exposing
 
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
them to to directly to the market
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
um they they've uh endeavored
 
01:38:34.669 --> 01:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
to add an increasing amount of that
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
supply of market-based supply to the mix
 
01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh we're still relatively early in that
 
01:38:42.589 --> 01:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
process but those tranches of
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
electricity that have been procured um
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
that have that market exposure have seen
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
we've seen significantly lower rates uh
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
associated with that obviously there's a
 
01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
lot that that that goes into um you know
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh moving more towards utility
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
self-supply in relationship to you know
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
what the utilities have to have on hand
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
to be able to meet whatever needs that
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
come in uh risks for uh Major Market
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
changes but I I would say we are
 
01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
encouraged by the pricing that we've
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
seen there which has seen substantial
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
savings over what um has has
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
historically been been seen for uh
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply bits um so you know I
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
think lading is is is an approach that
 
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
really the the conversation around
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
lading which involves uh layering those
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
procurements over um from from several
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
periods of the year and and blending
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
that together to bring in more price
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
stability that conversation really
 
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
started to get uh going and gain a lot
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
more traction when we saw electricity
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
prices spike in 2022 mostly in relation
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
to the Russian invasion of Ukraine um
 
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:54.679 align:start position:0%
you know what we saw through that
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
process New Hampshire did not do lading
 
01:39:59.310 --> 01:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
right and and our neighbors did we saw
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire saw price spikes
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
early uh we also saw price reductions
 
01:40:06.189 --> 01:40:06.199 align:start position:0%
much much faster than our our neighbors
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
did and when you look at the overall
 
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
costs New Hampshire Rays paid
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
significantly less than than our
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
neighbors who did uh you know pursue
 
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
lading um you know if you look at
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
something I had this data at one point
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't really know it off the
 
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
top of my head but it was it was at
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
three years looking back and if you
 
01:40:27.149 --> 01:40:27.159 align:start position:0%
looked at um what we what our default
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
service right payers were paying for
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
default service it was something like we
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
paid higher uh than the rest of the
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
region in like five of the 36 months and
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the rest we we saw savings so I right
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
now I think the lattering conversation
 
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
has been um put on hold a little bit as
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
we've seen more sustain you know that
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
return to normal following the invasion
 
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously it's a it's a
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
topic of conversation and that if that's
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
where folks want to go you know that's
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
going to be something we all have to
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
look at uh the conversation really has
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
moved more towards looking at that
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
market-based uh utility
 
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
self-supply um when it comes to you know
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh how we want to change our default
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
service procurement and I'm sorry I I
 
01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
just talked myself out of remembering
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
what your second question was that sorry
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
about that um and second part was the uh
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
with the closing of Mystic down in
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts while you said stated that
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire provides it it has 10
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
takes 10% of the load of electrical rate
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
what percentage of uh generation is
 
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
created in the state of New
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I believe it's somewhere
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
between 15 and and 20% um but I'll look
 
01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:35.229 align:start position:0%
between 15 and and 20% um but I'll look
to

01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
177% thank
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
you okay additional questions
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you both for coming
 
01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
here um when when Deputy Commissioner
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
Elms spoke of the asset condition
 
01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
problem uh I I naively would think that
 
01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:55.719 align:start position:0%
that this is actually a good thing
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
because uh maintaining the existing
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
lines is important for reliability yet I
 
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
got this undertone from you that there's
 
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
there's an issue here and I'd like to
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
hear more about that please sure and and
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
I don't Dan if you want to jump in feel
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
free to to come up here um you know
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
maintaining reliability as I said that's
 
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
priority number one and maintaining
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
those lines is is very important and I
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
know a lot of that conversation has been
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the context of the North Country I'll
 
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
tell you know I wouldn't call myself a
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
North Country guy but a White Mountains
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
guy certainly and and you know we saw
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
eversource heading up to Sugar Hill um
 
01:42:33.589 --> 01:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
to to deal with some issues on this line
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh recently I'll you know that's where
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
my my father lives and you know spent a
 
01:42:40.109 --> 01:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
lot of time there so I am certainly not
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh unsympathetic to the needs of of of
 
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
our folks to the north um the question
 
01:42:47.709 --> 01:42:47.719 align:start position:0%
is whether or not the spending that
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing to maintain that reliability
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
is is all focused on on maintaining that
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
right we want to maintain reliability
 
01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:57.639 align:start position:0%
but the question is you know are we are
 
01:42:59.550 --> 01:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
we spending the right dollars and are we
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
spending too much on on what's needed
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
there um I I don't want to tell you that
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
the answer is necessarily yes or no I'd
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
say we have some real concerns about uh
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
what those numbers are and it's been
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
difficult to find out what we we um you
 
01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
know need need to know on on a a variety
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
of projects that are not limited to New
 
01:43:20.669 --> 01:43:20.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so this is this is not uh a
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
specific project uh issue um I think
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of attention related to
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
to one that's that's in New Hampshire
 
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
but uh it's a concern we have going into
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
the next 5 10 years because we've really
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
seen that a lot of the reliability
 
01:43:39.589 --> 01:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
spending of the of the first half of of
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
or or the last decade was focused on
 
01:43:44.669 --> 01:43:44.679 align:start position:0%
building out that infrastructure and now
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
basically we've we've built what we are
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to build and and so when we're
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
seeing the increasing spending happening
 
01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
on maintaining those lines we think it's
 
01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
important that we have regulatory
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
oversight that's the whole that's the
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
whole thing we're doing here uh building
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
out that infrastructure has significant
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input on the regional level
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
it has significant uh regulatory
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
oversight on that Regional level but
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
this class of maintaining at you know
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
these asset condition projects uh does
 
01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
fall into this sweet spot where there
 
01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
really is not uh a level of oversight
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
that that we would feel comfortable
 
01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
having uh when it comes to utility
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
regulation uh Dan I don't know if you
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
want to add to that Dan failen I sorry I
 
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
keep going back to is our regional
 
01:44:30.990 --> 01:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
policy director and he's a uh he's our
 
01:44:32.589 --> 01:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
uh co- Nesco manager alongside
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner sha coin Nesco being the
 
01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
New England states committee on
 
01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
electricity and that's the group of the
 
01:44:38.910 --> 01:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
states uh coming together to have these
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
negotiations so uh hope that answered
 
01:44:44.669 --> 01:44:44.679 align:start position:0%
your question representative Wendy
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um this is in
 
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
regard to slide 15 which is winter
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
reliability um we know that that our
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
Winters are getting warmer have you
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
factored in temperature change um
 
01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:58.910 align:start position:0%
factored in temperature change um
through

01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:45:02.189 --> 01:45:02.199 align:start position:0%
2032 uh for your projections and if so
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
what resources did you use sure and and
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh Dan feel free to come up if you know
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
more about this but this is um you know
 
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of the analysis that's that's out
 
01:45:13.870 --> 01:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
there is from you know ISO New England
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
and other resources like that so a lot
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
of that uh analysis um was not done by
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
Doe specifically I I do think that it uh
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
accounts for a variety of weather
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thanks for the question
 
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
so uh the the data reference there was
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
an ISO study that looked out to 2032 it
 
01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
used the most extreme winter scenarios
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that it was the winter of
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
62 uh that was the the worst winter that
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
they found over looking out over the
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
recent history um and and it found
 
01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.189 align:start position:0%
recent history um and and it found
adequate

01:45:56.189 --> 01:45:56.199 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
01:45:59.950 --> 01:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh adequate resources uh as far as we
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
can tell for her now with the current
 
01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
resource mix and the current anticipated
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
retirements and new resources um
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
obviously if things don't go according
 
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
to schedule over the next five years
 
01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
then uh the the situation gets different
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
but right now it it looks in good shape
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative follow Mr
 
01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
chair oh you need a followup okay yes
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
please um Dan don't go anywhere um so
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
conversely we know that our summers are
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
getting hotter and we're using a lot of
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
energy in the Summers so is there any
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
concern about summer reliability so
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
there is it's uh currently we are a
 
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
summer peaking system the anticipation
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
is that we will move to a winter peaking
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
system which means the the winter issues
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
will be uh will require more Supply in
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
the winter than during the summer um and
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
Chris spoke about sort of the
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
differences between the summer and the
 
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
winter they're kind of different problem
 
01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're a weekl long winter cold
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
snap but that we're in the middle of
 
01:46:59.790 --> 01:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
right now the problem is having enough
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
fuel for the entire period as opposed to
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
meaning that
 
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
acute Peak period in the summer um
 
01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
they're just different kinds of problems
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
and they require different kinds of
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
Solutions Representative Doug
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um we all know
 
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
that that we have some short-term
 
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
challenges coming up particularly in
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
terms of um pricing in the power grid
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
and everything but on a longer term
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
basis and more to the fact that you know
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
people are now beginning to talk about
 
01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
smallscale nuclear particularly ISO uh
 
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
ISO New England is talking about it um
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
EU has talked about it uh a lot of the
 
01:47:39.149 --> 01:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
states are beginning to you know look
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
into it um we see a real uh potential
 
01:47:45.589 --> 01:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
here for New Hampshire to take advantage
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
of the of this new technology what is
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
your department doing to both facil
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
facilitate uh and interest investors
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps into coming into the state and
 
01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
also in terms of getting the word out
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
that this really is a good thing in the
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
not too distant future but still a few
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
years down line we have to attack the
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
cost issue of it and also the perception
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
as well so what's the what's the O's uh
 
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
um status of of this up you know this
 
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
indication you know yeah it's a it's a
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
great question and it's one that um in
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
the I I mentioned before Oh the uh is
 
01:48:28.589 --> 01:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
New England epet report they actually do
 
01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about um Alternatives
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
that can help reduce uh some of the
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
buildout that would be necessary to meet
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
clean energy goals and one of the the uh
 
01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:39.719 align:start position:0%
scenarios that they looked at was the
 
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
addition of um you know more small
 
01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
modular nuclear reactors and advanced
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactors uh to help offset that
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
and what they found is that uh the
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
buildout uh if that buildout included a
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the load um being
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
represented by nuclear power that it
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
would significantly reduce the
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
inefficiency that we talked about um
 
01:49:01.589 --> 01:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
because it's obviously a scalable uh
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
clean energy resource um you know there
 
01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
are challenges associated with nuclear
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
power specifically just at the
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
development of the technology where it
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
is today uh and and and today's costs um
 
01:49:16.109 --> 01:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
which are High um you know as to what
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
doe is doing uh the legislature uh last
 
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
year in their wisdom uh added to our our
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities within our office of
 
01:49:26.669 --> 01:49:26.679 align:start position:0%
offshore wind industry development
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for energy Innovation
 
01:49:32.669 --> 01:49:32.679 align:start position:0%
um and that uh included a significant um
 
01:49:35.229 --> 01:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
review that the department is is and
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
will be undertaking of you know what
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
are what are our states uh you know you
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
know hurdles obstacles roadblocks to uh
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
the development of nuclear power uh
 
01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
we're one of a few states that in New
 
01:49:50.430 --> 01:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
England that does not have a ban on
 
01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
nuclear power coming in uh new nuclear
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
power coming in um so as part of that
 
01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill you did also give us the
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh hire staff to be a uh
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
a essentially a nuclear coordinator um
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
somebody will know the the right title
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
there uh but and that position is posted
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh on our on our jobs portal so we or if
 
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
it's not now it it will be reposted uh
 
01:50:16.589 --> 01:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
obviously attracting nuclear experts to
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
state government service is a difficulty
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
because if you're an expert on nuclear
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
power you can make a lot of money in the
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
private sector uh but we are doing what
 
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
we can to facilitate um you know uh a
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure that allows
 
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
resources you know to come
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
in representative Bernardi has a
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh looking
 
01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
at your ISO New England epet report
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
there how realistic do you believe those
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
projected build outs of wind and solar
 
01:50:58.589 --> 01:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
are what are the costs anticipated for
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire citizens in their rates
 
01:51:05.069 --> 01:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
what kind of increase would you see and
 
01:51:07.950 --> 01:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh assuming that this does not
 
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
materialize um what kind of backup is
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
needed for truly reliable
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
power sure it's a good question and um
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
Dan can come tap me on the shoulder I
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe the epet report itself
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
looked at the specific cost projection
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
associated with this buildout I think
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
there was a recent report from the jiah
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
Bartlet Center that that looked at a I
 
01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
think a more significant buildout than
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
what was projected under epet and I
 
01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
think that projection was something like
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
doubling the cost of
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
electricity uh you know for folks um in
 
01:51:40.830 --> 01:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
terms of the realistic you know whether
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
or not it's realistic um you know we've
 
01:51:45.790 --> 01:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
seen real difficulties in sighting
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in in New Hampshire and
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
and I think there's a lot of
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh there's obviously a lot of
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
problems trying to get get things done
 
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
just from a sighting perspective before
 
01:51:59.310 --> 01:51:59.320 align:start position:0%
you even start to think about costs now
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at costs things like
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
offshore wind um have been a resource
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
that's looked at as a as a scalable
 
01:52:07.629 --> 01:52:07.639 align:start position:0%
clean resource um that that might be
 
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
necessary to actually maintain
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
reliability needs uh if you're going to
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
have um uh you know meet the clean
 
01:52:16.109 --> 01:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
energy goals offshore wind's very
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
expensive the last solicitation I saw
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
and I might be behind the times here but
 
01:52:22.109 --> 01:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
it was about $150 megawatt hour uh in
 
01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
New York
 
01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
and that's you know what four or five
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
times as expensive as the market market
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
price U maybe maybe yeah three or four
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
um we have this solicitation um
 
01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Connecticut Rhode Island
 
01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to do a joint procurement of
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
offshore wind we saw Connecticut did not
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
join what those results were I don't
 
01:52:43.149 --> 01:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
know if we've seen the results of that
 
01:52:43.159 --> 01:52:45.830 align:start position:0%
know if we've seen the results of that
solicitation

01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
solicitation
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
Dan okay so we Haven we haven't seen
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
what the actual cost projections are uh
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
yet but um
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
we know that Connecticut said this was
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
too too rich for our blood and they
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
backed out of it so uh there
 
01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
are real kind of concerns associated
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
with you know this epet report does also
 
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
assume that we're going to build out
 
01:53:07.629 --> 01:53:07.639 align:start position:0%
some of the offshore wind that's been
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
planned we've seen real difficulties and
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
delays in building out that offshore
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
wind so the more and more that happens
 
01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
the more and more those reliability
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
projections become less Rosy and they're
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
already not that great to begin with and
 
01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
then uh you know the costs are only
 
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
going to go up uh
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that answers your
 
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
question but uh it's it's not it's not a
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
um it's not a problem that that won't
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
have uh complexities a lot of hard work
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
and uh maybe some hopes and prayers
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
them representative McGee has a question
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
01:53:51.390 --> 01:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
being here this morning with us again um
 
01:53:54.750 --> 01:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
yeah my question also is around uh the
 
01:53:57.149 --> 01:53:57.159 align:start position:0%
costs of these future projections that
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about um I'm wondering
 
01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
whether doe is um engaged at all in
 
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
trying to determine sort of least cost
 
01:54:08.430 --> 01:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes you because if
 
01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
if the way I look at New Hampshire
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
energy policy is that we want to be
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
setting a
 
01:54:15.790 --> 01:54:15.800 align:start position:0%
trajectory and when I first started
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
paying attention to the energy policy in
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
the state that was exactly what the
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
10-year strategy report did it set a
 
01:54:24.990 --> 01:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
trajectory it talked based on um
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
individual sectors of the energy economy
 
01:54:29.069 --> 01:54:29.079 align:start position:0%
as to what the plans were for both
 
01:54:31.069 --> 01:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
lowering emissions and addressing the
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
climate concerns the pollution concerns
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
and also managing for the lowest cost
 
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
but one of the things I think you're
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
alluding to with the conversation that
 
01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:45.639 align:start position:0%
just went by is that as we're going on
 
01:54:47.790 --> 01:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
the answers the solutions to our
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
problems whether it's reliability you
 
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
know getting the energy into the state
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
the costs of those are going up and the
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire can be proud that
 
01:54:59.790 --> 01:54:59.800 align:start position:0%
we're not in the same boat as all the
 
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
folks around us but we also don't have a
 
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
plan in terms of the trajectory and I'm
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
concerned that without a plan for how
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to get there that we can
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
actually point to and work on that we
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
will end up paying the most not the
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
least so that I'll just leave it there
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
no and I appreciate that and you know
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
we've had some conversations
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative on on this topic over the
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
years I think you know you alluded to
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know making sure we can meet those
 
01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
climate goals and and lower emissions
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
you know if you folks are interested in
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
passing that bill and and the governor
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
signs it into law we're happy to you
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
know include that in terms of in our
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
decision-making the legislature has
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
repeatedly over the years rejected uh
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
decarbonization goals as a goal and have
 
01:55:49.069 --> 01:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
strengthened our responsibility to argue
 
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
against the cost shifting of policies so
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know as as an executive branch
 
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
agency we're trying to implement the law
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
as the legislature has passed it and and
 
01:55:59.950 --> 01:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
what the legislature has done is say no
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
we want to focus uh not on
 
01:56:04.030 --> 01:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
decarbonization but on cost and
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
affordability and we want you to argue
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
against Shifting the cost of those
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
policies you know to New Hampshire um
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know looking forward I it is a
 
01:56:15.629 --> 01:56:15.639 align:start position:0%
difficult problem right and we
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
are well I don't want to say it's
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
inextricable because you know we are
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
tied to our neighbors for now and you
 
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
know I know that there's conversation
 
01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
and I know that there's legislation
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
pending that would look at what is New
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's proper role in The Grid in
 
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
ISO New England do we want to look at
 
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
Alternatives do we want to look at
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
alternative regulatory structures that
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
may might not involve us leaving but
 
01:56:41.149 --> 01:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
saying how can we further uh insulate
 
01:56:43.069 --> 01:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
ourselves you know in accordance with
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
our our you know uh statutory mandate to
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh protect against cost shifting you
 
01:56:50.350 --> 01:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
know you look at a state like Vermont
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
that's not vertically integrated and
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
they don't have a significant share of
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
their load tied up in the iso New
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
England markets maybe that's something
 
01:56:58.030 --> 01:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
that that New Hampshire is going to look
 
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
at I think um should the should the
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
legislature move forward with a bill
 
01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
having us look into that um you know
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
that we're going to explore every Avenue
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
to to do precisely what what sounds like
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
you're asking for us to do because uh
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
the the regional context is it's it's a
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
difficult one right you know if we're
 
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
only 10% of the load we we don't have um
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to just say this is what New
 
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wants
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh get it done we do a pretty good job
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know and and we've done uh we've
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
been pretty successful in working with
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
our neighbors to um tailor policies to
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
to uh you know kind of both account for
 
01:57:37.870 --> 01:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
our neighbors needs while while looking
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
out for New Hampshire's interest I you
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
know um at some point it's a topic he
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
could go on for several hours about but
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk more about um uh
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
phase two of I New England's uh
 
01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:49.639 align:start position:0%
transmission planning that's something
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
where we worked with our neighbors to
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
say you know what are your needs what is
 
01:57:56.189 --> 01:57:56.199 align:start position:0%
that Baseline sort of resource need that
 
01:57:58.510 --> 01:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on and and say okay New
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we agree to pay for those
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
things that are you know beneficial to
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
us under our formula anything over the
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
top of that if if it doesn't work out
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
right those are going to be costs that
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
other states have to go on I'm and I'm
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
going way out over my skis because you
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
know uh he's he's the guy negotiating
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
those types of things but there really
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
is a lot of work that we we do um you
 
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
know and we have a we have a good
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
relationship with our neighbors again
 
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes we just know we can't agree
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
with them but uh we do we don't see
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
ourselves as being free of the the the
 
01:58:32.709 --> 01:58:32.719 align:start position:0%
regional context uh we have to make
 
01:58:35.790 --> 01:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
do okay representative uh representative
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
SW Swanson has a question and then I
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
think we after that we need to move on
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
RPS I just to springboard on uh the plan
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
issue that was mentioned and I was going
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
to describe more about my investment in
 
01:58:56.069 --> 01:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
solar panels and whole house and the
 
01:58:58.589 --> 01:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
fact that uh I got my first
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
net uh charge from eversource this past
 
01:59:05.589 --> 01:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
month for the past eight months I have
 
01:59:07.470 --> 01:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
been providing through the benefit of
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
net metering back into the Grid
 
01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
electricity and there's a long ways to
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
go but I believe in investing in the
 
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
future and it can be
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
expensive uh it'll probably take a long
 
01:59:23.550 --> 01:59:23.560 align:start position:0%
time hopefully I'll live long enough to
 
01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
see a return on investment but
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
investment is important and I recognize
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
that there is legislation in
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
place uh from the past based upon
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
previous concerns and certainly
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
expensive is a term I've heard several
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
times and we don't want to make things
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
too expensive but sometimes it is
 
01:59:47.229 --> 01:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
worthwhile investing because what I'm
 
01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
missing from these graphs is well what
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
is the stability
 
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
of and it sounds like a plan the basic
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
plan is to continue relying heavily on
 
01:59:57.679 --> 01:59:58.669 align:start position:0%
plan is to continue relying heavily on
fossil

01:59:58.669 --> 01:59:58.679 align:start position:0%
fossil
 
02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
fuels uh oil gas whatever and uh uh it's
 
02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
not clear for me that there's 100%
 
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
transmission to Renewables in this but I
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a cost analys analysis or a
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
guarantee of the Avail availability of
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels over the next 25 years so
 
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh but that not not
 
02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
withstanding uh it's noted here that uh
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
we'll need 18 times the current combined
 
02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
capacity within the next 25 years now I
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
jumped on solar with my house because I
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
felt the technology was ready and we
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
have new technologies becoming available
 
02:00:42.030 --> 02:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
all the time and I'm not going to you
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
know I just want to move off of that
 
02:00:47.790 --> 02:00:47.800 align:start position:0%
dependence what my question is is this
 
02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:49.719 align:start position:0%
this was a 25e
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
goal and uh what I'm
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
the feeling I'm getting is let's stick
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
with the the the mix we currently have
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
and just try to make sure every megawatt
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
or kilowatt or watt is as cheap as
 
02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
possible right now based upon current
 
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
capacity and capability and
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
Technology I'm not hearing much about
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
investment or rather I hear resistance
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
to investment in the future and the uh I
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
have a two-part question is your plan
 
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
for the next 25 years recommend ing a
 
02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
continued mix of dependence on fossil
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
fuels at the current
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
percentage through that 25 years or is
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
there a longer term plan to or any plan
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
to move into Renewables and off of
 
02:01:42.069 --> 02:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
dependent from fossil fuels which will
 
02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
probably get more expensive as they
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
become more scarce because we all know
 
02:01:50.669 --> 02:01:50.679 align:start position:0%
that fossil fuels are a finite resource
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you sure thank you for the
 
02:01:55.950 --> 02:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
question um yeah so so there is no
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
current plan to transition us entirely
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
off fossil fuels and that's based on us
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
um you know helping to implement the
 
02:02:03.709 --> 02:02:03.719 align:start position:0%
statutory obligations that the
 
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
legislature has passed if the
 
02:02:07.229 --> 02:02:07.239 align:start position:0%
legislature wants us to pursue a
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
strategy that involves a 100% transition
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
away from fossil fuels um they're
 
02:02:15.310 --> 02:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
perfectly at Liberty to do so and if the
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill passed and was signed into law we
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
would be uh happy to and statutory
 
02:02:23.709 --> 02:02:23.719 align:start position:0%
obligated to uh Implement that uh it's
 
02:02:26.830 --> 02:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
not currently the case um you know when
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
it comes to uh trying to pick the right
 
02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
percentage of our resource mix falling
 
02:02:34.030 --> 02:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
to fossil fuels that's also something
 
02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:35.679 align:start position:0%
we're not doing what we're trying to do
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
is say we want to we want to maintain
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
our reliability we want to prioritize
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
low cost and we want to build a system
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
and and you know uh ISO New England uh
 
02:02:47.709 --> 02:02:47.719 align:start position:0%
they manage the wholesale markets uh
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
where a lot of the power you know uh for
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
New England is procured and and that is
 
02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
designed that market is designed not to
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily deliver uh clean energy it's
 
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
designed to deliver reliable lowcost
 
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
electricity um so yeah I wouldn't say
 
02:03:07.069 --> 02:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
that we have a goal of fossil fuels at
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
this percentage Renewables you know at
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
this percentage outside of the renewable
 
02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard which we're going to
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
hear uh about uh very soon um you know
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
our our goal has been to find the most
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
efficient resources to meet our needs um
 
02:03:22.910 --> 02:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
you know when the conversation about net
 
02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
metering just to briefly talk about that
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
um you know our goal is not to you know
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
through net metering net metering is not
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
designed to be subsidy it's designed to
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
be fair compensation for um you know
 
02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
what's the the power that's being put
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
onto the grid uh for the power that's
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
avoided um so you know in an Ideal World
 
02:03:45.189 --> 02:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
right the net metering rate is not a um
 
02:03:47.229 --> 02:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
a subsidy rate it's a it's a it's fair
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
compensation so um you know our we don't
 
02:03:52.350 --> 02:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
have a state goal of delivering
 
02:03:55.830 --> 02:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
X number of gws of solar power uh on any
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
particular time frame it's develop the
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
fair rate that compensates uh for the
 
02:04:03.229 --> 02:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
benefits that that whatever the
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
distributed generation resource uh is
 
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
that you're net metering um that's
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
that's what the goal is well I want to
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr commissioner and Mr Deputy
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioner for this uh excellent
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
overview of the Department's roles and
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in the executive branch
 
02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
and and I'd like now for uh you to
 
02:04:28.109 --> 02:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
transition to a examination of the
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard happy to do
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
so and I'm gonna stay up here we're
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
going to invite uh director Josh Elliott
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:42.270 --> 02:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
RPS welcome Mr Elliot good to see you
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
again morning Mr chairman uh members of
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
the committee good to see you as well um
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
good to meet the new members as well uh
 
02:04:50.669 --> 02:04:50.679 align:start position:0%
for the record Josh Elliott I serve as
 
02:04:52.270 --> 02:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
the Director of the division of policy
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
and programs uh with the New Hampshire
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um representative
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
rolds who I realize is on the way out
 
02:04:58.990 --> 02:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
the door I was born and raised in
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
Westfield massachusett so right next
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
door to a
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
Springfield glad I caught you before you
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
walked out anyway um so I am talking
 
02:05:08.830 --> 02:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
today uh at the request of the uh chair
 
02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
to do a little bit of a deeper dive into
 
02:05:13.229 --> 02:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard um so
 
02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
as I walk through these just a uh one
 
02:05:18.549 --> 02:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
caveat uh to talk about some exceptions
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh up front this is a broad brush stroke
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
um they're always going to be little
 
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
nuances little exceptions to certain
 
02:05:25.870 --> 02:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
things that I say I did not dive into
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
all the minutia of the details but just
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to give sort of a broad picture
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
of what this looks like accurately but
 
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
there might be little things here and
 
02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
there like oh well except for etc etc
 
02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
and I didn't want to clog up my slides
 
02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
with all those
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
exceptions so this is the renewable
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard or the RPS is set in
 
02:05:47.470 --> 02:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
statute and it's in RSA 363 F uh where
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
providers of electricity are required to
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
obtain and then retire a certain number
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
of uh renewable energy certificates or
 
02:05:56.549 --> 02:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
Recs uh to cover their sales for the
 
02:05:58.189 --> 02:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
prior year now that's a very loaded
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
sentence so I'm going to sort of break
 
02:06:01.629 --> 02:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
that out a lot a little bit so providers
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
of electricity who are these people
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
these are any entities that sell
 
02:06:07.549 --> 02:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
electricity uh in the state of New
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that includes the regulated
 
02:06:11.950 --> 02:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
utilities that includes competitive
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
suppliers it includes um other
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
aggregation plans such as Community
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
power um Freedom Logistics there's a
 
02:06:20.189 --> 02:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
couple of them that are operating uh in
 
02:06:22.189 --> 02:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
that space
 
02:06:24.549 --> 02:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
so they are required to cover a certain
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
percentage and we're going to get to
 
02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
those percentages and how they do that
 
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
of their sales with what are called
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates or wrecks
 
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
so what the heck is a wreck so a wreck
 
02:06:37.629 --> 02:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
is is a representation of the renewable
 
02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
attributes of
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
electricity so um I know the Deputy
 
02:06:43.229 --> 02:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioner uses uses this analogy
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
frequently and I think it's a good one
 
02:06:47.229 --> 02:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
um imagine if you will uh pool in the
 
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
backyard you have a cup of water you
 
02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
dump the cup of water into the pool then
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
you say well I want my cup of water back
 
02:06:56.109 --> 02:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
right you can't go down to the molecular
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
level and grab every single last water
 
02:07:00.430 --> 02:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
molecule that you dropped into that pool
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
right you can get a cup of water you can
 
02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
make sure it's exactly the same amount
 
02:07:07.229 --> 02:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
but you can't get your cup of water back
 
02:07:08.549 --> 02:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh and the same thing works with
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
electricity right just based on pure
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
physics you cannot track the individual
 
02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
you know electrons wiggling back and
 
02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
forth and the electrical grid is to
 
02:07:17.310 --> 02:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
where it's being generated versus where
 
02:07:19.589 --> 02:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
it's being consumed right it follows the
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
laws of physics wherever there is the
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh um demand for that electricity the
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
electricity will flow in that direction
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
with a couple of exceptions obviously
 
02:07:29.229 --> 02:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
there's lots of switching around of the
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
things um in terms of the actual
 
02:07:33.629 --> 02:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so the wreck is designed
 
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
to solve that question right because if
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
you are right next to a say a wind
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
turbine or a solar array right just
 
02:07:42.750 --> 02:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
based on where the lines are drawn or
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
the where the lines um meet your uh
 
02:07:47.229 --> 02:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
meter all of that electricity would
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily go right to you but right
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
you're not necessarily the one who can
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
claim oh I have 100% r energy just
 
02:07:53.549 --> 02:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
because I happen to live next door to
 
02:07:54.669 --> 02:07:54.679 align:start position:0%
one of these
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
facilities so the r is designed to sort
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
of divide the actual generation from
 
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
electricity to from the actual renewable
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
attributes which is where you're able to
 
02:08:05.709 --> 02:08:05.719 align:start position:0%
say okay I can claim that I am 100%
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
renewable I can claim you know what all
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know those renewable attributes
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
whereas the actual electricity generated
 
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
by those facilities you don't you the
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's just consumed just based on where
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh the interconnection points are so one
 
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
wreck uh is equal to one megawatt hour
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
of electricity production so New
 
02:08:27.870 --> 02:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has four types of uh four
 
02:08:29.790 --> 02:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
classes or four and a half really on is
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
a subset uh within the renewable
 
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard um so you can see
 
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
them on your screen there I'm not going
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
to read each of them but essentially
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
it's class one or are new
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
technologies uh class one thermal which
 
02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
is a subset of class one um is for the
 
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
useful thermal energy so heat
 
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
essentially um that is created by one of
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
these uh resources class class two is
 
02:08:54.990 --> 02:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
solar class three is existing biomass uh
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
as well as methane and then class four
 
02:08:59.310 --> 02:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
is existing small scale hydros um
 
02:09:00.549 --> 02:09:00.559 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be a number of
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
caveats if you look in the statues
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of caveats that
 
02:09:06.030 --> 02:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
that spell out each of those um each of
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
those pieces um but essentially those
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
are sort of the broad categories where
 
02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
those um uh within the RPS of what the
 
02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:17.639 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers need to be able to
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
purchase recks from each of those
 
02:09:20.830 --> 02:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
individual classes so for example if I
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
am a solar array so that's a bad example
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use small scale Hydro so my
 
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
small scale Hydro um that had an
 
02:09:29.709 --> 02:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
inservice date before the date set in
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
statute I am only generating class 4
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
recks for every megawatt hour production
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
that I sent out to the grid so there's a
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
one to one comparison there but it's
 
02:09:40.350 --> 02:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
only class one I'm not generate I'm
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
sorry class four I'm not generating
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
class three I'm not generating class two
 
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
not generating class one it's just class
 
02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:46.549 align:start position:0%
not generating class one it's just class
four

02:09:46.549 --> 02:09:46.559 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
Rex so the way that the uh these re and
 
02:09:51.149 --> 02:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go into more detail about
 
02:09:51.159 --> 02:09:51.830 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go into more detail about
that

02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
a good description of how um re actually
 
02:09:58.030 --> 02:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
function so re themselves um actually I
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say rather generating they're
 
02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
minted um so basically there's like a
 
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
little certificate that comes with each
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
of them um they're bought and sold in an
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
open market So within New England all of
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
these reck trade uh and are offered for
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
sale and then sold and then retired
 
02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
essentially means they're used
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
essentially um on a regional level so
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
that means you know if there is a um uh
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
we'll use the hydroelectric facility
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facility fac is creating
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
class 4 re here in New Hampshire and
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
rting them um they in theory could be
 
02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
bought by a utility in Connecticut and
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
then retired there to meet one of their
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
compliance requirements um the classes
 
02:10:35.109 --> 02:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
all are inter uh are all mixed up so a
 
02:10:37.069 --> 02:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
class one in New Hampshire might be a
 
02:10:38.669 --> 02:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
class three in Vermont might be a class
 
02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
four in Connecticut um so there's
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's a great chart in our annual
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
report that actually overlays each of
 
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
these so these suppliers of electricity
 
02:10:48.549 --> 02:10:48.559 align:start position:0%
have to go out into this open market and
 
02:10:50.669 --> 02:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
buy a certain number of wrecks to meet
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
02:10:56.229 --> 02:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
classes um excuse me to uh to meet the
 
02:10:58.750 --> 02:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
requirements set in the statutes so what
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
happens if they can't find them right
 
02:11:02.549 --> 02:11:02.559 align:start position:0%
what if there's the the there's no none
 
02:11:03.870 --> 02:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
of them are available out there or if
 
02:11:06.069 --> 02:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
they're at a high enough price um they
 
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
are requireed they are allowed to under
 
02:11:09.629 --> 02:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
the statute make what's called an
 
02:11:12.430 --> 02:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payment or an ACP
 
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
so this is a rate that's set in statute
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
that functions as a price cap so and uh
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
prevents the situation where um you know
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
there might be so much demand for
 
02:11:22.990 --> 02:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
particular type of wreck that the price
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
just Spirals and Spirals and spirals
 
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
Because the bidding just keeps driving
 
02:11:27.189 --> 02:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
it higher and higher so the alternative
 
02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
compliance payment basically some
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
functions as a cap where the price may
 
02:11:31.950 --> 02:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
go up and up and up and up then all the
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
way to the cap those um individual uh
 
02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers can just say okay
 
02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
if I were to look in the open market uh
 
02:11:42.109 --> 02:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
the trading price I'm making up numbers
 
02:11:44.549 --> 02:11:44.559 align:start position:0%
here for this wreck is $60 but the ACP
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
is set at 55 I'm going to pay the $55
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
rather than buy this for
 
02:11:54.109 --> 02:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
60 so the way that those the ACP um uh
 
02:11:55.990 --> 02:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
cap is set in statute and then it's
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
indexed for inflation um so it will um
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
as you can see on the slide there uh
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
classes three and four by um CPI with uh
 
02:12:06.910 --> 02:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
classes one and two by half of
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
CPI so what exactly are we talking about
 
02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of the actual settlement of
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
this so for 20 compliance year 2025
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
which is starting uh started just a few
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
days ago January 1 um there's a
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
requirement that
 
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
25.2% of all electricity consumed within
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire must be come
 
02:12:26.910 --> 02:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
come from what are considered renewable
 
02:12:28.589 --> 02:12:28.599 align:start position:0%
resources and the legislature has
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
defined renewable resources within each
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
of those classes so for example this is
 
02:12:34.910 --> 02:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
a a perfect way of walking through and I
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
use try to use numbers that you get nice
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
round number so pretend I am an
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
electricity supplier right and I've sold
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
100 excuse me a th000 megawatt hours of
 
02:12:45.549 --> 02:12:45.559 align:start position:0%
electricity that's tiny for for supplier
 
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
but works for the um example here so if
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
I've sold 1,000 megawatt hour of
 
02:12:53.310 --> 02:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
electricity here in New Hampshire I am
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
required based on the statute and based
 
02:12:57.709 --> 02:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
on the percentages there to obtain and
 
02:13:00.910 --> 02:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
retire 252 wrecks in order to meet that
 
02:13:03.229 --> 02:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
25.2% but it's not just any wreck I need
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
to get a certain number of the right
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of wrecks so for class one I need
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I have 128 non-thermal
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
or just electric wrecks and 22 thermal
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
wrecks to meet my class one obligation
 
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
for class two I'd need to obtain 70
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
wrecks in order to meet that obligation
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
for class three I'd need to to obtain
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
and retire 800 class 3 recks to meet
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
that requirement and finally for class 4
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
I need to obtain and then retire 150
 
02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
recks so all of that uh is done uh
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
within a within a compliance year uh the
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
compliance year runs from January 1st to
 
02:13:44.430 --> 02:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
December 31st of each uh calendar year
 
02:13:46.109 --> 02:13:46.119 align:start position:0%
uh and then there's a compliance period
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
between uh July 1st and July 15th of
 
02:13:51.310 --> 02:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
every year uh where the utilities the uh
 
02:13:54.270 --> 02:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers then report to the
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
Department of their sales and then
 
02:13:57.870 --> 02:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
evidence that they have purchased and
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
then retired the appropriate number of
 
02:14:02.549 --> 02:14:02.559 align:start position:0%
Recs or um at that point they will then
 
02:14:04.030 --> 02:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
make the alternative compliance payment
 
02:14:06.430 --> 02:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
so they'll essentially um pay that uh
 
02:14:07.549 --> 02:14:07.559 align:start position:0%
pay that
 
02:14:10.229 --> 02:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
in uh so any of those funds that are
 
02:14:12.669 --> 02:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
received in um by the department um are
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
deposited into what's referred to as the
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund um and then those
 
02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh funds are used by the department to
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
fund renewable Technologies so uh the re
 
02:14:22.750 --> 02:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
funds as you can see on the screen there
 
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
um three rebate programs for commercial
 
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
industrial solar projects commercial
 
02:14:28.549 --> 02:14:28.559 align:start position:0%
industrial wood pellet projects as well
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
as residential wood pellet projects
 
02:14:32.589 --> 02:14:32.599 align:start position:0%
there's three competitive Grant programs
 
02:14:34.350 --> 02:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
uh a commercial industrial um
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
competitive program that's just open uh
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
a low moderate income solar program uh
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
as well as a municipal solar program so
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
that Municipal solar program um for
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
those of you who were here last year may
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
recall Senate Bill 303 um which directed
 
02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
the department to set up a specific
 
02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:50.559 align:start position:0%
Municipal program we are uh will
 
02:14:53.709 --> 02:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully have a uh straw proposal um
 
02:14:55.950 --> 02:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
out for stakeholder comment in the next
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks here and of course
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
obviously there are costs um born by the
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
department um for both uh on the RPS uh
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
compliance side as well as um uh
 
02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
maintaining uh the the appropriate
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
Administration over these programs um so
 
02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
there's some there's a portion that
 
02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
comes out for administrative fees um and
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
then any related issues is directed in
 
02:15:15.679 --> 02:15:16.470 align:start position:0%
then any related issues is directed in
the

02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
statute so this last slide um this is
 
02:15:21.069 --> 02:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
just to give you a sense of what the
 
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
costs are for the renewable portfolio
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
standard in a given year um so this is
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
back uh back to 2008 with the most
 
02:15:30.189 --> 02:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
recently completed um compliance year
 
02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
being 2023 on the right hand side of
 
02:15:36.629 --> 02:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
your slide there um the green indicated
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh is the cost for the electric supplies
 
02:15:40.629 --> 02:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
of electricity to purchase and then
 
02:15:43.470 --> 02:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
retire those wrecks uh whereas the blue
 
02:15:45.069 --> 02:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
are the alternative compliance payments
 
02:15:46.189 --> 02:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
so those are the payments where they
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
could either could not find or
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
administratively difficult to find uh or
 
02:15:51.870 --> 02:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to um find and retire those
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
recks for those of the payments um that
 
02:15:56.069 --> 02:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
are made into the state so you can see
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
um the renewable portfolio standard had
 
02:16:01.629 --> 02:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
a had an escalator built in um that has
 
02:16:04.069 --> 02:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
has basically it's gone up to 2025 and
 
02:16:05.549 --> 02:16:05.559 align:start position:0%
then we've we've reached the last step
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
so you can see those costs have sort of
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
escalated uh over the recent years with
 
02:16:10.589 --> 02:16:10.599 align:start position:0%
the notable exception of last year but
 
02:16:12.990 --> 02:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
this is a good illustration of why um
 
02:16:14.549 --> 02:16:14.559 align:start position:0%
those renewable energy certificates that
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
are traded uh that there's a regional
 
02:16:19.549 --> 02:16:19.559 align:start position:0%
New England wide market for those which
 
02:16:21.229 --> 02:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
which dictates price so you can see is
 
02:16:23.950 --> 02:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
the U price in any given year um for
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
those uh to settle those wrecks uh
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
varies from year to year so with that
 
02:16:30.669 --> 02:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take a pause there realize
 
02:16:31.830 --> 02:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information a lot of
 
02:16:34.750 --> 02:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
acronyms all thrown in there so thank
 
02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
you I remember in 2015 when I was a
 
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
freshman and I started attending or I
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
attended the orientation of st&amp; and
 
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
there were presentations like yours for
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
two days in a row I remember thinking I
 
02:16:52.110 --> 02:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
was drinking from a fire hose and uh so
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
you've given us a great example of that
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
here today I have two questions for you
 
02:17:00.429 --> 02:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
one is a specific question about uh Rex
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
and the other is a kind of a more
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
general question the the specific
 
02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
question is do you know how many Rex
 
02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
purchased in New Hampshire are sold
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I don't know that number off
 
02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but I can uh I can
 
02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
check with staff and figure out that
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
would vary from year to year um because
 
02:17:22.349 --> 02:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
it would just go of the the price dick
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
and to that point so a New Hampshire
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
class one wreck might have uh attributes
 
02:17:30.030 --> 02:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
that qualify them for uh another New
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
England State's RPS under a different
 
02:17:34.509 --> 02:17:34.519 align:start position:0%
class so um you know these are all
 
02:17:36.429 --> 02:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
happening in a market it can be you know
 
02:17:38.509 --> 02:17:38.519 align:start position:0%
difficult to track oh where did this one
 
02:17:41.629 --> 02:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
specific wreck you know end up uh
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
because that class one wreck in New
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire might be a class whatever in
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
Connecticut okay see what you can do to
 
02:17:51.549 --> 02:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
come up with a a general number if you
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
can my more my broader question is about
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
the whole program itself as you know the
 
02:18:02.750 --> 02:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
program plateaus in
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
2025 when it was originally passed back
 
02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:06.750 align:start position:0%
2025 when it was originally passed back
in

02:18:06.750 --> 02:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
2007 it 2025 seemed like a long way
 
02:18:14.509 --> 02:18:14.519 align:start position:0%
away and I suppose back then it was but
 
02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
we're there now
 
02:18:20.429 --> 02:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
so this would appear to be the correct
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
time to try to evaluate the success or
 
02:18:27.389 --> 02:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
failure of this
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
program so the question for you is does
 
02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
the department have any metrics or
 
02:18:37.790 --> 02:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
any uh
 
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
methodology for determining has the
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
RPS succeeded in achieving its
 
02:18:52.509 --> 02:18:52.519 align:start position:0%
goals or not and if it has not succeeded
 
02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
in achieving its goals what reforms
 
02:18:57.509 --> 02:18:57.519 align:start position:0%
would need to be made to it so that it
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
could achieve its
 
02:19:02.349 --> 02:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
goals thank you that's a great question
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
and so uh you know there is going to be
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
a more comprehensive review I think at
 
02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
statutory um not rules uh of the RPS
 
02:19:12.830 --> 02:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
that that happens this year and that's
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
something that the department will be
 
02:19:16.509 --> 02:19:16.519 align:start position:0%
undertaking you know when you look at
 
02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
and and this kind of goes back to
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan's question from
 
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
earlier you know about being goals
 
02:19:24.349 --> 02:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
oriented and what does that mean you
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
know looking back to the RPS and what
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
sort of the enabling statute uh asks for
 
02:19:32.110 --> 02:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
right you know in in terms of promoting
 
02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
clean energy fuel diversity um and those
 
02:19:37.870 --> 02:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
things are you know New Hampshire
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
Economic Development whatever it might
 
02:19:42.750 --> 02:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
be um those are important goals they're
 
02:19:45.309 --> 02:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
ones that are also oftentimes hard to
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know people can come up with numbers
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
but you know you have to say well what
 
02:19:51.469 --> 02:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
is this dollar really incenting
 
02:19:54.190 --> 02:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
um I will say and I have to be a little
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know not careful but uh we wrote a
 
02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
10-year State energy strategy under the
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
previous administration obviously we've
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
had a a change in executive bran
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
leadership so uh something I didn't note
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
before but I do want to talk about is we
 
02:20:07.389 --> 02:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
are going to be undertaking another
 
02:20:09.230 --> 02:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
revision of the state energy strategy
 
02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
this year um so we will um Mr chairman
 
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
ask to come back and uh present and and
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
take questions from the committee as
 
02:20:20.190 --> 02:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
we're statutorily obligated to do um so
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's something comes in there
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
but so with that caveat uh under the
 
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
current strategy we do suggest what some
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
of those possible reforms could look
 
02:20:29.429 --> 02:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
like uh when it comes to the renewable
 
02:20:32.429 --> 02:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard um as we as we talked
 
02:20:34.590 --> 02:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
about uh we do like market-based
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
approaches and competitive approaches so
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
what can we do to further facilitate um
 
02:20:42.349 --> 02:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
the most efficient selection of
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
resources that meet those goals that we
 
02:20:47.550 --> 02:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
have that the RPS has um we've we've
 
02:20:49.870 --> 02:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
asked the question um and I know it's
 
02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
come up in the past
 
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
why not a resource like nuclear why not
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
a resource like larger scale Hydro that
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
might be able to achieve or help us
 
02:21:02.030 --> 02:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
achieve some of those um clean energy um
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know considerations some of those uh
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh energy diversity considerations and
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
and frankly might have uh you know good
 
02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
Economic Development opportunities in
 
02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh why do we have so many
 
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
classes and why do we not uh encourage
 
02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
further competition not not between say
 
02:21:22.349 --> 02:21:22.359 align:start position:0%
a fossil fuel resource and a renewable
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
resource but but within those renewable
 
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
energy resources why why not say you
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
know let's find one that helps us meet
 
02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
or or find whichever ones help us meet
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
that those goals in the most uh cost
 
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
effective way possible um you know the
 
02:21:38.469 --> 02:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
current situation I I would Hazard to
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
guess does probably leave some meat on
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
the bone when it comes to um you know uh
 
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
providing uh Financial incentives to
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
resources that might be beyond what is
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to actually incent that
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
resource uh but because there are um
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
these these very strict uh classes um we
 
02:22:01.950 --> 02:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
we we might not be seeing the most
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
efficient selection of those of those
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
resources so um you know we are
 
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
undertaking a we're going to be
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
undertaking a review uh and that's part
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
of what came in with the uh maturity of
 
02:22:15.790 --> 02:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
of the RPS in
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
2025 okay additional questions
 
02:22:20.910 --> 02:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you micher uh actually um very
 
02:22:25.710 --> 02:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
similar question to what the chairman
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
asked but I was going to ask it in more
 
02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:29.190 align:start position:0%
asked but I was going to ask it in more
simplistic

02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
simplistic
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
terms and basically for the benefit of
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
our newest members here the um the
 
02:22:39.309 --> 02:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
briefing you gave excellent briefing but
 
02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
could you
 
02:22:43.950 --> 02:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
explain why or what was the original
 
02:22:48.910 --> 02:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of the RPS program um and to
 
02:22:51.389 --> 02:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
that question
 
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
what happens when we meet that purpose
 
02:22:57.070 --> 02:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
or is this a particular purpose that has
 
02:23:00.910 --> 02:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
no end so can you address those concerns
 
02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
sure and and I'll just give you I was in
 
02:23:04.510 --> 02:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
high school when when this came into
 
02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
effect so I don't I wasn't there for the
 
02:23:08.270 --> 02:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
legislative uh you know history there I
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
you know there are legislative findings
 
02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
that talk about the value of um you know
 
02:23:16.190 --> 02:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh renewable resources and and uh you
 
02:23:18.349 --> 02:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
know fuel diversity economic development
 
02:23:19.950 --> 02:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so I think that those
 
02:23:25.309 --> 02:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
are uh laid out in in the statute
 
02:23:28.469 --> 02:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
um yeah uh so you
 
02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
know when it comes to achieve achieving
 
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
those right you know uh I think we would
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
all agree we want to make sure we meet
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
our goals uh as cost effectively as
 
02:23:40.590 --> 02:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
possible right uh so that's that's
 
02:23:43.389 --> 02:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
really something that people uh need to
 
02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
do and I'm sorry I forgot the if I left
 
02:23:47.150 --> 02:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
out part of your
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
question well uh I was trying to get you
 
02:23:55.150 --> 02:23:55.160 align:start position:0%
to talk about what happens when we get
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
there is this is this a program that has
 
02:24:00.590 --> 02:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
an endpoint or is a program with no end
 
02:24:01.790 --> 02:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
because people just wanted to keep
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
continuing sure yeah and and yeah
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
apologies for losing it there yeah no uh
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have an end point right now
 
02:24:10.030 --> 02:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh under statute it plateaus at this
 
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
25.2% level um again that 25.2 does have
 
02:24:16.510 --> 02:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
some fluctuation in it and Josh didn't
 
02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
get into it I don't think but you know
 
02:24:20.110 --> 02:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
the department does have the ability to
 
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
adjust just classes three and four based
 
02:24:24.429 --> 02:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
on sort of what the availability might
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
be um you know because there are
 
02:24:27.790 --> 02:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances where you know for
 
02:24:29.710 --> 02:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
instance if they're and we've done this
 
02:24:31.710 --> 02:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
the past three or four years uh where
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
there just weren't going to be enough uh
 
02:24:36.429 --> 02:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
wrecks available for class three if it
 
02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
represents 8% of our generation at a
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
high ACP it was just going to be
 
02:24:43.190 --> 02:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
needlessly expensive for rate payers so
 
02:24:45.269 --> 02:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
we've we had the legislative authority
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
to uh bring that down in previous last
 
02:24:49.030 --> 02:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
two years I think it was we've brought
 
02:24:52.269 --> 02:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
it down to 0.5% % from the eight um and
 
02:24:54.150 --> 02:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're undergoing a proceeding to look at
 
02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:57.230 align:start position:0%
we're undergoing a proceeding to look at
that

02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:00.030 --> 02:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
currently okay representative McGee did
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
you have your hand
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
up I did it's easier to ask who doesn't
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
have their hand up from the looks of it
 
02:25:12.510 --> 02:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
okay so um I I had a couple of thoughts
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
um so we're talking about class three
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
and that's an interesting place to start
 
02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
when we talk about RPS conception
 
02:25:23.150 --> 02:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
or whether it's good whether it's bad
 
02:25:25.309 --> 02:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
whether it's meeting its goals uh
 
02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
whatever those are um for me it would be
 
02:25:31.469 --> 02:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
important to bring it back to who are
 
02:25:33.389 --> 02:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
using these wrecks who are benefiting
 
02:25:35.630 --> 02:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
from these wrecks who are
 
02:25:39.990 --> 02:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
operating uh their generation concerns
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
based on you know the the Rex being a
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
part of the economic model that allows
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
them to operate in the state um class 3
 
02:25:50.670 --> 02:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
Rex went down I was here when we passed
 
02:25:53.469 --> 02:25:53.479 align:start position:0%
the biomass Bill HP 183 it's burned in
 
02:25:58.030 --> 02:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
my head um that affected many biomass uh
 
02:26:00.269 --> 02:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
who were indigenous
 
02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
businesses and we didn't spend a lot of
 
02:26:06.389 --> 02:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
we we heard from them but we didn't
 
02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time
 
02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
discussing the impacts of those you know
 
02:26:13.630 --> 02:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire-based
 
02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh generation facilities that also were
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
helping the timber industry you know
 
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
they had a lot of connections to other
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
um economic interests in the state of
 
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and so I guess my
 
02:26:30.670 --> 02:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
question is we seem to be talking about
 
02:26:33.070 --> 02:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
this as something out there that are
 
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
just three letters that we can just do
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
something but we're not talking about it
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of what does the RPS mean to
 
02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
indigenous Industries and businesses in
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so that we can understand
 
02:26:48.269 --> 02:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
the impact of any decision that we make
 
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not really giving us
 
02:26:51.070 --> 02:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
enough information
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
about uh my understanding is the RPS was
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
set up in order to help us reach a goal
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
by 2025 of 25% of our energy generation
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
being done with Renewables or with
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
cleaner energy sources right so we set
 
02:27:08.429 --> 02:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
that as a goal we may be fairly close to
 
02:27:09.750 --> 02:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
that with what's going on behind the
 
02:27:11.469 --> 02:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
meter I don't know you guys haven't told
 
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
us that but rather than just throwing it
 
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
up in the air without even having
 
02:27:19.309 --> 02:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
discussed the actual impacts on maybe
 
02:27:22.110 --> 02:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
some of the people in this room and also
 
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
um you know some of the businesses that
 
02:27:26.670 --> 02:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
are genuinely trying to create Supply
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
diversity in the state can you just talk
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit because Supply
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
diversity actually it doesn't just help
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
us with reliability it helps us keep
 
02:27:38.830 --> 02:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
dollars in the state our energy dollars
 
02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
in the state and it um it makes us more
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
secure it it it helps lower some of the
 
02:27:46.269 --> 02:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
risk of us having to get everything from
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
out of state so I think it's worth
 
02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
talking about and that's what I would
 
02:27:53.309 --> 02:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
like to understand is what what does
 
02:27:55.070 --> 02:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
this chart represent in terms of
 
02:27:56.349 --> 02:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
businesses I know I've talked to the
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
hydro industry about how important the
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
recks are to them
 
02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
so sure and and I will just note and
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's a very good question and and I
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
think we'll we could probably get you
 
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
the actual sort of breakdown of what
 
02:28:11.070 --> 02:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
percentage of uh the obligation is met
 
02:28:12.990 --> 02:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
through renewable energy certificates
 
02:28:15.550 --> 02:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
versus uh through alternative compliance
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
payments so that's something we can
 
02:28:19.389 --> 02:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
provide for the committee um you know
 
02:28:20.429 --> 02:28:20.439 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the Economic
 
02:28:21.630 --> 02:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
Development question I'm I'm just going
 
02:28:23.590 --> 02:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
to say you know our job is to administer
 
02:28:25.269 --> 02:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
the program and make it happen right you
 
02:28:26.670 --> 02:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
know it's up to the legislature to
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
determine you know what all of those uh
 
02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
values and benefits are that that uh you
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
know you get from the program and and
 
02:28:36.429 --> 02:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
they're obviously State energy or excuse
 
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
me state agencies that um are focused on
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
on you know like the Department of
 
02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs you know
 
02:28:45.469 --> 02:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
we've heard from dncr uh in the past on
 
02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
biomass specific bills um you know that
 
02:28:50.309 --> 02:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
Economic Development question is an
 
02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
important one it's one that is not
 
02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily one that falls within the
 
02:28:55.710 --> 02:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
the purview of the Department of energy
 
02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:56.550 align:start position:0%
the purview of the Department of energy
in

02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
administering um the program because we
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
aren't we aren't just sort of like
 
02:29:02.990 --> 02:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
picking you know this is what the
 
02:29:05.950 --> 02:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
obligation is uh you know 25.2 that's
 
02:29:07.389 --> 02:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
obviously something that the legislature
 
02:29:10.349 --> 02:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
has has done for us so I I do have the
 
02:29:11.950 --> 02:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
the comfortable position of saying it
 
02:29:14.190 --> 02:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
really is up to to you guys to determine
 
02:29:16.830 --> 02:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
what the what the benefits going to be
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
um but yeah no uh going back to what the
 
02:29:21.150 --> 02:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
goal is it really is you know the RPS is
 
02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
designed to be either that that missing
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
money or that additional Financial
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
incentive towards generating resources
 
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh that might not otherwise be
 
02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
economical right so we're we're
 
02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
providing money because you know if you
 
02:29:34.590 --> 02:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
just had to compete in the market these
 
02:29:36.870 --> 02:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
are resources that might not be selected
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
at least that's the argument that folks
 
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
are are are making so um if you have a
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know uh a Rec you know trading for
 
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
$25 a megawatt hour or something like
 
02:29:50.190 --> 02:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
that uh that's an extra $25 that that's
 
02:29:52.990 --> 02:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
going to help make that resource
 
02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
economical um you know we've heard a lot
 
02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
of conversation when it comes to biomass
 
02:29:59.070 --> 02:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
right that you know there are those
 
02:30:01.469 --> 02:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
benefits uh for economic development
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
that you know in the timber industry um
 
02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
you know for Trucking and for all of
 
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
those sort of like uh Downstream
 
02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
businesses that help turn you know wood
 
02:30:16.269 --> 02:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
into electricity um it's it's not it is
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
a state concern but the department of
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
Energy's Focus really is to administer
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
the program uh as we've been instructed
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
by the legislature a very brief followup
 
02:30:30.349 --> 02:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
just a very simple question um so the
 
02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
simple follow-up would be does the
 
02:30:34.030 --> 02:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy still look at
 
02:30:37.469 --> 02:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
Supply diversity as one of the goals
 
02:30:40.190 --> 02:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
that we have in the
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Corman thank you Mr
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
question actually
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh have two questions first one is
 
02:30:54.990 --> 02:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the chart that's up there we
 
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
see a big drop in
 
02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
2023 for the uh cost of Rex uh the total
 
02:31:03.710 --> 02:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
cost and I'm wondering uh was that
 
02:31:05.950 --> 02:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
because there's an increased Supply or
 
02:31:09.389 --> 02:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
something else second question is how
 
02:31:12.429 --> 02:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
closely are individual wrecks tracked I
 
02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
have uh a solar array at my house I'm
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
selling recks I sell them to a
 
02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
broker and and I don't really know what
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
happens to them after that I don't know
 
02:31:25.429 --> 02:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
if they're being retired within the
 
02:31:29.309 --> 02:31:29.319 align:start position:0%
state or not within the state um how is
 
02:31:33.389 --> 02:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
my wreck tracked through the
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
system so I'm going to answer that in
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
reverse order so right so you take your
 
02:31:38.950 --> 02:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
individual individual recks from your
 
02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
solar rate right you've I've sort of
 
02:31:42.030 --> 02:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
left this part out but right there are
 
02:31:43.469 --> 02:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
these Brokers that exist that will
 
02:31:45.630 --> 02:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
collect all these Recs from um whether
 
02:31:47.230 --> 02:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's from large facilities or small
 
02:31:49.150 --> 02:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
smaller facilities like yourselves um
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
and bundle them so they're easier for
 
02:31:53.269 --> 02:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
these suppliers to actually buy an
 
02:31:54.910 --> 02:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
aggregate rather than say okay well
 
02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative Corman I'm going to buy
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
your three wrecks I'm going to buy two
 
02:31:58.590 --> 02:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
recks here right and they're going
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
through the whole
 
02:32:03.150 --> 02:32:03.160 align:start position:0%
process um so those wrecks um are then
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
once they are um uh aggregated they're
 
02:32:08.349 --> 02:32:08.359 align:start position:0%
then sold um to one of those electricity
 
02:32:10.110 --> 02:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
suppliers somewhere in New England so
 
02:32:14.030 --> 02:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
your wreck in theory um could be uh
 
02:32:16.110 --> 02:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
settled in Connecticut so they could say
 
02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay well I've purchased this wreck even
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
though it's from New Hampshire um it
 
02:32:19.439 --> 02:32:20.429 align:start position:0%
though it's from New Hampshire um it
means

02:32:20.429 --> 02:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:32:22.590 --> 02:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
the the qualifications for I'm making up
 
02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
a number here but a class one wreck in
 
02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
Connecticut we're going to retire them
 
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
say it's uh ever Source I'm they're
 
02:32:29.710 --> 02:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
going to purchase it and they're going
 
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
to retire in
 
02:32:33.070 --> 02:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
Connecticut there's a system called uh
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
knole GIS which if anybody uh is
 
02:32:37.309 --> 02:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
involved in like mapping at the local
 
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
level it's different than the gis system
 
02:32:41.070 --> 02:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
that's used for mapping it's a slightly
 
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
different it's a different thing but it
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
has the same acronym um there's uh so
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
there are individual that all of that
 
02:32:48.990 --> 02:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
gets logged in that system so they know
 
02:32:52.110 --> 02:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
that your w are only sold once and then
 
02:32:54.070 --> 02:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
from you to the supplier uh to the um
 
02:32:56.910 --> 02:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me to the the um broker excuse me
 
02:32:58.910 --> 02:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um and then sold once from the
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
broker to the um supplier of electricity
 
02:33:03.150 --> 02:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
and then retired so they basically
 
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
there's they're tracked all the way
 
02:33:07.070 --> 02:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
through the system um regarding the drop
 
02:33:09.710 --> 02:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
in 2023 um it's Confluence of a number
 
02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
of factors um mostly it's just a uh the
 
02:33:14.429 --> 02:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
ACP it's sort of hard to tell from this
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
did come down a little bit um over prior
 
02:33:19.349 --> 02:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
years um but the record costs um just
 
02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
increase Supply and then there's always
 
02:33:22.630 --> 02:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
policy decisions made by other states
 
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
that then influence the trading of those
 
02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
Recs across the
 
02:33:29.710 --> 02:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
region representative Summers has your
 
02:33:31.870 --> 02:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:33:34.590 --> 02:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I'm
 
02:33:37.389 --> 02:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
actually looking at just quickly that
 
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the different classes of Rex
 
02:33:42.389 --> 02:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
and I know as of last year um because
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're in ISO New England our neighbor to
 
02:33:47.070 --> 02:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
the South Massachusetts basically had
 
02:33:49.309 --> 02:33:49.319 align:start position:0%
taken our whole entire class three there
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
and has passed a law stating that class
 
02:33:54.590 --> 02:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
3 is bad for the environment so now they
 
02:33:57.469 --> 02:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
no longer include that in their RPS just
 
02:33:59.910 --> 02:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that in as a note secondly
 
02:34:03.550 --> 02:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
I noticed that um multiple states in the
 
02:34:06.030 --> 02:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
United States um view because of the
 
02:34:10.030 --> 02:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
time the visionable material Burns and
 
02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
all BLS and also it's the that multiple
 
02:34:16.750 --> 02:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
states were uh view nuclear power as a
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
renewable product would legislation be
 
02:34:23.269 --> 02:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
be needed to a Define nuclear power as a
 
02:34:25.630 --> 02:34:25.640 align:start position:0%
Renewable Power and secondly to add it
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
as one of the classes on
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
here yes we uh are the classes are are
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
parial thank you chair I'd feel remous
 
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
if I didn't ask about the practice uh
 
02:34:48.190 --> 02:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
that many people in the state consider
 
02:34:50.349 --> 02:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
uh distorting our recom Mark and that is
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
the practice of Rec sweeping um to avoid
 
02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments could
 
02:34:57.389 --> 02:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
you speak to that a little
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
bit in terms of the process or the
 
02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:01.590 align:start position:0%
bit in terms of the process or the
policy

02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:35:04.830 --> 02:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
or more the process and whether or not
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
policy is uh uh needed to circum to uh
 
02:35:12.590 --> 02:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
clean up that process we are looking at
 
02:35:15.389 --> 02:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
a review as you said in Du 2025 is this
 
02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
a good time to examine that as
 
02:35:21.269 --> 02:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
well so that is a separate process um I
 
02:35:23.469 --> 02:35:23.479 align:start position:0%
don't know if it would necessarily be oh
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh I would have to go back and look at
 
02:35:27.070 --> 02:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
the actual statute to specify whether it
 
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
it requests us to look at that
 
02:35:32.469 --> 02:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
particular aspect um for for the the
 
02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
larger committee this the idea of Rec
 
02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
sweeping essentially it's a um a
 
02:35:39.710 --> 02:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
settlement process um by which uh there
 
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
are a number of of smaller suppliers I'm
 
02:35:43.230 --> 02:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
going to use representative Corman for
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
example where if they decide it is not
 
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
worth their time or their effort to
 
02:35:49.230 --> 02:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
register with neol GIS in order to
 
02:35:51.830 --> 02:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
actually generate and sell those wrecks
 
02:35:53.790 --> 02:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me to Mint those wrecks excuse
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
me um they've opted not to do that
 
02:35:58.349 --> 02:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
process and it can be a long process um
 
02:36:01.230 --> 02:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
for something that may be worth 20ish
 
02:36:03.550 --> 02:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
dollars depending on the size of AR Ray
 
02:36:04.910 --> 02:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
um so there are some folks who just opt
 
02:36:08.750 --> 02:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
not to do it um as part of the statute
 
02:36:10.910 --> 02:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
um of course we've touched briefly on
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
net metering um as those uh utility uh
 
02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
companies are purchasing that uh
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
electricity that's generated back or
 
02:36:21.590 --> 02:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
netting it against um your um purchasing
 
02:36:23.269 --> 02:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
the exports then crediting it against
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
any of your Imports of electricity to
 
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
get that netting that happens um the
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
statute allows them to essentially to um
 
02:36:32.590 --> 02:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
acquire those renewable energy
 
02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
certificates now there's a question of
 
02:36:38.429 --> 02:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
and then use them in order to um meet
 
02:36:40.349 --> 02:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
the demand excuse me meet the
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
requirements of Class 2 um in New
 
02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um there is a question I know
 
02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
this has been debated multiple times in
 
02:36:48.670 --> 02:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
front of this committee before um you
 
02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
can either do it one you can do it the
 
02:36:52.230 --> 02:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
other way this avoids double counting of
 
02:36:54.030 --> 02:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
recks so they're not going to two places
 
02:36:55.389 --> 02:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
at the same time so we know that they're
 
02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
being done once um the other option um
 
02:37:00.269 --> 02:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
there have been a variety of different
 
02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
legislative uh attempts to change this
 
02:37:05.309 --> 02:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
policy um it would be really the purview
 
02:37:07.710 --> 02:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
of the legislature as to whether or not
 
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
um those wrecks how to handle those
 
02:37:15.230 --> 02:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
wrecks at the end of the day
 
02:37:18.269 --> 02:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
02:37:20.070 --> 02:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here Joshua you did
 
02:37:24.349 --> 02:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
a really good job explaining this um to
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
use your example about wrecks um if a
 
02:37:29.790 --> 02:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
wreck cost $50 and an ACP and we're just
 
02:37:32.110 --> 02:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
using it as an example cost
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
55 it's theoretical that during an
 
02:37:37.269 --> 02:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
auction some recks will not be
 
02:37:39.790 --> 02:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
purchased what happens to those wrecks
 
02:37:41.469 --> 02:37:41.479 align:start position:0%
if they're not purchased are they rolled
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
over or do they die a of untimely death
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's a very good question so um the
 
02:37:53.269 --> 02:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
Rex uh themselves um if the ACP uh sorry
 
02:37:54.990 --> 02:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
let me back up so in that scenario where
 
02:37:56.590 --> 02:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
the actual trading price of the wreck is
 
02:37:59.870 --> 02:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
$55 and the ACP is 50 it means that one
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
of the other states around us the the
 
02:38:04.670 --> 02:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
whatever their ACP value is higher so it
 
02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
makes more sense for I will use I'm not
 
02:38:08.110 --> 02:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
trying to pick on eversource but I know
 
02:38:09.389 --> 02:38:09.399 align:start position:0%
they operate in three states in the
 
02:38:12.510 --> 02:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
region they've decided that um a wreck
 
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
they may have purchased they could
 
02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
either um retire in Connecticut or they
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
could retire to New Hampshire and say
 
02:38:20.349 --> 02:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
the ACP is much higher in Connecticut it
 
02:38:22.590 --> 02:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
makes more sense to pay the ACP here and
 
02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
retire the wreck in Connecticut um
 
02:38:26.710 --> 02:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
utilities are also allowed to bank
 
02:38:29.469 --> 02:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
wrecks um so for example if they um over
 
02:38:32.429 --> 02:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
buy or something like that happens um
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to carry them forward to
 
02:38:35.710 --> 02:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
the next year um I believe it's a limit
 
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
up to 20% of their obligation I will
 
02:38:41.269 --> 02:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
need to double check on that yeah okay
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
people behind me are nodding yes um that
 
02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
they can carry those forward um as far
 
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
as an
 
02:38:50.190 --> 02:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
expiration dat two years years okay yes
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh So within two years of gener two
 
02:38:54.550 --> 02:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
years of being minted excuse me thank
 
02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chairman thanks again
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
guys for being here and taking my
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
question um I just wanted to ask you um
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
rather directly about if whether you
 
02:39:17.269 --> 02:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
have uh data or just a feeling e some
 
02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
explanation or whether or a theory uh if
 
02:39:23.269 --> 02:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
you could to what do you attribute when
 
02:39:25.630 --> 02:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
you look at the graph that we've had the
 
02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
compliance costs of uh the
 
02:39:33.910 --> 02:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
RPS um up to 2023 you know you see a
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
peak in 2019 and then since then uh what
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
I would call a pretty precipitous drop
 
02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know down down uh small Rebound in
 
02:39:46.510 --> 02:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
2022 but then a big drop so if you draw
 
02:39:49.070 --> 02:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
a line from 2019 to 2023 there's almost
 
02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:50.110 align:start position:0%
a line from 2019 to 2023 there's almost
a

02:39:50.110 --> 02:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:39:53.710 --> 02:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
you know we call it a 45% looks like
 
02:39:56.670 --> 02:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
Drop in compliance
 
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
costs to what do you attribute
 
02:40:03.030 --> 02:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
that so as mentioned previously there's
 
02:40:04.990 --> 02:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
a there's a regional Rec excuse me a
 
02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
regional market for Rex um it's hard to
 
02:40:10.269 --> 02:40:10.279 align:start position:0%
say pinpoint exactly what what thing
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
happened where to sort of drop it um but
 
02:40:15.510 --> 02:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
it is it's a larger Regional phenomenon
 
02:40:16.870 --> 02:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
where there' just been more recks that
 
02:40:18.349 --> 02:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
would be available so they'd be able to
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
be purchased at a lower cost um and
 
02:40:24.830 --> 02:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
therefore um reduced compliance
 
02:40:27.670 --> 02:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
cost well and yeah and obviously the uh
 
02:40:29.309 --> 02:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
the reduction in class three we have not
 
02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
done that uh that's been a more recent
 
02:40:35.269 --> 02:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
um uh development as as sort of just
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
sort of the biomass Market has evolved
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
and so that would uh be responsible uh
 
02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
change okay thank you okay
 
02:40:50.830 --> 02:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
representative B has a question thank
 
02:40:52.750 --> 02:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
you chairman uh this is more of a
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
clarification question this chart
 
02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that this is for New
 
02:40:58.670 --> 02:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but uh understanding that this
 
02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
is for New Hampshire that might Explain
 
02:41:03.550 --> 02:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
how other states might um compensate
 
02:41:04.910 --> 02:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
some of the cost
 
02:41:07.030 --> 02:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah for sure so this is New
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific if you look at
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts with their um their
 
02:41:12.349 --> 02:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
variety they have different they have
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know three or four different
 
02:41:14.469 --> 02:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
programs that are you know there's a
 
02:41:15.630 --> 02:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
clean energy standard there's a
 
02:41:17.070 --> 02:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard there's a
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
clean Peak standard all sorts of things
 
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
like that their total cost and the last
 
02:41:22.590 --> 02:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
time I saw data I think it was from 2022
 
02:41:24.469 --> 02:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
they were a little behind on on where
 
02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
they were but they had projected their
 
02:41:29.870 --> 02:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
cost between a billion 1.5 billion
 
02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
dollars uh per year in Massachusetts so
 
02:41:33.630 --> 02:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a significant scale
 
02:41:35.830 --> 02:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
associated with with other states and
 
02:41:37.750 --> 02:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
obviously you know with their five times
 
02:41:39.309 --> 02:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
uh our size so that's that's going to
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
get baked into it but even accounting
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
for that fact they have a pretty
 
02:41:47.710 --> 02:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:51.389 --> 02:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr
 
02:41:53.479 --> 02:41:55.030 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr
chair

02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:41:57.950 --> 02:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh despite having my background in Astro
 
02:41:59.710 --> 02:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
engineering and sometimes being called a
 
02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
space cadet I am very impressed with the
 
02:42:05.550 --> 02:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
uh kind of the the fundamental
 
02:42:08.190 --> 02:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
accounting details behind all this but
 
02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's kind of been asked and
 
02:42:13.469 --> 02:42:13.479 align:start position:0%
maybe addressed but can and I'm looking
 
02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
at so this has been a period of 15 years
 
02:42:17.389 --> 02:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
this has been going
 
02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
on uh and and how has this do you feel
 
02:42:26.269 --> 02:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
like this has changed the mix of energy
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
production in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:34.590 --> 02:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
years it's a good question and it's one
 
02:42:36.910 --> 02:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm I you know I i' probably want
 
02:42:38.670 --> 02:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
to talk to some folks in the agency
 
02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
before you know attributing success to
 
02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
to one resource or another over the last
 
02:42:45.550 --> 02:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
20 years we've seen a significant change
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
in the resource mix uh most of that
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen through the the uh change
 
02:42:54.990 --> 02:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
from oil and coal as being you know
 
02:42:56.590 --> 02:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
primary and and certainly significant
 
02:42:59.630 --> 02:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
resources to to Natural Gas being the
 
02:43:02.110 --> 02:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
the the you know Top Dog uh in New
 
02:43:04.469 --> 02:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
England uh most of that has been driven
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily by policy as much as it
 
02:43:08.710 --> 02:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
has been by economics and that's just
 
02:43:11.550 --> 02:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
because natural gas uh especially with
 
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
the sort of prevalence of you know the
 
02:43:16.469 --> 02:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
Marcel Shale uh kind of explosion around
 
02:43:18.630 --> 02:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
the time that this went into effect uh
 
02:43:23.870 --> 02:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
we saw uh a significant um price uh
 
02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
dampening from that and that made
 
02:43:27.550 --> 02:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
natural natural gas a much more
 
02:43:31.790 --> 02:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
economical resource um obviously State
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
policy um both for RPS and in other
 
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
areas of of decarbonization that we've
 
02:43:39.950 --> 02:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
seen throughout New England you know our
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
resource mix in 20 years could look very
 
02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
different than it does today and I think
 
02:43:47.309 --> 02:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
that's the goal of of a lot of folks um
 
02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
how much I'm going to attribute that to
 
02:43:52.469 --> 02:43:52.479 align:start position:0%
RPS specifically in New Hampshire i' I'd
 
02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
love to get back to you especially I
 
02:43:55.550 --> 02:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
know you have a number of bills on this
 
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
topic and uh you'll you'll certainly
 
02:44:02.269 --> 02:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:04.670 --> 02:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
then okay gentlemen I want to thank you
 
02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
very much for being here an excellent
 
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
presentation as always from the
 
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
department and at this point in time
 
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a lunch break and we
 
02:44:20.230 --> 02:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
will come back at 1:00 to hear from the
 
02:44:23.269 --> 02:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission Now during
 
02:44:27.750 --> 02:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
our orientation hour between 9 and 10 I
 
02:44:29.950 --> 02:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
had suggested that we would talk about
 
02:44:32.670 --> 02:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
public hearings and executive sessions
 
02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
but we ran out of time and did not have
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
that discussion so we will have that
 
02:44:42.269 --> 02:44:42.279 align:start position:0%
discussion at a future date we could
 
02:44:44.870 --> 02:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
talk about it this afternoon if the
 
02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
committee has the energy to hang out and
 
02:44:51.550 --> 02:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
talk about it or we could uh bring that
 
02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
up maybe next week before we start some
 
02:44:56.870 --> 02:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
public hearings we'll have that
 
02:45:01.550 --> 02:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:03.349 align:start position:0%
 
day

02:45:03.349 --> 02:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
pardon we do uh so maybe we should have
 
02:45:09.990 --> 02:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
that discussion today if we if we if we
 
02:45:11.830 --> 02:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
have if we have a chance if we have the
 
02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
energy uh and the stamina so anyway go
 
02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
get some lunch and we'll see you all
 
02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:47.920 --> 02:46:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:46:17.910 --> 02:46:17.920 align:start position:0%

Dan goldner I've been the chair for the
 
04:01:16.670 --> 04:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
last three years and was a commissioner

30 years in the defense and
 
04:01:23.870 --> 04:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
semiconductor businesses um beginning as
 
04:01:26.389 --> 04:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
a design engineer I moved on to program
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
management and eventually became the
 
04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
Vice President of Finance and operations

Instruments and um have worked all over
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
I've lived in Texas I've lived in
 
04:01:36.349 --> 04:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
California I lived in Oso Norway for
 
04:01:38.670 --> 04:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
three years and spent the last 10 years
 
04:01:42.189 --> 04:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
on down at Manchester on Granite

Bachelor of Science mechanical
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
engineering and an
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
NBA so without any further Ado uh going
 
04:01:55.670 --> 04:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
to the first slide uh this is sort of a
 
04:01:59.550 --> 04:01:59.560 align:start position:0%
picture of what we regulate at the Pu so
 
04:02:02.110 --> 04:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
it's about7 billion doll in assets about
 
04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
two billion in annual revenue so there's
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh a lot of money in this
 
04:02:11.070 --> 04:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
business the chart to your upper left is
 
04:02:11.080 --> 04:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
business the chart to your upper left is
a

04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
picture of the electric utilities uh the
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
picture to the upper right is the Gas
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
Utilities the chart on the bottom shows
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
that ever sources is about 80% of the
 
04:02:25.870 --> 04:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
customer base uh here in New Hampshire
 
04:02:29.229 --> 04:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
and the Liberty has about 73% of the gas
 
04:02:31.710 --> 04:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
customers here in New Hampshire and off
 
04:02:33.670 --> 04:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
to the right is a list of the regulated
 
04:02:36.590 --> 04:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
Water Systems the list of sewer
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
utilities and then a brief note on our
 
04:02:42.510 --> 04:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
very limited engagement in
 
04:02:45.229 --> 04:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
Telecom all right right so you know why
 
04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
do we need a pu is the next
 
04:02:51.309 --> 04:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
question um so we we're really about
 
04:02:53.189 --> 04:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
checks and balances so
 
04:02:56.590 --> 04:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
monopolies um don't have competition
 
04:02:58.670 --> 04:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
they can exploit their Market Power by
 
04:03:00.990 --> 04:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
charging excessively high prices they
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
can limit output they can reduce the
 
04:03:03.990 --> 04:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
quality of goods and services and they
 
04:03:05.189 --> 04:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
can hinder
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
Innovation so you know ultimately this
 
04:03:10.309 --> 04:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
harms consumers and the overall economy
 
04:03:12.630 --> 04:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
our powers are delegated from the US
 
04:03:15.670 --> 04:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution and ultimately ly the um
 
04:03:17.070 --> 04:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature here in New Hampshire
 
04:03:19.950 --> 04:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
under article 83 and I've provided here
 
04:03:21.750 --> 04:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
just a brief history of Monopoly
 
04:03:23.790 --> 04:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
regulation in New Hampshire which really
 
04:03:25.950 --> 04:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
for the Pu starts in
 
04:03:29.110 --> 04:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
1911 and uh we changed our name in
 
04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
1951 and so this regulation in gas
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
electric and water in Telecom has been
 
04:03:37.710 --> 04:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
going on for over a 100
 
04:03:41.189 --> 04:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
years on the next slide I called it old
 
04:03:44.070 --> 04:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
versus new PU
 
04:03:46.349 --> 04:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
and this is the legislative changes from
 
04:03:46.359 --> 04:03:47.510 align:start position:0%
and this is the legislative changes from
July

04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
July
 
04:03:49.710 --> 04:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
2021 for those of you that were here
 
04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
then and just as a brief recap uh the
 
04:03:54.750 --> 04:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
old commission was three Commissioners
 
04:03:57.309 --> 04:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
nine divisions more than 70 people and a
 
04:03:58.790 --> 04:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
wide variety of
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
functions staff of the PC proferred
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
positions to the Commissioners in each
 
04:04:06.269 --> 04:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
docket staff negotiated settlements with
 
04:04:08.349 --> 04:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
the utilities the OCA and the special
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
interests outside of the of the
 
04:04:12.790 --> 04:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process and presented to
 
04:04:14.590 --> 04:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
the commission for approve
 
04:04:18.030 --> 04:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
approval and you know with adjudication
 
04:04:20.269 --> 04:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
policy audit and enforcement in a single
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
organization there could be the
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
appearance of impropriety the same folks
 
04:04:26.189 --> 04:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
that are negotiating the deal the same
 
04:04:28.349 --> 04:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
organization that's negotiating the deal
 
04:04:30.030 --> 04:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
is also approving the deal so the
 
04:04:33.309 --> 04:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
legislature responded to that in 2021 by
 
04:04:35.590 --> 04:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
splitting off the doe and making the
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
commission a separate independent and
 
04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
firewalled uh organization to ensure
 
04:04:45.030 --> 04:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
impartial and neutral decision-making
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
the due at that same time was spun off
 
04:04:52.030 --> 04:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
per RSA 12p and is an automatic party to
 
04:04:52.040 --> 04:04:52.750 align:start position:0%
per RSA 12p and is an automatic party to
all

04:04:52.750 --> 04:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:04:55.149 --> 04:04:55.159 align:start position:0%
proceedings and uh is to provide the
 
04:04:56.710 --> 04:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
commission with independent information
 
04:04:59.189 --> 04:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
on the record used to render reasoned
 
04:05:01.149 --> 04:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
sound and fair decisions I know there's
 
04:05:03.710 --> 04:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
some legislation that talks about uh
 
04:05:06.030 --> 04:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
different responsibilities for the doe
 
04:05:07.349 --> 04:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
the only thing we at the PC would
 
04:05:10.870 --> 04:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
suggest is just to uh think about a
 
04:05:12.910 --> 04:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
counterparty to the Monopoly whoever
 
04:05:15.309 --> 04:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
that is whether that's in the doe or the
 
04:05:17.790 --> 04:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
AG's office or in the commission itself
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
whatever it is there just needs to be a
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
counterparty to the
 
04:05:22.590 --> 04:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
Monopoly and then finally and I'll show
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
an or chart in a minute there's three
 
04:05:26.750 --> 04:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and 12 people so we're
 
04:05:31.710 --> 04:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:35.149 --> 04:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
pu all right next slide um there's been
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
some discussion about the differences
 
04:05:42.269 --> 04:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
between the Pu and a court and so I
 
04:05:43.630 --> 04:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
thought I I just put together a very
 
04:05:45.750 --> 04:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
brief slide on what are the differences
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
and what are people talking about when
 
04:05:50.189 --> 04:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
they talk about the PC versus the court
 
04:05:53.149 --> 04:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
so first the easy one the the courts are
 
04:05:55.630 --> 04:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
part of the judicial branch and the PC's
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
part of the Executive Branch the courts
 
04:05:59.790 --> 04:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
interpret the
 
04:06:03.550 --> 04:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
laws the PC enforces the public
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
utilities laws the courts have broad
 
04:06:09.990 --> 04:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the PC has narrow
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction just to the public
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
utilities the court have broad Equity
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
Powers the Pu has very narrow Equity
 
04:06:19.950 --> 04:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
powers and finally and probably the most
 
04:06:21.990 --> 04:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
important one is that typically the
 
04:06:23.950 --> 04:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
court has no interest in the outcome of
 
04:06:26.910 --> 04:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
civil litigation where the puc ACT is
 
04:06:29.149 --> 04:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
the Arbiter between the interest of the
 
04:06:30.870 --> 04:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
customer in the interests of the
 
04:06:33.630 --> 04:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
regulated utilities so that's really the
 
04:06:37.870 --> 04:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
difference uh between the two uh the two
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
entities and uh the other is also some
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
discussion on settlements um who should
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
be settlements who has you know who has
 
04:06:47.389 --> 04:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
the power in the settlements these kinds
 
04:06:49.229 --> 04:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
of things and so what we wanted to
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
highlight here is just that the courts
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
you a civil action are governed by
 
04:06:53.520 --> 04:06:54.670 align:start position:0%
you a civil action are governed by
contract

04:06:54.670 --> 04:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
contract
 
04:06:57.149 --> 04:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
law um the parties are free to settle
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
any case on any terms they choose and in
 
04:07:02.670 --> 04:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
the end the parties pay as a result of
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
process in the Public Utilities
 
04:07:07.950 --> 04:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
Commission a settlement is neither a
 
04:07:10.229 --> 04:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
contract nor governed by contract
 
04:07:12.950 --> 04:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
law instead it's stipulated findings of
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
fact in inclusions of law so we're doing
 
04:07:17.070 --> 04:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
something quite different than the court
 
04:07:19.269 --> 04:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
system again we're the Arbiter of the
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
interests of customers and the interest
 
04:07:22.510 --> 04:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
utilities we must thoroughly review each
 
04:07:26.950 --> 04:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
settlement to assess whether it's
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
consistent with the public
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
interest and uh our authority to approve
 
04:07:34.030 --> 04:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
or reject settlements is a necessary
 
04:07:37.710 --> 04:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
Safeguard against unwise or improper
 
04:07:39.630 --> 04:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
settlements and then finally right
 
04:07:41.469 --> 04:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
settlements really except but for the
 
04:07:43.710 --> 04:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
utilities use other people's money civil
 
04:07:45.229 --> 04:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
litigation it's just the two parties
 
04:07:47.870 --> 04:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
involved in the case of the Pu other
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
people's money is
 
04:07:52.510 --> 04:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
involved all right next slide is just a
 
04:07:55.790 --> 04:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
simple or chart for the commission we're
 
04:07:57.670 --> 04:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
a small entity organization there's just
 
04:08:00.109 --> 04:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners and then there's 12
 
04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
staff um and and the SEC administrator
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
per the uh change in the law last year
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
at the SEC administrator moved to the
 
04:08:09.429 --> 04:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
puc so that makes a total of
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
13 and on the next slide you'll see our
 
04:08:14.630 --> 04:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
operational forers so we tracked these
 
04:08:16.710 --> 04:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
metrics to see how we're doing there was
 
04:08:18.870 --> 04:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of criticism and it was justified
 
04:08:22.429 --> 04:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
of the Commission in 2021 and early 2022
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
that things were going into the
 
04:08:25.189 --> 04:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
commission but weren't coming out and
 
04:08:28.229 --> 04:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
that was true we only had a handful of
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
people there it was a new organization
 
04:08:31.630 --> 04:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
we were trying to get things up and
 
04:08:34.429 --> 04:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
running and so you can see the output in
 
04:08:36.630 --> 04:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
2022 as we caught up on decisional
 
04:08:39.790 --> 04:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
orders was 195 decisional orders that's
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
an alltime record in the PC for all the
 
04:08:44.189 --> 04:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
records that we have they go back maybe
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
20 or 25 years things have now steadied
 
04:08:48.790 --> 04:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
out we're outputting now about 165
 
04:08:50.269 --> 04:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
orders a
 
04:08:53.109 --> 04:08:53.119 align:start position:0%
year um the also on this chart you'll
 
04:08:55.229 --> 04:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
see orders of notice those are letting
 
04:08:57.429 --> 04:08:57.439 align:start position:0%
folks know that we have upcoming
 
04:08:59.670 --> 04:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
hearings procedural orders those are
 
04:09:02.070 --> 04:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
usually calendaring scheduling and so
 
04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
forth um old dockets closed we try to
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
keep track of are we on top of old
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
dockets are we processing things in a
 
04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
timely fashion and then finally the days
 
04:09:13.830 --> 04:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
from filing to acknowledgement letter
 
04:09:16.109 --> 04:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
are we getting back with people quickly
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
and efficiently so that everyone knows
 
04:09:21.830 --> 04:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
and is getting responded to so with that
 
04:09:24.349 --> 04:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
I'll pause uh before we move to
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner Delano I committed to give
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
a brief overview of 10 minutes so that's
 
04:09:32.469 --> 04:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
what I've tried to
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
do excellent thank you pass the
 
04:09:38.550 --> 04:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
microphone over to uh commissioner d
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
orano by the way it's nice to um meet
 
04:09:43.950 --> 04:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
you never met you here before nice to
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
meet you as B representative uh excuse
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
me uh so I am the newest commissioner uh
 
04:09:53.070 --> 04:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
on the commission uh on page 10 you'll
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
see a a very short bio about myself I
 
04:09:57.469 --> 04:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
put on there since uh we're all meeting
 
04:10:00.030 --> 04:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
each other for the first time uh I am
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
the uh attorney commissioner on the
 
04:10:05.070 --> 04:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
commission uh under statute uh you know
 
04:10:06.550 --> 04:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
one of the Commissioners must be an
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
attorney uh and that falls to me uh I
 
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
had uh previous to the commission worked
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
at the attorney General's office as an
 
04:10:16.510 --> 04:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General prior to that
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
I was uh at shenin and before that I was
 
04:10:22.790 --> 04:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
in uh industry as in-house
 
04:10:25.469 --> 04:10:25.479 align:start position:0%
Council next slide
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
please in the energy realm there are
 
04:10:30.830 --> 04:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
really two primary Regulators there are
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
the state and the federal government and
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
the federal government's regulation of
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
the El of electricity is really wrapped
 
04:10:40.990 --> 04:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
up in the interstate commerce clause to
 
04:10:43.910 --> 04:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
the Constitution as well as the what I
 
04:10:46.590 --> 04:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
like to call the uh most powerful law
 
04:10:48.109 --> 04:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
that no one's ever heard of the federal
 
04:10:51.070 --> 04:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
power act and so under the federal power
 
04:10:54.109 --> 04:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
act uh FK has jurisdiction furk is the
 
04:10:56.229 --> 04:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has
 
04:10:58.510 --> 04:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the use or sale of
 
04:11:00.269 --> 04:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
electric energy in interstate commerce
 
04:11:02.429 --> 04:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
applying to the transmission of electric
 
04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
energy in interstate commerce into the
 
04:11:06.870 --> 04:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
sale of electric energy at wholesale in
 
04:11:09.030 --> 04:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce the key to all of
 
04:11:11.910 --> 04:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
that being interstate commerce on the
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
other hand the states they regulate all
 
04:11:17.710 --> 04:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
of the intrastate Commerce in other
 
04:11:20.429 --> 04:11:20.439 align:start position:0%
words if you have a dis a distribution
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
utility and they're selling to local
 
04:11:26.109 --> 04:11:26.119 align:start position:0%
rate uh local rate payers or
 
04:11:28.389 --> 04:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
customers the state is responsible for
 
04:11:31.309 --> 04:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
the regulation of that aspect of the
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
transaction there is though an exception
 
04:11:36.269 --> 04:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
under federal law for rates that must be
 
04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable and if a state isn't
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
adequately making sure that that is
 
04:11:43.269 --> 04:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
happening then F can actually change
 
04:11:45.870 --> 04:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
change uh some State regulation but it
 
04:11:49.830 --> 04:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
does and the next page uh page 12 uh
 
04:11:56.550 --> 04:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
I've given some examples of some of the
 
04:11:59.469 --> 04:11:59.479 align:start position:0%
uh the jurisdiction that the commission
 
04:12:01.469 --> 04:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
has um I'm not going to read through the
 
04:12:04.510 --> 04:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
entire list but uh at towards the bottom
 
04:12:05.950 --> 04:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
of the second column you'll see rate
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
proceedings and tariff adjustments
 
04:12:10.590 --> 04:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
that's a a big part of what we do uh we
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
review integrated distribution plans uh
 
04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
we deal with the limited electrical
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
energy uh producers act uh and also net
 
04:12:21.790 --> 04:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
metering and as I said I won't uh bore
 
04:12:23.109 --> 04:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
you all with the
 
04:12:26.550 --> 04:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
list um turning to the next slide on
 
04:12:26.560 --> 04:12:27.550 align:start position:0%
list um turning to the next slide on
page

04:12:27.550 --> 04:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:12:30.070 --> 04:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
13 uh we just wanted to highlight for
 
04:12:32.309 --> 04:12:32.319 align:start position:0%
you folks what the New Hampshire energy
 
04:12:33.990 --> 04:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
policy currently is now this is what's
 
04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
in statute this is the policy that the
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
Pu um is required to follow uh and I
 
04:12:45.790 --> 04:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
won't read it for you now but um it it
 
04:12:50.469 --> 04:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
really tries to balance the needs of the
 
04:12:53.070 --> 04:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
rate base versus those of the regulated
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
utilities and in doing so the the
 
04:12:59.790 --> 04:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
legislator has decided that we need to
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
look at a uh you know diverse uh sources
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
of energy which uh in my mind is just a
 
04:13:09.990 --> 04:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
good thing anyway uh and other demands
 
04:13:11.710 --> 04:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
side resources to protect the safety and
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
health of the citizens uh the physical
 
04:13:16.389 --> 04:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
environment of the state and the future
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
supplies of resources so what does all
 
04:13:23.590 --> 04:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
that mean uh basically that means that
 
04:13:25.950 --> 04:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
energy needs to be delivered safely
 
04:13:29.590 --> 04:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
reliably and uh environmentally in an
 
04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
environmentally sensitive manner so uh
 
04:13:36.030 --> 04:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
some of those responsibilities are now
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh with the Department of energy but the
 
04:13:42.670 --> 04:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
Pu Pu needs to regulate the rates that
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
these utilities will uh seek in order to
 
04:13:47.950 --> 04:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
keep these systems up to keep those
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
resources safe reliable and uh to
 
04:13:54.030 --> 04:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.910 --> 04:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
environment uh the next page uh 14 uh
 
04:14:00.309 --> 04:14:00.319 align:start position:0%
commission jurisdiction protection of
 
04:14:04.910 --> 04:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
consumers so uh the the puc has a very
 
04:14:07.830 --> 04:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
important role in protecting um
 
04:14:10.990 --> 04:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
consumers from some of the uh Monopoly
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
powers that uh that that uh the public
 
04:14:18.750 --> 04:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
utilities have in other words uh there's
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
kind of What's called the regulatory
 
04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
compact where you have um a public
 
04:14:27.469 --> 04:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
utility that requires some kind of rate
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
of return on its money uh you have the
 
04:14:33.870 --> 04:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
ability under a monopoly uh situation
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
for a uh company like that to charge
 
04:14:38.349 --> 04:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
whatever they want for their products
 
04:14:41.590 --> 04:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
are the only supplier of it as part of
 
04:14:44.510 --> 04:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
the regulatory compact
 
04:14:47.349 --> 04:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
the state through its
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
pu balances the interests of the rate
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
payer in paying the lowest rate possible
 
04:14:57.070 --> 04:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
with the interests of the uh regulated
 
04:15:00.910 --> 04:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
Monopoly in ensuring that one it makes a
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable rate of return on its assets
 
04:15:07.710 --> 04:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
and uh secondly that uh the capital
 
04:15:09.630 --> 04:15:09.640 align:start position:0%
structure that is ultimately approved by
 
04:15:11.910 --> 04:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
the the Public Utilities Commission will
 
04:15:13.950 --> 04:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
allow that regulated utility to continue
 
04:15:16.710 --> 04:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
to operate that's a very important point
 
04:15:18.750 --> 04:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
that a lot of folks Miss in utility
 
04:15:20.590 --> 04:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
regulation that you know at the end of
 
04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
the day uh we're a cap on uh their
 
04:15:27.070 --> 04:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
spending and on their return but we also
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
ensure a floor so that that way they can
 
04:15:35.790 --> 04:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.389 --> 04:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
operate uh next page uh page 15 uh I
 
04:15:40.790 --> 04:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you guys a bit of an
 
04:15:42.590 --> 04:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
example of what a commission proceeding
 
04:15:45.910 --> 04:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
looks like like so uh this is uh almost
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
a this is my uh depiction of what our
 
04:15:50.510 --> 04:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
hearing room looks like at the
 
04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
Pu uh on one side we have the public
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
utility and they generally bring the
 
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
most people and so they're depicted in
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
Blue on the other side uh we have the
 
04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy depicted in yellow
 
04:16:04.630 --> 04:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer Advocate
 
04:16:08.189 --> 04:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
depicted in green and uh what we're
 
04:16:09.950 --> 04:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
calling interveners but the
 
04:16:13.990 --> 04:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
traditionally stakeholders in uh utility
 
04:16:17.469 --> 04:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
regulation uh depicted in purple and so
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'm next I'm going to go through some of
 
04:16:20.269 --> 04:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
the roles that all of the that these
 
04:16:23.910 --> 04:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
parties play in uh you know in these
 
04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
functions uh we're going to skip slide
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
16 because this is more of something I
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
provided for all of you it's almost a
 
04:16:32.830 --> 04:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
cheat sheet to how to read one of our uh
 
04:16:34.590 --> 04:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
dockets um you know what the numbers
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
mean and some examples of of cases that
 
04:16:39.469 --> 04:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
fall under those kinds of dockets so if
 
04:16:44.950 --> 04:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
the Pu basically has two types of
 
04:16:49.349 --> 04:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
proceedings before one of them one type
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
is adjudicative proceedings uh those are
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings that are almost like a mini
 
04:16:56.030 --> 04:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
trial at the administrative
 
04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
level and we have non- adjudicative
 
04:17:01.990 --> 04:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
processes which are and this is actually
 
04:17:04.429 --> 04:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
shown on page 18 the next slide and
 
04:17:06.149 --> 04:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
nonadjudicated processes which
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
essentially Encompass just about
 
04:17:10.269 --> 04:17:10.279 align:start position:0%
everything else now the kinds of matters
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
that we hear in adjudicative proceedings
 
04:17:14.830 --> 04:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
are generally things like rate cases uh
 
04:17:17.229 --> 04:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
utility financing uh Alternative forms
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
of Regulation uh but it also can include
 
04:17:21.469 --> 04:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
things like procurement of renewable
 
04:17:21.479 --> 04:17:22.469 align:start position:0%
things like procurement of renewable
natural

04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
natural
 
04:17:26.429 --> 04:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
gas whereas administr non- adjudicative
 
04:17:29.109 --> 04:17:29.119 align:start position:0%
processes they include things like uh
 
04:17:31.469 --> 04:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
review of uh you know Community Power
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
electric aggregation plan so these are
 
04:17:35.630 --> 04:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
plans that the town's put together for
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
aggregation and they are reviewed and
 
04:17:40.349 --> 04:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
approved by the Public Utilities
 
04:17:42.990 --> 04:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
Commission this doesn't generally end up
 
04:17:44.670 --> 04:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
in some kind of contested matter
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
although if there was interest in a cont
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
in this turning into a contested case
 
04:17:51.990 --> 04:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
the Pu could if it felt that it was in
 
04:17:53.910 --> 04:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
the interest of the public convert this
 
04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
into an utive proceeding but so far the
 
04:17:58.790 --> 04:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
puc hasn't had anything like that uh
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
also we do investigation of Interstate
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
rates through non- adjudicative process
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
we do our rul making and uh declaratory
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
rulings declaratory rulings are
 
04:18:10.269 --> 04:18:10.279 align:start position:0%
generally requests from folks that are
 
04:18:13.389 --> 04:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
regulated by a state agency looking to
 
04:18:16.149 --> 04:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
see how a rule or statute might apply to
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
them so that isn't unlike a declaratory
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
judgment in court where there would be
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
two sides here this is generally someone
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
coming and asking the commission uh you
 
04:18:27.269 --> 04:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
know what how they think this rule might
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
apply to them and the commission will
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
come out with a ruling uh the attorney
 
04:18:33.189 --> 04:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office is usually
 
04:18:35.990 --> 04:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
involved with that as well so um it's
 
04:18:37.910 --> 04:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
not something that the commission will
 
04:18:40.109 --> 04:18:40.119 align:start position:0%
make on its own it'll generally ask the
 
04:18:42.070 --> 04:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office for an opinion
 
04:18:45.269 --> 04:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
on the matter and take that opinion and
 
04:18:46.990 --> 04:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh weigh it against the statutory
 
04:18:49.229 --> 04:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
obligations commission
 
04:18:51.910 --> 04:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
has we turn to the next page 19
 
04:18:54.590 --> 04:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
commission is Arbiter uh chair goldner
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
uh started speaking a bit about this
 
04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
unlike a court uh the commission is
 
04:19:01.269 --> 04:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
really the Arbiter between the interests
 
04:19:02.590 --> 04:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
of the consumer and the interest of the
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
regulated utility this isn't just
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
something that we say this is actually
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh in statute uh it's been in statute
 
04:19:13.950 --> 04:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
since I want to say uh at the earliest
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
the late
 
04:19:18.429 --> 04:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
1960s uh and hasn't changed very much uh
 
04:19:18.439 --> 04:19:22.429 align:start position:0%
1960s uh and hasn't changed very much uh
since

04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:26.269 --> 04:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
then turn to the next page uh I've
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
highlighted some statements from the
 
04:19:30.990 --> 04:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and from our statutes uh
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
regarding that position of arbiter so uh
 
04:19:38.469 --> 04:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
in appeal of pin Tre power uh the state
 
04:19:40.670 --> 04:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
supreme court decided that in
 
04:19:43.149 --> 04:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
determining rates the Pu isbd between
 
04:19:44.910 --> 04:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
the interests of the customer and the
 
04:19:46.590 --> 04:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
interests of the regulated
 
04:19:48.990 --> 04:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
utility uh when considering whether to
 
04:19:51.030 --> 04:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
allow a regulated utility to recover
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
electric distribution system investment
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
costs from rate payers the commission
 
04:19:56.109 --> 04:19:56.119 align:start position:0%
must first determine whether those
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
Investments were prudently incurred this
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
is where we get into the used and useful
 
04:20:03.389 --> 04:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
analysis that the commission goes
 
04:20:06.550 --> 04:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
through uh when it's adjudicating rate
 
04:20:08.790 --> 04:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
cases uh in determining whether rates
 
04:20:10.349 --> 04:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
are adjusted reasonable commission must
 
04:20:11.550 --> 04:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
balance the customer's interest in
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
paying no higher rates
 
04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh than are required against the
 
04:20:16.630 --> 04:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
Investor's interest in obtaining a
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable rate of return on their
 
04:20:20.710 --> 04:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
Investments this is uh again something
 
04:20:22.389 --> 04:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
that we discussed or at least I
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
discussed a little bit earlier uh and
 
04:20:27.109 --> 04:20:27.119 align:start position:0%
then lastly uh the Pu must not only
 
04:20:29.469 --> 04:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
perform duties statutorily created but
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
also exercise those powers inherent with
 
04:20:35.469 --> 04:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
it within its broad Grant of power so
 
04:20:37.429 --> 04:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
unlike most state agencies and most
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceedings the uh one one
 
04:20:43.469 --> 04:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
example of this is that uh the uh Public
 
04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission can reopen an old
 
04:20:47.950 --> 04:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
order with notice and provide for due
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
process and reexamine that order if
 
04:20:52.389 --> 04:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
things have changed in the future most
 
04:20:54.750 --> 04:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
administrative agencies in fact I can't
 
04:20:56.790 --> 04:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
think of one that has that exact same
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
power but the puc has that power in
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that rates are just
 
04:21:04.030 --> 04:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:07.630 --> 04:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
interest uh we turn next page please 21
 
04:21:10.349 --> 04:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
uh commission as investigator uh so
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
without going through both of these here
 
04:21:16.510 --> 04:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh the commission has a limited role as
 
04:21:19.590 --> 04:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
an investigator in other words uh it has
 
04:21:22.349 --> 04:21:22.359 align:start position:0%
a legal responsibility uh you know to
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh you know before
 
04:21:27.229 --> 04:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
holding a hearing that it investigates
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
the uh matters that will be uh before it
 
04:21:34.149 --> 04:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
during the hearing and um if they rely
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
on facts that uh came from that
 
04:21:38.269 --> 04:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
investigation that they're included in
 
04:21:40.870 --> 04:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
the hearing record and included uh in
 
04:21:42.950 --> 04:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
the order if those were used as part of
 
04:21:42.960 --> 04:21:43.790 align:start position:0%
the order if those were used as part of
that

04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:47.070 --> 04:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
decision uh in terms of rate increases
 
04:21:50.750 --> 04:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh the Pu has uh investigatory Authority
 
04:21:53.830 --> 04:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
there as well uh and this is again to
 
04:21:56.309 --> 04:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that rates are just reasonable
 
04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:03.910 --> 04:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
interest turn to the next page uh we're
 
04:22:06.389 --> 04:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
now turning to our uh public utility our
 
04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
group of uh blue tables uh what is a
 
04:22:11.550 --> 04:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
public utility I won't uh read the
 
04:22:14.590 --> 04:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
definition but I provided it there for
 
04:22:17.429 --> 04:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
folks um so that they understand you
 
04:22:19.429 --> 04:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
know what is what is a public utility
 
04:22:21.389 --> 04:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
and the kinds of businesses that have to
 
04:22:26.429 --> 04:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
Pu uh turning to the next page page 23
 
04:22:34.990 --> 04:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
again with blue tables uh I've included
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of different types of
 
04:22:40.630 --> 04:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
proceedings so we have rate increases um
 
04:22:42.630 --> 04:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
that a public utility May file with
 
04:22:44.149 --> 04:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
their schedules when they open up a new
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
rate case and we also talk a little bit
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
about the burden that the public utility
 
04:22:52.910 --> 04:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
must meet in order to uh to have a rate
 
04:22:56.229 --> 04:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
increase uh and so you know this this
 
04:22:59.389 --> 04:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
process is is is very clearly delineated
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
in statute so uh there's never an
 
04:23:04.630 --> 04:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the Pu to just kind of
 
04:23:07.710 --> 04:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
make it up it this is all things that uh
 
04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature has established and uh
 
04:23:14.070 --> 04:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
processes that we follow based on those
 
04:23:16.750 --> 04:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
established uh statutory
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
Provisions uh turning to the next page I
 
04:23:20.950 --> 04:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
also provideed an example of uh
 
04:23:23.710 --> 04:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
franchise expansions these are when uh a
 
04:23:26.550 --> 04:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
public utility wants to either uh expand
 
04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
into a new business or increase its uh
 
04:23:32.189 --> 04:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
service territory uh it can also be when
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
new entrants want to come into uh New
 
04:23:38.189 --> 04:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh be a uh public utility
 
04:23:40.269 --> 04:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
uh and again uh you know there's a
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
statutory burden of proof on uh what
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
these utilities must substantiate in
 
04:23:48.030 --> 04:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
order for the Pu to issue an order
 
04:23:53.189 --> 04:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:55.469 --> 04:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
franchise these get a lot shorter pretty
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
soon here so uh next page is 25 uh
 
04:24:00.950 --> 04:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about the department
 
04:24:03.750 --> 04:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
of Energy's role uh in our proceedings
 
04:24:04.990 --> 04:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh the department of energy is an
 
04:24:07.309 --> 04:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
automatic party to all commission
 
04:24:09.510 --> 04:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
proceedings uh it also has the authority
 
04:24:11.309 --> 04:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
to petition for any proceeding before
 
04:24:13.630 --> 04:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
the public utilties commission so what
 
04:24:17.309 --> 04:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
this means is that any of the uh list of
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
areas that uh we talked a little bit
 
04:24:22.349 --> 04:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
about earlier on the two columns uh in
 
04:24:24.710 --> 04:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
some instances uh the department of
 
04:24:26.830 --> 04:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
energy can petition and affirm
 
04:24:28.830 --> 04:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
affirmatively bring something forward to
 
04:24:30.910 --> 04:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission to
 
04:24:33.710 --> 04:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
consider um while before the Public
 
04:24:35.870 --> 04:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission uh the department
 
04:24:38.469 --> 04:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
represents the Department's position in
 
04:24:38.479 --> 04:24:39.750 align:start position:0%
represents the Department's position in
commission

04:24:39.750 --> 04:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:24:41.790 --> 04:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
proceedings uh it has the authority to
 
04:24:43.830 --> 04:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
investigate any matter that may come
 
04:24:45.149 --> 04:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
before the
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
commission and lastly uh it must provide
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
all necessary administrative Technical
 
04:24:51.990 --> 04:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
and staff support the commission to
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
assist the Commission in carrying out
 
04:24:55.309 --> 04:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
its Regulatory and adjudicative
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
functions so uh the when the puc had 70
 
04:25:02.990 --> 04:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
employees as you can imagine uh it had a
 
04:25:05.910 --> 04:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
lot more support than it does under a
 
04:25:09.109 --> 04:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
scheme where there's 13 employees and so
 
04:25:10.870 --> 04:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh when the legislature made the
 
04:25:13.189 --> 04:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
decision to split doe away from uh the
 
04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission left this
 
04:25:17.630 --> 04:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
caveat or or this requirement in the law
 
04:25:20.070 --> 04:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
so that uh uh you know we're we're not
 
04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh left up a creek without a paddle so
 
04:25:25.349 --> 04:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
to speak and we can uh both receive at
 
04:25:27.510 --> 04:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
hearings information from uh the
 
04:25:29.710 --> 04:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
department of energy but also outside of
 
04:25:31.830 --> 04:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
hearings they also manage our business
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
office it's actually their business
 
04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
office that we use as an
 
04:25:38.269 --> 04:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
agency uh turning to the next page uh I
 
04:25:43.830 --> 04:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about the consumer
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh in New Hampshire our
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate is the consumer
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
advocate for residential rate payers uh
 
04:25:52.950 --> 04:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
and he has a pretty important job in
 
04:25:55.590 --> 04:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
that role um you know they he is
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to uh uh petition or initiate
 
04:26:02.910 --> 04:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
for initiate proceedings before the
 
04:26:05.109 --> 04:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission regarding
 
04:26:07.389 --> 04:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
matters that involve uh rate payer
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
interests and again I by that I mean
 
04:26:13.229 --> 04:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
residential rate payer interests um and
 
04:26:15.790 --> 04:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
uh the second point on that page States
 
04:26:17.309 --> 04:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
his St has standing to intervene in
 
04:26:18.590 --> 04:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
commission proceedings only when the
 
04:26:19.910 --> 04:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
interests of residential utility
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
customers are presently involved uh and
 
04:26:24.630 --> 04:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's something that came from
 
04:26:26.189 --> 04:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
uh the Supreme Court essentially what
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
that means is that if we're having a
 
04:26:30.510 --> 04:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
rate case that's only commercial rates
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh or rate distribution rates for
 
04:26:33.950 --> 04:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
commercial clients uh or commercial
 
04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
customers uh of a utility then uh the
 
04:26:39.070 --> 04:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate doesn't have a role in
 
04:26:41.870 --> 04:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
that uh kind of proceeding because those
 
04:26:46.349 --> 04:26:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:51.269 --> 04:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
payers uh moving on to uh page 27 uh are
 
04:26:53.149 --> 04:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
interveners uh those interveners can
 
04:26:55.469 --> 04:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
include among others uh customers
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
investors in investor owned utilities
 
04:27:00.790 --> 04:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
industry groups uh uh clean energy New
 
04:27:02.950 --> 04:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire comes to mind immediately uh
 
04:27:06.189 --> 04:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
non-governmental organizations similar
 
04:27:08.510 --> 04:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire subdivisions towns
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
counties uh other state
 
04:27:13.149 --> 04:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
agencies uh independent power producers
 
04:27:15.030 --> 04:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
independent energy suppliers and any
 
04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
other person with an interest in a
 
04:27:19.109 --> 04:27:19.119 align:start position:0%
pending case uh prospective interveners
 
04:27:20.590 --> 04:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
must uh petition the commission to
 
04:27:21.950 --> 04:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
intervene in a commission proceeding
 
04:27:23.349 --> 04:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
meaning that you know they're not
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
automatic parties uh and that uh in most
 
04:27:29.790 --> 04:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
cases they're not even mandatory parties
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
they're what's called a permissive party
 
04:27:34.510 --> 04:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
so if they can articulate a an interest
 
04:27:36.990 --> 04:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
that should be heard before the Public
 
04:27:38.429 --> 04:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission the Public
 
04:27:39.790 --> 04:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission will grant
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
intervention to those folks
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh and the commission may impose
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
conditions upon uh interveners
 
04:27:47.469 --> 04:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
participation in the proceedings either
 
04:27:50.189 --> 04:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
at the time of intervention or at any
 
04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
subsequent time uh and so a lot of times
 
04:27:54.750 --> 04:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh although I haven't seen it with the
 
04:27:57.109 --> 04:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
current commission uh past commissions
 
04:27:59.590 --> 04:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
have put uh you know relatively
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable restrictions on um large
 
04:28:04.030 --> 04:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
groups of interveners for instance
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
they've got to get get together and do
 
04:28:07.910 --> 04:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
Discovery together or they have to get
 
04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
together and and uh present a position
 
04:28:12.750 --> 04:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
together uh again that isn't something
 
04:28:17.309 --> 04:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
done that wraps up my
 
04:28:23.309 --> 04:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
section okay please pass the microphone
 
04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
over to commissioner
 
04:28:30.109 --> 04:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
chat so good afternoon um just a quick
 
04:28:32.389 --> 04:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
background I have a PhD in
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
economics and um I've been
 
04:28:39.109 --> 04:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
doing uh utility
 
04:28:43.870 --> 04:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:48.070 --> 04:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
1999 and um initially I was um you know
 
04:28:49.750 --> 04:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
I got my PhD from University of
 
04:28:51.790 --> 04:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
Washington Seattle and I went back to
 
04:28:53.950 --> 04:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
India worked as a consultant and then
 
04:28:55.710 --> 04:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
moved to a electricity Regulatory
 
04:28:59.469 --> 04:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
Commission as their uh their only
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
Economist okay um I have
 
04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
also um I was the assistant consumer
 
04:29:10.710 --> 04:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
Advocate I think beginning sorry um yeah
 
04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes beginning 2015 through all the
 
04:29:17.830 --> 04:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
way to 2021 when I joined the
 
04:29:17.840 --> 04:29:21.189 align:start position:0%
way to 2021 when I joined the
commission

04:29:21.189 --> 04:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:25.189 --> 04:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
um uh of late I'm also um involved in
 
04:29:28.510 --> 04:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
Regional electric matters and I was uh
 
04:29:33.189 --> 04:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
selected by uh nuk to represent uh the
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
New England interest um so there were
 
04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
two Commissioners that were chosen in
 
04:29:41.590 --> 04:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
this Pan national effort to look at how
 
04:29:45.469 --> 04:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
we can improve um the interplay between
 
04:29:48.469 --> 04:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
different states uh impacting
 
04:29:50.790 --> 04:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
transmission gas electric coordination
 
04:29:53.229 --> 04:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
all of that so that is a FK States
 
04:29:56.710 --> 04:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
collaboration and I'm part of it um so
 
04:29:59.309 --> 04:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to now dive into the the
 
04:30:02.469 --> 04:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
slides um as should be apparent from the
 
04:30:07.389 --> 04:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
previous um discussions it's um we have
 
04:30:10.750 --> 04:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
a a significant role in setting rates
 
04:30:14.109 --> 04:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
and the goal for us to do it do that in
 
04:30:16.070 --> 04:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
a just and reasonable manner that's
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's the main focus and um much of the
 
04:30:24.349 --> 04:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
um the most important dockets usually
 
04:30:26.830 --> 04:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
tend to be the rate cases so right now
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
we have couple of rate cases
 
04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
ongoing um though I I cannot talk about
 
04:30:36.070 --> 04:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
them um but they take up a lot of of our
 
04:30:38.309 --> 04:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
our time in understanding what is being
 
04:30:40.830 --> 04:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
proposed and you know again meeting our
 
04:30:45.070 --> 04:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.349 --> 04:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
um the other types of rates are also
 
04:30:51.990 --> 04:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
very important so if you go to the next
 
04:30:56.070 --> 04:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
slide um I've mentioned some of the
 
04:31:01.149 --> 04:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
rates that we look at and um I'd like
 
04:31:06.070 --> 04:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
to stress that given the change in the
 
04:31:07.950 --> 04:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
competitive environment you have now
 
04:31:11.229 --> 04:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
Community power you have a lot more uh
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
competitive ener energy Supply the
 
04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
default service rate has taken greater
 
04:31:18.229 --> 04:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
importance and been starting we've
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
started taking a look at it um so it's
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
not merely restricting the Monopoly
 
04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
power of the regulated utilities it's
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
also looking at um fostering a
 
04:31:34.189 --> 04:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
competitive environment and that
 
04:31:36.349 --> 04:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
requires that we look at what's going on
 
04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
in other rates and and and we have been
 
04:31:43.109 --> 04:31:43.119 align:start position:0%
um uh guiding the default rates in a
 
04:31:46.269 --> 04:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
particular manner off late and I'm going
 
04:31:50.309 --> 04:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
a so for a reference if if if folks want
 
04:32:04.750 --> 04:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
to take a look at a particular utility
 
04:32:06.269 --> 04:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
you can go back and look at what's going
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
on in docket D 23043 and docket de 2446
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
um so for for example for February 20125
 
04:32:21.710 --> 04:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
to July
 
04:32:23.910 --> 04:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
2025 the commission has directed
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
eversource for example to self procure
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
30% of its expected residential load so
 
04:32:32.429 --> 04:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
what's what the commission has done
 
04:32:34.510 --> 04:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
we've started looking at data and we've
 
04:32:38.550 --> 04:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
come to the realization that the U the
 
04:32:42.070 --> 04:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
100% purchase of power from other third
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
party suppliers tags on a big um premium
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
okay with the the rate pays have been
 
04:32:54.910 --> 04:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
paying and it tends to be that looking
 
04:32:56.910 --> 04:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
at historical data that they pay a lot
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
more than what they would if they were
 
04:33:01.910 --> 04:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
at least partly buying on their own
 
04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
directly talking about utilities um
 
04:33:06.750 --> 04:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the markets at any point in
 
04:33:09.551 --> 04:33:09.561 align:start position:0%
time and and purchasing power that would
 
04:33:10.830 --> 04:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
that would save a lot of money for
 
04:33:13.230 --> 04:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
residential customers
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
um you go to slide don't see the number
 
04:33:20.390 --> 04:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
sorry um this
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
one that's slide
 
04:33:31.789 --> 04:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
3 32 slide 32 I'm I'm trying to um oh
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
you're there okay yeah so um I just
 
04:33:36.590 --> 04:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight
 
04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
here that um I looked at the data and
 
04:33:45.789 --> 04:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
the markups between what the Wholesale
 
04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
Electric market prices turn out to be as
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to what the rates tend to be in
 
04:33:55.629 --> 04:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
the um the um default service they the
 
04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
markups are given here for the different
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
months August 23 to November 24 of
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
course when you have very high energy
 
04:34:06.349 --> 04:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
prices you'll see the markups are really
 
04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
high and when when the um uh Energy
 
04:34:12.109 --> 04:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
prices are low the markups are not that
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
high but they're still pretty
 
04:34:16.670 --> 04:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
substantial so for example in November
 
04:34:18.990 --> 04:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
20 2024 the number is
 
04:34:24.429 --> 04:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
60 3% and so it's still pretty high so
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
um and so that's that's the message that
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
I wanted to capture here even though you
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
can also infer that over time with the
 
04:34:36.949 --> 04:34:36.959 align:start position:0%
move from 100% procurement from third
 
04:34:39.789 --> 04:34:39.799 align:start position:0%
party to partly
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
self-supply right now ever s has 12 1
 
04:34:45.269 --> 04:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
12% of its energy needs being met
 
04:34:49.029 --> 04:34:49.039 align:start position:0%
through self-supply so if they do that
 
04:34:52.029 --> 04:34:52.039 align:start position:0%
that also probably impacted this trend
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
so you see here but it's not as clear as
 
04:34:59.349 --> 04:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
what would appear in the next slide Mr
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr
 
04:35:06.349 --> 04:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
chairman I I know we usually wait for
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
questions but I just wondered if at this
 
04:35:10.590 --> 04:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
moment we could ask the commissioner to
 
04:35:13.629 --> 04:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
explain what self Supply is I don't I'm
 
04:35:15.709 --> 04:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
certainly not familiar certainly sure
 
04:35:17.629 --> 04:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so the
 
04:35:22.150 --> 04:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
utility not running an RFP so for
 
04:35:24.269 --> 04:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
example if they want to procure energy
 
04:35:24.279 --> 04:35:25.789 align:start position:0%
example if they want to procure energy
in

04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:35:29.070 --> 04:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
February they will buy energy based on
 
04:35:31.949 --> 04:35:31.959 align:start position:0%
the spot market prices or whatever the
 
04:35:34.349 --> 04:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
real prices are at that time so that's
 
04:35:36.390 --> 04:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
self-supply they're
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
not SP but I hesitate to use that term
 
04:35:42.349 --> 04:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
strictly because there are other
 
04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
elements to
 
04:35:50.310 --> 04:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
it um so going to slide number
 
04:35:55.029 --> 04:35:55.039 align:start position:0%
33 you will notice that since
 
04:35:55.039 --> 04:35:56.910 align:start position:0%
33 you will notice that since
July

04:35:56.910 --> 04:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
July
 
04:35:56.920 --> 04:35:59.551 align:start position:0%
July
um

04:35:59.551 --> 04:35:59.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:03.269 --> 04:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
2023 when the rate pairs residential
 
04:36:05.470 --> 04:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
rate pairs in New in New Hampshire paid
 
04:36:09.390 --> 04:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
the highest price relative to the other
 
04:36:12.429 --> 04:36:12.439 align:start position:0%
um you know other states
 
04:36:12.439 --> 04:36:13.551 align:start position:0%
um you know other states
their

04:36:13.551 --> 04:36:13.561 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:36:15.551 --> 04:36:15.561 align:start position:0%
prices in
 
04:36:15.561 --> 04:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
prices in
October

04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
October
 
04:36:22.349 --> 04:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
2024 was the lowest among the divested
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
States okay so that's the red line if
 
04:36:28.629 --> 04:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
you look at it was at the highest in
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
July 2023 and it's lowest except for
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont in October
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
2024 so why am I pointing out except
 
04:36:41.670 --> 04:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont because Vermont isn't the divest
 
04:36:43.949 --> 04:36:43.959 align:start position:0%
state so they have it's they're not in
 
04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
in the markets like the other states
 
04:36:51.590 --> 04:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
are so that tells me that this move
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
towards bidin Cod self Supply is
 
04:36:59.189 --> 04:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
helping and um
 
04:37:03.510 --> 04:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
if based on what is expected in the
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
early part of
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
2025 I would expect the electric rates
 
04:37:17.551 --> 04:37:17.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative McGee would like to
 
04:37:21.349 --> 04:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
interrupt with a question thank you uh
 
04:37:23.551 --> 04:37:23.561 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr commissioner for taking my
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
question so are we to assume that that's
 
04:37:26.760 --> 04:37:27.470 align:start position:0%
question so are we to assume that that's
the

04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:30.269 --> 04:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
only input to lowering those prices
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
because I know we've increased
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
competition in that same period of time
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
with Community power driving prices down
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
as well right some competition in the
 
04:37:40.510 --> 04:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
market that is correct so that's why um
 
04:37:43.109 --> 04:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
even for the previous slides even though
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
you see a trend we cannot be 100% sure
 
04:37:50.551 --> 04:37:50.561 align:start position:0%
it's just about one specific input and
 
04:37:55.990 --> 04:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
likewise for this graph yes but I'm just
 
04:37:58.230 --> 04:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
saying you know this this is a
 
04:38:00.109 --> 04:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
significant change from what happened in
 
04:38:04.470 --> 04:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
July 2023 to October and part of it is
 
04:38:06.949 --> 04:38:06.959 align:start position:0%
maybe we are already seeing some
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
please Ju Just to further um add on to
 
04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
commissioner trap's comments we what we
 
04:38:25.150 --> 04:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
know is that in the last cycle the
 
04:38:26.590 --> 04:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
wholesale price with all of the
 
04:38:28.470 --> 04:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
additions and everything added in was
 
04:38:31.109 --> 04:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
about $65 a megawatt hour for
 
04:38:34.269 --> 04:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
Supply the uh distribution
 
04:38:36.510 --> 04:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
utilities are sellings to the market
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
price beginning February 1st varies
 
04:38:42.590 --> 04:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
between $83 a megawatt hour and $89 a
 
04:38:47.629 --> 04:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour and had we gone um to the
 
04:38:51.310 --> 04:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
the old process had we just um had we
 
04:38:52.510 --> 04:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
just gone through the third party
 
04:38:54.310 --> 04:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
bidding process the price would have
 
04:38:57.150 --> 04:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
been about $100 a megawatt hour so we we
 
04:38:59.869 --> 04:38:59.879 align:start position:0%
we know we know what's uh happening as
 
04:39:03.029 --> 04:39:03.039 align:start position:0%
we go and uh if we were able to get to
 
04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
the 100% wholesale price it would be
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
so to the point
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
about other things happening in the
 
04:39:21.949 --> 04:39:21.959 align:start position:0%
market in terms of competition the last
 
04:39:25.150 --> 04:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
um point in
 
04:39:27.990 --> 04:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
slide 3
 
04:39:31.029 --> 04:39:31.039 align:start position:0%
34 it's the the great this is important
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
as in for for for an economist so
 
04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
greater Reliance on self Supply
 
04:39:37.948 --> 04:39:37.958 align:start position:0%
potentially also supports greater retail
 
04:39:40.190 --> 04:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
competition between competitive energy
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
suppliers community power aggregators
 
04:39:45.788 --> 04:39:45.798 align:start position:0%
and utilities with pricing signals Sands
 
04:39:50.910 --> 04:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:53.110 --> 04:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
premiums slide
 
04:39:55.868 --> 04:39:55.878 align:start position:0%
35 um I'll just quickly go over like
 
04:39:58.590 --> 04:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
there are other mechanism that can help
 
04:40:01.830 --> 04:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
lead to a more competitive outcome and
 
04:40:03.708 --> 04:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
view you know this I I won't go over
 
04:40:08.270 --> 04:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
them um Point by point but uh the
 
04:40:10.390 --> 04:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
important thing here is that there is
 
04:40:12.510 --> 04:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
also a linkage between between what do
 
04:40:14.590 --> 04:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
you see in the retail markets and what
 
04:40:16.750 --> 04:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
do you see in wholesale markets and you
 
04:40:20.470 --> 04:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to better link the retail
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
markets with the wholesale markets to
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:28.798 --> 04:40:32.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:35.430 --> 04:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
and so now I'm going to slightly change
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
the discussion a bit this is more about
 
04:40:41.070 --> 04:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
our role in the regional uh landscape
 
04:40:43.670 --> 04:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay okay so slide number
 
04:40:46.628 --> 04:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
36 shows how in the US you have
 
04:40:46.638 --> 04:40:47.430 align:start position:0%
36 shows how in the US you have
different

04:40:47.430 --> 04:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:40:52.030 --> 04:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
Ros and New Hampshire is part of the iso
 
04:40:55.150 --> 04:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
New England RTO
 
04:40:58.510 --> 04:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
okay and it it based on the statute it
 
04:41:01.230 --> 04:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
is up to us to represent the interest of
 
04:41:05.670 --> 04:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rirs uh customers um it's
 
04:41:07.948 --> 04:41:07.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's in the statute so it's
 
04:41:11.628 --> 04:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
it's we have a role in ensuring that
 
04:41:14.270 --> 04:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
first of all the policies that are there
 
04:41:16.750 --> 04:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
in the in in the state policies are
 
04:41:20.190 --> 04:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
being consistently adad to um when we
 
04:41:22.708 --> 04:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
participate in Regional activities and
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
number two it's as as an economist it's
 
04:41:29.350 --> 04:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
really about uh getting the benefits of
 
04:41:32.350 --> 04:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
competition that's that's what drives my
 
04:41:34.470 --> 04:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
way of looking at
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
things so quickly um there are two major
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
players in the regional uh Arena it's
 
04:41:43.628 --> 04:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
obviously for us it's the iso New
 
04:41:47.670 --> 04:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
England and it's FK ISO New England is
 
04:41:51.190 --> 04:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh answerable to FK so those are the two
 
04:41:53.830 --> 04:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
major entities but there are other
 
04:41:56.510 --> 04:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
entities that we get involved in so that
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
we can impress upon ISO New England or F
 
04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
what is right for us and those
 
04:42:11.390 --> 04:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
um Regional bodies are represented in
 
04:42:16.628 --> 04:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
um page 39 okay so there are three
 
04:42:20.150 --> 04:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
major um players one of them is necar
 
04:42:22.070 --> 04:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the Commissioners are part of
 
04:42:25.470 --> 04:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
it the second is Nesco they get involved
 
04:42:27.390 --> 04:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
in knee poool matters before ISO New
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
England so they um for different
 
04:42:36.948 --> 04:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
comedies in in neol have representation
 
04:42:39.628 --> 04:42:39.638 align:start position:0%
from Nesco and I'm not talking about
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
voting rights I'm just saying they're
 
04:42:43.190 --> 04:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
present there to let them know what the
 
04:42:43.200 --> 04:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
present there to let them know what the
states

04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:42:48.670 --> 04:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
think and lastly nuk which is a National
 
04:42:51.868 --> 04:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
Organization um of the regulated utility
 
04:42:54.190 --> 04:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners there too we have a role
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
and so the initially when I was
 
04:42:59.230 --> 04:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
introducing myself I talked about U this
 
04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
collaboration between FK and states that
 
04:43:13.788 --> 04:43:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:16.628 --> 04:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
so again going back to the so if you go
 
04:43:18.830 --> 04:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
back to go to slide 40 I'm stressing the
 
04:43:21.390 --> 04:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
importance of linking retail competition
 
04:43:24.190 --> 04:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
with wholesale competition so I
 
04:43:29.670 --> 04:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
personally believe that um there is a
 
04:43:29.680 --> 04:43:32.030 align:start position:0%
personally believe that um there is a
role

04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
role
 
04:43:37.110 --> 04:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
for us in improving participant
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
participation by end customers here
 
04:43:46.230 --> 04:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
in the state um in wholesale Market
 
04:43:48.670 --> 04:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
activities so that they can also benefit
 
04:43:52.750 --> 04:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
from It generally what happens is the
 
04:43:55.030 --> 04:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
Wholesale Electric markets given ISO New
 
04:43:57.510 --> 04:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
England's focus on transmission and
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
other things they tend to uh be more
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
Guided by you know how they can get
 
04:44:08.788 --> 04:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
supply cheaply but so it that thrust
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
kind of misses the point that even rate
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
pairs at the as end end users retail
 
04:44:18.788 --> 04:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
customers can benefit from the wholesale
 
04:44:20.628 --> 04:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
markets directly by participating
 
04:44:24.628 --> 04:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
through um demand response so that is
 
04:44:27.230 --> 04:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
something that I'm also part of there's
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
a working group that I'm participating
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
in so I wanted to hurry a little bit
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
because of the time constraints thank
 
04:44:38.350 --> 04:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
you well thank you uh to the three of
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
you I have to say I've sat through quite
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
a few quite a number of
 
04:44:46.350 --> 04:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
pu presentations in the past and this
 
04:44:48.788 --> 04:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
one was by far the best I have sat
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
through you uh gentlemen have compiled
 
04:44:51.480 --> 04:44:52.750 align:start position:0%
through you uh gentlemen have compiled
an

04:44:52.750 --> 04:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:44:56.350 --> 04:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
excellent handbook if you will of
 
04:44:59.070 --> 04:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
matters that members of this committee
 
04:45:02.430 --> 04:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
can use as reference as we do our work
 
04:45:05.150 --> 04:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
on the legislative side in the upcoming
 
04:45:06.990 --> 04:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
year so I want to thank all three of you
 
04:45:09.190 --> 04:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
for the hard work you've put into this
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
presentation and uh commend you on its
 
04:45:15.110 --> 04:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
on its Excellence than you now I know we
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
have a um a presentation scheduled by
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
the New England Power gener Association
 
04:45:22.750 --> 04:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
at 2 o'cl but I'm going to allow
 
04:45:24.750 --> 04:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
questions for as long as the committee
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
has them to these Commissioners while we
 
04:45:30.430 --> 04:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
have them here because um we don't get a
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
chance to talk to you guys very often so
 
04:45:35.788 --> 04:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi will start us
 
04:45:39.670 --> 04:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
off thank you Mr chairman so uh
 
04:45:41.750 --> 04:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania sits on world's largest
 
04:45:45.070 --> 04:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
supply of uh natural gas and yet we are
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
foreclosed from getting additional
 
04:45:50.470 --> 04:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
natural gas here because New York and
 
04:45:52.948 --> 04:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts have passed laws saying
 
04:45:56.670 --> 04:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
you may not expand or add additional
 
04:45:59.830 --> 04:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
pipelines you talked about Cooperative
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh agreements and and opportunities with
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh working with other Commissioners and
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
working with FK is there an opportunity
 
04:46:10.270 --> 04:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere in there for you to make the
 
04:46:13.470 --> 04:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
case uh through those organizations that
 
04:46:15.310 --> 04:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
the upcoming Department of Justice ought
 
04:46:18.628 --> 04:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
to bring suit against uh those states to
 
04:46:21.110 --> 04:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
stop that uh violation of interstate
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
commerce or any other opportunity for
 
04:46:30.070 --> 04:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.788 --> 04:46:33.798 align:start position:0%
England on the first part not being a
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'm not going to risk commenting
 
04:46:43.230 --> 04:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:49.510 --> 04:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
as um trying to get the benefits of um
 
04:46:51.190 --> 04:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
access to gas
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
markets um that is
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
um something that personally even in the
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
gas electric coordination discussion
 
04:47:03.510 --> 04:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
that we are having it's it's part of the
 
04:47:08.150 --> 04:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
mix so um the important point to me when
 
04:47:09.750 --> 04:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
I'm participating in the regional
 
04:47:13.948 --> 04:47:13.958 align:start position:0%
activities is is um you know the other
 
04:47:18.510 --> 04:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
states also will share their views and
 
04:47:22.190 --> 04:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
the the the main point however is that
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
you know New England this is this is my
 
04:47:28.270 --> 04:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
thinking New England um we have a
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
problem with with extreme Winters so
 
04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's when we rely too much on gas and
 
04:47:36.070 --> 04:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
gas isn't available so that can create a
 
04:47:39.510 --> 04:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
situation that that would be um pretty
 
04:47:43.948 --> 04:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
scary actually so so um we have to do
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
everything possible to solve that
 
04:47:50.948 --> 04:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
problem and that may in my head I you
 
04:47:53.788 --> 04:47:53.798 align:start position:0%
know I'm I don't have a preconceived
 
04:47:57.310 --> 04:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
notion but if there's a need to get gas
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
from somewhere else through whatever
 
04:48:01.590 --> 04:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
mechanisms they're talking about storage
 
04:48:03.788 --> 04:48:03.798 align:start position:0%
they're talking about whether is it even
 
04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
possible to build pipelines a lot of
 
04:48:07.948 --> 04:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
states will tell you that's not
 
04:48:11.230 --> 04:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
happening but I'm I'm just sharing my en
 
04:48:14.350 --> 04:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
talks that it's part of the way I look
 
04:48:14.360 --> 04:48:17.270 align:start position:0%
talks that it's part of the way I look
at

04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:19.628 --> 04:48:19.638 align:start position:0%
things representative Carman has a
 
04:48:22.548 --> 04:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and so
 
04:48:24.830 --> 04:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
good to see the the puc Commissioners
 
04:48:27.548 --> 04:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
here uh chairman goldner you you talked
 
04:48:31.110 --> 04:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
briefly about the enforcement aspect of
 
04:48:32.310 --> 04:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
what the commission does and I'm just
 
04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
wondering can you elaborate on that a
 
04:48:37.830 --> 04:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
bit more um what what sorts of areas you
 
04:48:40.270 --> 04:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
do enforcement and and what that really
 
04:48:43.110 --> 04:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
entails and maybe an example or two
 
04:48:46.350 --> 04:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um so what I I meant to say
 
04:48:50.030 --> 04:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
was that the enforcement uh elements uh
 
04:48:53.230 --> 04:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
and audit elements in that slide went
 
04:48:55.948 --> 04:48:55.958 align:start position:0%
over to the doe so there there is no
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement there is there is no audit
 
04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh within the current puc so I I meant
 
04:49:02.750 --> 04:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
to say that they had shifted over to the
 
04:49:06.830 --> 04:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
energy representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:49:11.868 --> 04:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
question thank you ch
 
04:49:14.830 --> 04:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
um this is so the
 
04:49:17.830 --> 04:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
Pu works a lot with making decisions
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
that that amount to a lot of money and
 
04:49:23.110 --> 04:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
they work with some very powerful um
 
04:49:23.120 --> 04:49:24.750 align:start position:0%
they work with some very powerful um
corporations

04:49:24.750 --> 04:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
04:49:27.070 --> 04:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
Industries it does the puc have an
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
Ethics code and if so is it enforced in
 
04:49:30.000 --> 04:49:30.990 align:start position:0%
Ethics code and if so is it enforced in
any

04:49:30.990 --> 04:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:49:34.948 --> 04:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
way touch on that so the puc is subject
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the executive Branch's ethics code uh
 
04:49:40.230 --> 04:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
which is quite robust and um there is
 
04:49:44.070 --> 04:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
enfor for M of it uh in instances where
 
04:49:46.750 --> 04:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
complaints are made uh by uh the
 
04:49:49.350 --> 04:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office uh and the
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
ethics oversight board uh other than
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
that um the there are statutory
 
04:49:58.830 --> 04:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions that require us to be ethical
 
04:50:00.788 --> 04:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
as well I'm not going to be able to cite
 
04:50:03.670 --> 04:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
it off the top of my head but it's um uh
 
04:50:04.868 --> 04:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
but essentially there's a Code of
 
04:50:07.070 --> 04:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
Conduct separate from the executive
 
04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
branch um uh uh ethics rules that uh
 
04:50:14.830 --> 04:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
we're we must follow uh and it's uh
 
04:50:17.948 --> 04:50:17.958 align:start position:0%
early in in chapter 363 maybe somewhere
 
04:50:22.030 --> 04:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
around section 7 I I don't have my my uh
 
04:50:24.788 --> 04:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
my citation with me and uh but that it's
 
04:50:27.628 --> 04:50:27.638 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere around that area um and
 
04:50:28.990 --> 04:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh but it'll give you a sense of the
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of things and they're quite robust
 
04:50:30.840 --> 04:50:31.868 align:start position:0%
kinds of things and they're quite robust
as

04:50:31.868 --> 04:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:50:34.990 --> 04:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
well representative McGee has a question
 
04:50:36.948 --> 04:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
being here and thank you for taking my
 
04:50:41.670 --> 04:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
question um I'm looking at at uh slide
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
fostering retail competition they don't
 
04:50:46.590 --> 04:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
have numbers on mine so I don't know 39
 
04:50:49.590 --> 04:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
40 oh you can't see them okay all right
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
well fostering retail competition is on
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
the title um what I wanted to ask you
 
04:50:57.548 --> 04:50:57.558 align:start position:0%
about is it looks like some of the
 
04:50:59.830 --> 04:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
considerations or some of the um
 
04:51:01.230 --> 04:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
attributes that you're looking at in
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
terms of fostering retail competition in
 
04:51:05.628 --> 04:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
the energy Market include things that
 
04:51:08.910 --> 04:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
are technology dependent so um time of
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
use rates Dynamic pricing real-time
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
pricing transactive energy markets um
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not really leveraging
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
any of that mostly because we're
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
inhibited by consistent technology that
 
04:51:24.830 --> 04:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
would allow people to um to leverage
 
04:51:28.948 --> 04:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
that so my question is really are are
 
04:51:31.510 --> 04:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
there are there any dockets or any
 
04:51:33.990 --> 04:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
conversations around where the utilities
 
04:51:37.350 --> 04:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
are at in terms of uh moving the state
 
04:51:38.910 --> 04:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
towards those Technologies so that we
 
04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
could leverage those pieces to try and
 
04:51:45.510 --> 04:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
gain efficiencies um not just in how the
 
04:51:48.270 --> 04:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
market operates but also in really sort
 
04:51:51.070 --> 04:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
of dialing in those values that we keep
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
trying to arrive at in terms of rate
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
making and pricing and the value of
 
04:51:58.670 --> 04:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
energy that people are starting to
 
04:52:01.350 --> 04:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
create on their own I know it's a big
 
04:52:10.830 --> 04:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
as far as specific dockets are concerned
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let um chairman gner talk
 
04:52:19.030 --> 04:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
about it but for example data platform
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
that docket is ongoing and
 
04:52:25.948 --> 04:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
um but I'll bring a sort of a different
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
perspective given my participation in
 
04:52:31.990 --> 04:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
Regional activities one of the reasons
 
04:52:34.470 --> 04:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
that we have a working group trying to
 
04:52:38.590 --> 04:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
work on demand response there is
 
04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
essentially also about what do we need
 
04:52:46.628 --> 04:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
in terms of the capacity to allow retail
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
customers to directly participate in
 
04:52:52.510 --> 04:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
Wholesale Electric markets and and that
 
04:52:54.910 --> 04:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
discussion is happening the key players
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
are ISO in England there are other um
 
04:53:00.030 --> 04:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
you know technology driven companies
 
04:53:03.390 --> 04:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
that are also part of the mix there are
 
04:53:06.548 --> 04:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
um companies that provide demand
 
04:53:10.628 --> 04:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
response that are in the discussion so
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
that is that is a goal that in my
 
04:53:16.990 --> 04:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
opinion is going to be not goal that is
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
something that we need to leverage if
 
04:53:23.670 --> 04:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to be solving not merely
 
04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
the the the uh the competitiveness of
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
markets in general but also given what's
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
happening in the gas market so for
 
04:53:34.350 --> 04:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
winter preparedness that's going to be
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
an important element and that's where
 
04:53:38.830 --> 04:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
they can extract value so as a
 
04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
residential customer I can extract a lot
 
04:53:44.830 --> 04:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
more value if I provide some sort of a
 
04:53:47.430 --> 04:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
response during those times that allows
 
04:53:49.830 --> 04:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
you to not rely on gas because it's not
 
04:53:54.548 --> 04:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
there so it's I'm just giving you
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
General yes go ahead so the followup in
 
04:53:58.990 --> 04:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
the conversation you and I are just
 
04:54:04.270 --> 04:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
having is um it sounds like right today
 
04:54:06.390 --> 04:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have an adequate call and
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
response right so if somebody if
 
04:54:11.110 --> 04:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
somebody were had
 
04:54:15.390 --> 04:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
capacity to respond to a demand a need
 
04:54:18.430 --> 04:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
for energy at a certain time of year um
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have the capability to
 
04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
actualize that demand response is that
 
04:54:26.910 --> 04:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
correct um since we are talking in
 
04:54:26.920 --> 04:54:27.990 align:start position:0%
correct um since we are talking in
general

04:54:27.990 --> 04:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
general
 
04:54:32.350 --> 04:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
terms there are uh aggregators that are
 
04:54:34.708 --> 04:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
participating and so that some customers
 
04:54:36.910 --> 04:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
are benefiting from it what I'm talking
 
04:54:36.920 --> 04:54:38.110 align:start position:0%
are benefiting from it what I'm talking
about

04:54:38.110 --> 04:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:54:41.230 --> 04:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
is a more Tech technology driven
 
04:54:46.628 --> 04:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
approach where even uh One retail
 
04:54:48.548 --> 04:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
customer can actually participate in a
 
04:54:50.070 --> 04:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
program and get
 
04:54:53.670 --> 04:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
benefits thank you yeah additional
 
04:54:55.510 --> 04:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
questions uh let's go with
 
04:54:55.520 --> 04:54:57.990 align:start position:0%
questions uh let's go with
representative

04:54:57.990 --> 04:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
paral thank you chair V and thank you
 
04:55:02.750 --> 04:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
puc for being here today um I'm looking
 
04:55:07.030 --> 04:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
at page 15 your commissioner proceedings
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
and you've outlined uh people uh
 
04:55:12.868 --> 04:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
into separate groups Department of
 
04:55:14.910 --> 04:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
energy Office of Consumer Advocates and
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
interveners I would imagine very often
 
04:55:19.830 --> 04:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
the interveners and any given case their
 
04:55:21.270 --> 04:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
testimony might be significantly
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
different than say the department of
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
energy do you find that to be true of
 
04:55:26.548 --> 04:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer Advocate
 
04:55:28.470 --> 04:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
would they do they bring a unique voice
 
04:55:46.430 --> 04:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:48.628 --> 04:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
I think I I I I hate to start with the
 
04:55:50.470 --> 04:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
answer of it depends I hate to start
 
04:55:52.110 --> 04:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
with that but if I talk if I think about
 
04:55:53.470 --> 04:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
the majority of
 
04:55:56.030 --> 04:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
dockets um the office of the consumer
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
Advocate is bringing the rate payer
 
04:56:00.150 --> 04:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
interests I mean so the office of the
 
04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate doesn't participate in
 
04:56:04.190 --> 04:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
every docket partially because it
 
04:56:07.070 --> 04:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know necessarily affect the
 
04:56:10.628 --> 04:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
the rapair interests um the Department
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
of energy is um participates
 
04:56:16.230 --> 04:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
automatically in every
 
04:56:18.590 --> 04:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
docket and so you know there's a
 
04:56:20.430 --> 04:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
difference in that regard and if you're
 
04:56:22.670 --> 04:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
asking about the difference in what
 
04:56:26.788 --> 04:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
they're bringing um the department of
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
energy will provide testimony in many
 
04:56:32.990 --> 04:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
dockets the office of the consumer
 
04:56:35.590 --> 04:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
Advocate not so much um probably a
 
04:56:37.430 --> 04:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
resourcing issue or something like that
 
04:56:40.708 --> 04:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
but uh the the the consumer ADV doesn't
 
04:56:42.910 --> 04:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
provide testimony to the commission with
 
04:56:44.430 --> 04:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
the same kind of frequency that the
 
04:56:46.750 --> 04:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
department does so that's partially an
 
04:56:49.430 --> 04:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
answer to your question the intervenor
 
04:56:51.190 --> 04:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
input is
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
um you know it can be aligned with the
 
04:56:55.628 --> 04:56:55.638 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate and the department and
 
04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
it can be um it can be a little bit
 
04:57:02.708 --> 04:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:07.708 --> 04:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
think I I don't uh I don't
 
04:57:11.470 --> 04:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
see uh a huge difference in what's being
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
what's being brought before
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
us I'm sorry that was not uh so specific
 
04:57:18.030 --> 04:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
but there's so many different cases
 
04:57:19.990 --> 04:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're handling hundreds of cases it's a
 
04:57:22.470 --> 04:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
little bit hard to sort of think about
 
04:57:24.350 --> 04:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
the connection between all of them and I
 
04:57:25.750 --> 04:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
apologize for the vagueness of the
 
04:57:27.510 --> 04:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
answer no problem I that's
 
04:57:29.310 --> 04:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
understandable but thank you
 
04:57:31.030 --> 04:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:57:34.948 --> 04:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um two very
 
04:57:38.230 --> 04:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
quick questions on slide 22 you you list
 
04:57:41.070 --> 04:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
sewage disposal as one of your
 
04:57:43.270 --> 04:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities does that also include
 
04:57:53.390 --> 04:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
biosolids when you say biosolids do you
 
04:57:58.750 --> 04:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
mean uh land spreading of sludge or do
 
04:58:00.670 --> 04:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
you mean something else that that's
 
04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what I mean uh is it's to my
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge we don't handle that okay um
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
and if I could follow up to your
 
04:58:11.830 --> 04:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
previous question uh RSA 360 312 is the
 
04:58:13.830 --> 04:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
statute that deals with the ethical
 
04:58:16.948 --> 04:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
conduct of the Pu thank you um my second
 
04:58:19.868 --> 04:58:19.878 align:start position:0%
question was um and I hate this
 
04:58:23.910 --> 04:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
discussion so much however on Slide Five
 
04:58:26.310 --> 04:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
you say that the doe should provide
 
04:58:28.990 --> 04:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
support shouldn't that be shall Provide
 
04:58:32.990 --> 04:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:36.230 --> 04:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility um that is I've got the
 
04:58:36.240 --> 04:58:37.830 align:start position:0%
responsibility um that is I've got the
statutory

04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
um the statutory provisions Down Below
 
04:58:44.830 --> 04:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
in 12 P2 and 3 and 12 p33 and it it does
 
04:58:47.390 --> 04:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
not say shall in the statute so we're
 
04:58:49.390 --> 04:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
just reporting what the statute tells us
 
04:58:50.750 --> 04:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
to do thank
 
04:58:54.470 --> 04:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
you representative PL has a question uh
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um to commissioner
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
Chad p is
 
04:59:00.480 --> 04:59:04.070 align:start position:0%
Chad p is
it

04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:09.628 --> 04:59:09.638 align:start position:0%
so yes U going back to the page um 25 I
 
04:59:12.910 --> 04:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned you open a docket
 
04:59:14.670 --> 04:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
I'll come to the question you open a
 
04:59:18.070 --> 04:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
docket on uh rate payers requests for
 
04:59:21.390 --> 04:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
rate change and you mentioned that this
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
goes back to representative Wendy
 
04:59:26.110 --> 04:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
Thomas's ethics you mentioned you can't
 
04:59:28.230 --> 04:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
discuss that because of
 
04:59:31.708 --> 04:59:31.718 align:start position:0%
prioritary discussions my question is in
 
04:59:31.718 --> 04:59:32.510 align:start position:0%
prioritary discussions my question is in
that

04:59:32.510 --> 04:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
docket that you can
 
04:59:37.510 --> 04:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
only we know there's a docket open on a
 
04:59:40.990 --> 04:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
rate change we know the end result is
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
what is the ethical and authority of
 
04:59:45.948 --> 04:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
someone to look into the docket to see
 
04:59:49.788 --> 04:59:49.798 align:start position:0%
exactly what transpired in between is is
 
04:59:53.590 --> 04:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
you can I can I ask follow of question
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative um just just so I'm clear
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh are you asking uh where can one get
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
information about the docket or um and
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
maybe see the decision that was made or
 
05:00:10.548 --> 05:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
do you mean something
 
05:00:13.350 --> 05:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
different internally not for the public
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
or myself is there an oversight within
 
05:00:19.510 --> 05:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
the PO of what transpired to come up to
 
05:00:22.390 --> 05:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
that end result you mean the
 
05:00:24.628 --> 05:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner's deliberations
 
05:00:28.868 --> 05:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
then yes we could describe as that uh I
 
05:00:30.830 --> 05:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's oversight in
 
05:00:33.310 --> 05:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
the manner that you might be
 
05:00:36.510 --> 05:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
thinking uh so in other words if the
 
05:00:39.070 --> 05:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners deliberate uh you know
 
05:00:41.470 --> 05:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
they'll have Frank conversations among
 
05:00:44.030 --> 05:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
themselves about a docket that's before
 
05:00:47.070 --> 05:00:47.080 align:start position:0%
them when reaching their decision uh but
 
05:00:49.310 --> 05:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's um there isn't really any
 
05:00:53.670 --> 05:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
oversight of that process um uh other
 
05:00:55.750 --> 05:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
than the public process that this is all
 
05:00:58.350 --> 05:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
part of uh so I mean everything is open
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:01:03.070 --> 05:01:03.080 align:start position:0%
public I think my question was answered
 
05:01:05.230 --> 05:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
yes I was just wondering how it was done
 
05:01:07.510 --> 05:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
so I can see where the Commissioners
 
05:01:11.270 --> 05:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
would have okay open um private disc did
 
05:01:13.230 --> 05:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
I did I answer that correct to answer
 
05:01:15.390 --> 05:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
your question then uh yes chair my
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
question has been answered thank you
 
05:01:17.520 --> 05:01:19.670 align:start position:0%
question has been answered thank you
okay

05:01:19.670 --> 05:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
good I sorry I'm new so
 
05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
no I like to believe I'm new too so um I
 
05:01:30.548 --> 05:01:30.558 align:start position:0%
I didn't fully understand your question
 
05:01:33.548 --> 05:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
but this might be a little bit helpful
 
05:01:38.430 --> 05:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
um when it's for me what's part of the
 
05:01:43.350 --> 05:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
record is extremely important so we have
 
05:01:45.670 --> 05:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
a process it's it's the record gets
 
05:01:49.830 --> 05:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
created and that is the basis for my
 
05:01:52.708 --> 05:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
ability to come to a
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
decision so a followup yes follow up yes
 
05:02:01.470 --> 05:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
you opened that back up by that so the
 
05:02:04.030 --> 05:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
Frank discussions between the
 
05:02:06.548 --> 05:02:06.558 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that is not in the record
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
though is that true
 
05:02:12.470 --> 05:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
the on the deliberations on the
 
05:02:12.480 --> 05:02:14.470 align:start position:0%
the on the deliberations on the
deliberations

05:02:14.470 --> 05:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
deliberations
 
05:02:16.670 --> 05:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
yeah if it was in the record they
 
05:02:20.788 --> 05:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't have Frank discussions yeah so
 
05:02:23.590 --> 05:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
I I I don't see what the issue is
 
05:02:26.110 --> 05:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
there representative plog remember we're
 
05:02:28.708 --> 05:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
here to ask questions not have a debate
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
I was trying to come to the question if
 
05:02:33.270 --> 05:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
it was there and if there was someone
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
else in the department that had
 
05:02:37.470 --> 05:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
oversight to it but now I understand it
 
05:02:40.230 --> 05:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
is not there so that was answer thank
 
05:02:43.708 --> 05:02:43.718 align:start position:0%
you representative Swanson has a
 
05:02:46.230 --> 05:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh this is probably for uh
 
05:02:52.750 --> 05:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner Chad parier did I hopefully
 
05:02:56.390 --> 05:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
get that right and uh any rate uh uh
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of focus on reducing costs
 
05:03:01.310 --> 05:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that we would all agree
 
05:03:03.510 --> 05:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's usually a very
 
05:03:05.310 --> 05:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
good thing but I'm also aware as a
 
05:03:07.628 --> 05:03:07.638 align:start position:0%
homeowner that there are certain things
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
I need to plan for and invest in and
 
05:03:13.270 --> 05:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
I've I gather from your discussion about
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
rfps versus uh I don't know direct
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
negotiation or something like that that
 
05:03:20.548 --> 05:03:20.558 align:start position:0%
you reduce the effort and cost
 
05:03:22.030 --> 05:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
RP uh Gathering uh but I I'm not seeing
 
05:03:30.628 --> 05:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
in the uh emphasis on reducing rates to
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh where investment comes in and I
 
05:03:36.270 --> 05:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
recall my work wife worked for PSNH ages
 
05:03:39.150 --> 05:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
ago and I learned that when a uh for
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
example the electric company wants to
 
05:03:43.830 --> 05:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
build a new power generation plant they
 
05:03:47.150 --> 05:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
need to plan out for say the next 30 or
 
05:03:50.948 --> 05:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
40 years that needs to last that long so
 
05:03:52.510 --> 05:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
they need to figure that out and they
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
also need to realize they're making a
 
05:03:58.270 --> 05:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
huge investment and somehow that's going
 
05:04:01.750 --> 05:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
to have to be paid for uh if the it
 
05:04:04.670 --> 05:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
seems like there's a goal of reducing
 
05:04:07.350 --> 05:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
expenses in the current context of what
 
05:04:10.548 --> 05:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
we have available where is or maybe this
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
is the job of somebody else or perhaps
 
05:04:15.510 --> 05:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
you just leave it to the utility to
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
determine that hey you know we're going
 
05:04:20.270 --> 05:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
to we're either going to have an
 
05:04:23.270 --> 05:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
expansion of demand of electricity and
 
05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
existing sources of Supply aren't going
 
05:04:27.070 --> 05:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
to cover that so we're going to have to
 
05:04:30.510 --> 05:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
make a major investment here uh where
 
05:04:33.510 --> 05:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
where does that fit into this whole
 
05:04:35.670 --> 05:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
picture I I'm glad you asked that
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
question because New Hampshire since the
 
05:04:41.230 --> 05:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
mid90s has been deregulated meaning that
 
05:04:43.868 --> 05:04:43.878 align:start position:0%
the power generation of the utilities in
 
05:04:46.230 --> 05:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are distribution only
 
05:04:49.150 --> 05:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
utilities they don't own the generation
 
05:04:51.390 --> 05:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
so that's a really important distinction
 
05:04:53.948 --> 05:04:53.958 align:start position:0%
because when we talk about default
 
05:04:56.628 --> 05:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
service and all these other sort
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
of strange terms what we're really
 
05:05:01.070 --> 05:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
talking about is these utilities that
 
05:05:01.080 --> 05:05:02.270 align:start position:0%
talking about is these utilities that
are

05:05:02.270 --> 05:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:05:05.708 --> 05:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
now that are now distribution utilities
 
05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
they now have to purchase their power
 
05:05:09.150 --> 05:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
from somewhere so the question is do
 
05:05:11.548 --> 05:05:11.558 align:start position:0%
they purchase from a third party do they
 
05:05:13.270 --> 05:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
purchase it directly from the iso New
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
England market and what has been going
 
05:05:17.190 --> 05:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
on at the commission for the last couple
 
05:05:18.788 --> 05:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
years is we've been
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
investigating going from the current
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
process or let's say the the existing
 
05:05:25.868 --> 05:05:25.878 align:start position:0%
process which was to for the utilities
 
05:05:27.948 --> 05:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
to purchase their power from third
 
05:05:30.270 --> 05:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
parties to going directly to the
 
05:05:32.430 --> 05:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
wholesale market and I'll say it this
 
05:05:36.150 --> 05:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
way cutting out the middleman so um we
 
05:05:38.350 --> 05:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
by looking at the data uh with the
 
05:05:40.430 --> 05:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
utilities and with the doe and with the
 
05:05:42.910 --> 05:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
OCA and with all the parties what we've
 
05:05:44.510 --> 05:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh what we've determined by looking at
 
05:05:47.190 --> 05:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
the data is is that yes it's true that
 
05:05:49.470 --> 05:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
that middle man makes money and so the
 
05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
cheapest way of getting the power is to
 
05:05:53.788 --> 05:05:53.798 align:start position:0%
go directly to the wholesale market like
 
05:05:56.390 --> 05:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
the Costco equivalent of power so that
 
05:05:58.990 --> 05:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
you can get the lowest possible
 
05:06:02.190 --> 05:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
price so sorry follow on question then
 
05:06:04.510 --> 05:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
the wholesale market so you've made
 
05:06:06.750 --> 05:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
several references to the wholesale
 
05:06:10.070 --> 05:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
market and so is that like outs the
 
05:06:12.708 --> 05:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
scope of the things that you do for rate
 
05:06:14.750 --> 05:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
settings and it's some up to somebody
 
05:06:17.788 --> 05:06:17.798 align:start position:0%
else to say Hey you know if I you know
 
05:06:20.510 --> 05:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll get some land and build the
 
05:06:23.708 --> 05:06:23.718 align:start position:0%
power plant and uh then I will offer to
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
sell for so much money to the system so
 
05:06:28.030 --> 05:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
that's the wholesale Market you're
 
05:06:29.788 --> 05:06:29.798 align:start position:0%
referring to and you don't get involved
 
05:06:31.788 --> 05:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
in regulating that because somehow
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
sooner or later that you know the the
 
05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
cost of building that is going to have
 
05:06:39.910 --> 05:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
to be decided up front and then
 
05:06:42.030 --> 05:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's maybe through the that it
 
05:06:45.510 --> 05:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
becomes the wholesale cost yeah me let
 
05:06:48.310 --> 05:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
me try to answer that I think of it as
 
05:06:50.910 --> 05:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
like uh Hub and spokes so the iso New
 
05:06:53.510 --> 05:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
England guys down in Connecticut they're
 
05:06:55.830 --> 05:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
the wholesalers they're the Costco of
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
our space and so you can go into ISO New
 
05:07:02.590 --> 05:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
England on any day at any hour at any
 
05:07:05.190 --> 05:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
minute and you can purchase your power
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
at a wholesale price and so what the
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
utilities do eversource Liberty unitel
 
05:07:14.110 --> 05:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
is that they have two processes for
 
05:07:16.830 --> 05:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
securing their energy Supply today they
 
05:07:20.190 --> 05:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
either um go directly to that wholesale
 
05:07:21.788 --> 05:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
Market the iso New England market and
 
05:07:23.628 --> 05:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
they purchase on a daily or even hourly
 
05:07:26.150 --> 05:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
basis or they can go through that
 
05:07:27.990 --> 05:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
third-party bidding process which
 
05:07:30.350 --> 05:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
happens every six months and right now
 
05:07:32.150 --> 05:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
the commission uh as I think
 
05:07:34.110 --> 05:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner choai just to repeat what
 
05:07:37.548 --> 05:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
he said earlier um today Liberty is at
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
50% wholesale 50% thirdparty bidding the
 
05:07:44.628 --> 05:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
other two utilities are 3070 30%
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
wholesale 70% thirdparty bidding and
 
05:07:49.548 --> 05:07:49.558 align:start position:0%
that's the mix of power that they're
 
05:07:51.990 --> 05:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
purchasing from the market for their
 
05:07:54.590 --> 05:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
customers um so that's that's we call
 
05:07:57.708 --> 05:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
that default service which is the the
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
the power that's secured for you so that
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
you don't have to worry about it as a
 
05:08:05.350 --> 05:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
homeowner I can see that I did not quite
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
answer your
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
question but I tried I I I don't want to
 
05:08:10.990 --> 05:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
drag it out but I I guess I'm still not
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
getting the answer I thought about
 
05:08:15.390 --> 05:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
what's the what's driving the wholesale
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
Market to invest so ISO New England has
 
05:08:26.430 --> 05:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
a cue of new construction for for new uh
 
05:08:28.430 --> 05:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
generation facilities that are going to
 
05:08:31.230 --> 05:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
be built over the next whatever number
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
of years that's where that's the answer
 
05:08:36.030 --> 05:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
to your question if you could look at
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
that cue you you could see what is o New
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
England thinks when you need to build or
 
05:08:46.548 --> 05:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
what generators have come to is ISO New
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
England and offered to build and get in
 
05:08:52.030 --> 05:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
that queue so that they can build
 
05:08:54.390 --> 05:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
generation for the future okay thanks Mr
 
05:08:56.670 --> 05:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
chair that's very good and if I if I
 
05:08:58.628 --> 05:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
could add and that's a nice segue into
 
05:09:00.270 --> 05:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
our next presentation from the New
 
05:09:02.590 --> 05:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
England power generator Association but
 
05:09:05.310 --> 05:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean to interrupt you Mr Del
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
orano thank you Mr chair uh if I could
 
05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
just maybe add a little bit of Clarity
 
05:09:11.948 --> 05:09:11.958 align:start position:0%
uh so before I was in government service
 
05:09:13.868 --> 05:09:13.878 align:start position:0%
I represented a lot of renewable energy
 
05:09:16.868 --> 05:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
developers so I can tell you how their
 
05:09:18.628 --> 05:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
thinking is around some of this stuff
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
and this pretty much goes for any
 
05:09:22.590 --> 05:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
generator not just the renewable folks
 
05:09:25.868 --> 05:09:25.878 align:start position:0%
is that um all generators now are price
 
05:09:28.390 --> 05:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
takers okay so they're not price makers
 
05:09:30.628 --> 05:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
like they were in the past when we had a
 
05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated utility system in
 
05:09:35.230 --> 05:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so that means that if you
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
are just say for instance a solar
 
05:09:40.390 --> 05:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
developer and uh you want to
 
05:09:43.628 --> 05:09:43.638 align:start position:0%
interconnect uh you know a megawatt of
 
05:09:46.030 --> 05:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
solar here in New Hampshire uh onto the
 
05:09:48.830 --> 05:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
grid someplace you need to model your
 
05:09:52.030 --> 05:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
economics around what the wholesale
 
05:09:55.310 --> 05:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
price is what what price you there
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
actually going to get for that power but
 
05:10:01.150 --> 05:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
solar like some other Renewables they
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
have other adders to them so you've got
 
05:10:07.230 --> 05:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
RPS um you have uh tax credits one of
 
05:10:08.708 --> 05:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
the things that I did in private
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
practice was I monetized tax credits for
 
05:10:13.628 --> 05:10:13.638 align:start position:0%
folks so that uh they could develop some
 
05:10:15.470 --> 05:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
of these uh solar
 
05:10:15.480 --> 05:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
of these uh solar
projects

05:10:17.030 --> 05:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
projects
 
05:10:19.948 --> 05:10:19.958 align:start position:0%
and once you kind of have a handle on
 
05:10:21.150 --> 05:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
those things I'm trying to keep this
 
05:10:24.430 --> 05:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
very general uh then a developer can
 
05:10:26.350 --> 05:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
make a economic decision to see whether
 
05:10:27.510 --> 05:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
or not they're going to be able to make
 
05:10:30.548 --> 05:10:30.558 align:start position:0%
their required rate of return these
 
05:10:32.910 --> 05:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
things have nothing to do with what uh
 
05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
we regulate on on the Utility side the
 
05:10:37.628 --> 05:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
Investments we regulate are to the
 
05:10:40.110 --> 05:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
distribution system not on the
 
05:10:43.590 --> 05:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
generation side so really free market
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
participants uh developers are the folks
 
05:10:49.750 --> 05:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
that uh decide whether or not their
 
05:10:52.110 --> 05:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
economic model is going to work for them
 
05:10:54.670 --> 05:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
and uh they'll attract investment for it
 
05:10:58.230 --> 05:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
as well as uh uh debt financing uh and
 
05:11:00.590 --> 05:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
again monetizing those uh federal tax
 
05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
credits are also very important but uh
 
05:11:04.948 --> 05:11:04.958 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day being a price
 
05:11:06.830 --> 05:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
taker they have to model their economics
 
05:11:08.788 --> 05:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
around what the market is likely to pay
 
05:11:10.830 --> 05:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
for their power and so it's a risky
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
business it's not as uh it's not a um a
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
sure thing uh you know prog some
 
05:11:19.470 --> 05:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
programs look to try and uh uh you know
 
05:11:23.350 --> 05:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
normalize that a bit but uh it's not a
 
05:11:26.910 --> 05:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's not like how it was when uh
 
05:11:28.910 --> 05:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
Public Service would decide to build a
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
power plant uh and they would forecast
 
05:11:34.548 --> 05:11:34.558 align:start position:0%
out demand for a number of years and
 
05:11:36.750 --> 05:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
they would build a facility in order to
 
05:11:39.670 --> 05:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
meet that demand it's somewhat different
 
05:11:41.830 --> 05:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
does did that answer your
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
question okay great I think we need to
 
05:11:47.868 --> 05:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
uh segue into our next presentation from
 
05:11:49.310 --> 05:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
the New
 
05:11:51.230 --> 05:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
England what's
 
05:11:54.110 --> 05:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
that all right one last question and
 
05:11:55.548 --> 05:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
then we'll move on to the New England
 
05:11:57.310 --> 05:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
power generators Association thank you
 
05:11:59.430 --> 05:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
and I look forward to that presentation
 
05:12:01.590 --> 05:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
um just a very quick question on on
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
slide 14 the last bullet is that the
 
05:12:06.190 --> 05:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
commission can order reparations or
 
05:12:08.030 --> 05:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
impose penalties can you give us some
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
examples of reparations or penalties and
 
05:12:15.170 --> 05:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:15.180 --> 05:12:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:12:22.070 --> 05:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:25.270 --> 05:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
you you want me okay uh so I'm GNA
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
answer your your second part of your
 
05:12:29.110 --> 05:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
question first uh again I'm I'm new to
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
the commission so I couldn't tell you
 
05:12:32.670 --> 05:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
when the last time the commission had uh
 
05:12:35.110 --> 05:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
imposed a penalty or reparations
 
05:12:36.310 --> 05:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
generally what this is around is
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints so if a consumer
 
05:12:40.510 --> 05:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
complains about a you know being charged
 
05:12:41.910 --> 05:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh more than what they were supposed to
 
05:12:44.310 --> 05:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
be charged uh that complaint would first
 
05:12:45.868 --> 05:12:45.878 align:start position:0%
originate over at the department of
 
05:12:47.310 --> 05:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
energy the department of energy would
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
investigate the complaint uh and would
 
05:12:53.070 --> 05:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
generally be resolved at that level
 
05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
however let's imagine a situation where
 
05:12:58.548 --> 05:12:58.558 align:start position:0%
a rape payer was uh still dissatisfied
 
05:13:01.230 --> 05:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
that rape payer could then um it's not
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
quite appeal but they could then
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
petition the Pu to look into that matter
 
05:13:07.910 --> 05:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
and the Pu could hold a hearing and try
 
05:13:10.030 --> 05:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
to judge the facts of it to see whether
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
or not the utility had actually acted
 
05:13:16.510 --> 05:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
wrongly in that case um if we find that
 
05:13:18.750 --> 05:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
they did then uh we could impose a
 
05:13:21.868 --> 05:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
penalty and by reparations that means uh
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
if someone paid uh you know 9 cents
 
05:13:27.750 --> 05:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
instead of 5 cents then uh we could give
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
them the Delta of 4 cents as part of
 
05:13:31.390 --> 05:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
that order that that's mainly what
 
05:13:33.910 --> 05:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's uh around there are some other
 
05:13:36.510 --> 05:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
more nuanced areas but um they don't
 
05:13:39.670 --> 05:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
arise frequently uh and uh I I don't
 
05:13:41.190 --> 05:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
know have you guys ever rewarded
 
05:13:43.750 --> 05:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
reparations to anybody no so this is
 
05:13:46.030 --> 05:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't come up I think in
 
05:13:51.270 --> 05:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
while again I cannot give you a specific
 
05:13:56.350 --> 05:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
docket but I'm going back to my
 
05:13:59.190 --> 05:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
experience so this is before I became a
 
05:14:01.750 --> 05:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner I do remember there were
 
05:14:04.750 --> 05:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
times when a utility was penalized so
 
05:14:06.590 --> 05:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving a general context so you
 
05:14:06.600 --> 05:14:08.030 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving a general context so you
know

05:14:08.030 --> 05:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:14:13.190 --> 05:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:15.830 --> 05:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
recollection okay I want to thank all
 
05:14:19.708 --> 05:14:19.718 align:start position:0%
three of you again for being here a
 
05:14:19.718 --> 05:14:21.788 align:start position:0%
three of you again for being here a
outstanding

05:14:21.788 --> 05:14:21.798 align:start position:0%
outstanding
 
05:14:24.150 --> 05:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
presentation excellent answers to our
 
05:14:26.110 --> 05:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
questions we really appreciate you
 
05:14:29.270 --> 05:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
providing that resource to us thank you
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
again all right next up the New England
 
05:14:46.390 --> 05:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:48.310 --> 05:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Molly and Dan I'll let
 
05:14:49.470 --> 05:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
you introduce
 
05:14:56.030 --> 05:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
stn and we're happy to be here while
 
05:15:00.990 --> 05:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
while everyone gets settled Dan our um
 
05:15:03.430 --> 05:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
president is um handing out our
 
05:15:05.990 --> 05:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
presentation um in the interest of time
 
05:15:07.788 --> 05:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
we thought we would keep this more
 
05:15:10.230 --> 05:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
conversational um and so we will refer
 
05:15:12.230 --> 05:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
to this but we're not going through the
 
05:15:13.948 --> 05:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
slides if you would rather we want to
 
05:15:16.548 --> 05:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
give you a brief orientation as to who
 
05:15:19.110 --> 05:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
we are um and and what we do and how we
 
05:15:21.150 --> 05:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
got here and what the grid looks like
 
05:15:22.990 --> 05:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
now and going forward and really reserve
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
the majority of the time for question
 
05:15:27.350 --> 05:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
and answer as I know that that's really
 
05:15:28.990 --> 05:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
where where the committee wanted to
 
05:15:32.430 --> 05:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
spend its time so once so I'll give
 
05:15:34.470 --> 05:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
people a moment to make sure they have
 
05:15:34.480 --> 05:15:36.948 align:start position:0%
people a moment to make sure they have
their

05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:39.670 --> 05:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
presentation Jump Right In all right
 
05:15:41.310 --> 05:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for your time
 
05:15:42.910 --> 05:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
I'm Molly Connors I'm an analyst with
 
05:15:44.230 --> 05:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
the New England power generators
 
05:15:46.470 --> 05:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
Association this is Dan Dolan my boss
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
our president um so we I I think we'll
 
05:15:51.788 --> 05:15:51.798 align:start position:0%
be able to clarify any questions
 
05:15:54.190 --> 05:15:54.200 align:start position:0%
regarding wholesale markets and the way
 
05:15:56.110 --> 05:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
power plants are developed I was here
 
05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
for the Pu and know that there were some
 
05:16:00.430 --> 05:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
questions around that hopefully between
 
05:16:02.470 --> 05:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
us today and ISO New England tomorrow
 
05:16:04.230 --> 05:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to get some clarity on
 
05:16:06.750 --> 05:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
those issues on how on how the wholesale
 
05:16:09.150 --> 05:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
markets work and and how they developed
 
05:16:12.590 --> 05:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
so first off um who are we um in in your
 
05:16:13.910 --> 05:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
presentation this would be slide two
 
05:16:15.910 --> 05:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is really our cover slide who are
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
we um the we represent the the power
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
generating facilities the power plants
 
05:16:23.190 --> 05:16:23.200 align:start position:0%
in New England that are not owned by
 
05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
utilities and so that's the vast
 
05:16:27.230 --> 05:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
majority of power plants in New England
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
they are not own owned by vertically
 
05:16:31.548 --> 05:16:31.558 align:start position:0%
integrated utilities and so our Members
 
05:16:34.868 --> 05:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
Own and operate about 27,000 megawatt of
 
05:16:37.070 --> 05:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
generating capacity that's the vast
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
majority well over 95% % of the
 
05:16:42.430 --> 05:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
generating capacity in New England um of
 
05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
that we have just about every type of
 
05:16:47.070 --> 05:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
technology in our membership we have
 
05:16:49.430 --> 05:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
coal plant we have oil gas we have
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
nuclear lots of solar offshore wind um
 
05:16:55.270 --> 05:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
onshore wind really every type of
 
05:16:57.788 --> 05:16:57.798 align:start position:0%
technology is probably a member of our
 
05:17:00.590 --> 05:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
of our of our organization um of the
 
05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
27,000 megawatts though about 30% are
 
05:17:05.788 --> 05:17:05.798 align:start position:0%
non-emitting or renewable that could be
 
05:17:07.548 --> 05:17:07.558 align:start position:0%
nuclear that could be a different type
 
05:17:10.350 --> 05:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
of um of Ren resource again it sort of
 
05:17:11.990 --> 05:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
underscores the diversity of the
 
05:17:13.750 --> 05:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
generating facilities in New
 
05:17:16.868 --> 05:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
England um collectively about you know
 
05:17:19.510 --> 05:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
about 4,000 people are employed by the
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
generating facilities throughout New
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
England specific to New Hampshire our
 
05:17:26.350 --> 05:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
members um provide about
 
05:17:29.788 --> 05:17:29.798 align:start position:0%
4,300 megawatts of generating capacity
 
05:17:32.030 --> 05:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
um and really there is a a a large
 
05:17:34.430 --> 05:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
amount of diversity within that too we
 
05:17:36.350 --> 05:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
have a nuclear power plant there are
 
05:17:39.310 --> 05:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
biomass facilities um run a river Hydro
 
05:17:41.590 --> 05:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
facilities solar facilities again
 
05:17:43.230 --> 05:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of diversity within the
 
05:17:45.910 --> 05:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
membership um and within within New
 
05:17:48.310 --> 05:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about 1800 megawatts are
 
05:17:51.990 --> 05:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
carbon free or zero carbon and about 750
 
05:17:53.788 --> 05:17:53.798 align:start position:0%
to a th000 people are employed at the
 
05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
power plants in New England so that's
 
05:18:00.390 --> 05:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
the oh um do we want questions or should
 
05:18:00.400 --> 05:18:01.590 align:start position:0%
the oh um do we want questions or should
I

05:18:01.590 --> 05:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:18:05.590 --> 05:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
keep okay the my question is it says um
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
you provide approximately 4,300
 
05:18:09.788 --> 05:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
megawatts of capacity for New Hampshire
 
05:18:11.070 --> 05:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
and I was just wondering if you knew
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
what the overall
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
capacity number is for the State of New
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in other words like what
 
05:18:19.350 --> 05:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
percentage um so I would say um when we
 
05:18:20.788 --> 05:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
think about power generating in the
 
05:18:23.590 --> 05:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
megawatts um there our members NEPA
 
05:18:25.868 --> 05:18:25.878 align:start position:0%
represents by and large the larger power
 
05:18:28.548 --> 05:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
plants now certainly there are smaller
 
05:18:30.430 --> 05:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
um smaller power plants in particular
 
05:18:32.590 --> 05:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of hydro facilities the
 
05:18:34.628 --> 05:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
larger Hydro facilities are members of
 
05:18:37.548 --> 05:18:37.558 align:start position:0%
NEPA um I would say usually one or five
 
05:18:39.670 --> 05:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
megawatts or greater but throughout New
 
05:18:41.270 --> 05:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and really New England there
 
05:18:43.230 --> 05:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
are a lot of smaller hydros those are
 
05:18:45.470 --> 05:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily NEPA members same for
 
05:18:47.350 --> 05:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
solar if there's a solar facility that's
 
05:18:49.670 --> 05:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
commercial scale large it's largely a
 
05:18:51.830 --> 05:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
NEPA member but the smaller ones like
 
05:18:54.150 --> 05:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
rooftop solar those typically are not
 
05:18:55.510 --> 05:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
members of our
 
05:18:57.430 --> 05:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
organization okay I think what I was
 
05:18:59.830 --> 05:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get at was of if 4,300
 
05:19:04.548 --> 05:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
megawatts is uh what percentage of do do
 
05:19:06.590 --> 05:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
you have an idea of how many megawatts
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
we need in order to supply our electric
 
05:19:11.310 --> 05:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
needs currently um that's a good
 
05:19:13.110 --> 05:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
question I think um so I would say our
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
Members Plus the smaller ones that I
 
05:19:16.788 --> 05:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned are the total amount I don't
 
05:19:17.830 --> 05:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
know I think that might be a good
 
05:19:19.948 --> 05:19:19.958 align:start position:0%
question for ISO New England or can take
 
05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
a crack so representative good to see
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
you um uh it's a comparable percentage
 
05:19:28.430 --> 05:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
to what it is region wide so we are in
 
05:19:32.150 --> 05:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
the upper 90% of overall capacity it is
 
05:19:33.948 --> 05:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
notable however that New Hampshire is a
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
net exporter of electricity as well and
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
so if the specific Quest is what
 
05:19:41.910 --> 05:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of our members provide the
 
05:19:43.708 --> 05:19:43.718 align:start position:0%
needs of New Hampshire I don't have
 
05:19:45.590 --> 05:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
those numbers to to my fingertips
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
because it gets a little tricky what's
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
in State versus sold into the the
 
05:19:48.958 --> 05:19:52.510 align:start position:0%
in State versus sold into the the
regional

05:19:52.510 --> 05:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:55.350 --> 05:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
market thank you um so moving on to the
 
05:19:57.070 --> 05:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
to the next slide I want to get a little
 
05:19:59.190 --> 05:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
bit into something I think the committee
 
05:20:00.670 --> 05:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
has already discussed a little bit which
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
is how did we get where we are why are
 
05:20:05.708 --> 05:20:05.718 align:start position:0%
the merchant power plants not owned by
 
05:20:07.590 --> 05:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
utilities and I think the previous
 
05:20:09.390 --> 05:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
speakers got to this a little little bit
 
05:20:11.110 --> 05:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know for from the time electricity
 
05:20:13.750 --> 05:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
was invented um your utility owned
 
05:20:15.750 --> 05:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
everything it owned the power plant it
 
05:20:17.628 --> 05:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
owned the big transmission line it owned
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
the distribution the smaller line You
 
05:20:20.910 --> 05:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
could argue they even owned the
 
05:20:22.510 --> 05:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
customers because customers had no
 
05:20:25.548 --> 05:20:25.558 align:start position:0%
choice um over time particularly in New
 
05:20:28.270 --> 05:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
England in the 90s there were increasing
 
05:20:30.990 --> 05:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
frustrations with consumers with
 
05:20:33.070 --> 05:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
legislators with Regulators that the
 
05:20:35.310 --> 05:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
cost overruns at utilities were
 
05:20:37.548 --> 05:20:37.558 align:start position:0%
unmanageable um largely focused on
 
05:20:39.190 --> 05:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
construction and operation of power
 
05:20:41.150 --> 05:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
plants really We Were Striking a point
 
05:20:43.070 --> 05:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
where regulation was just insufficient
 
05:20:45.470 --> 05:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
to get at the challenges a lot of cost
 
05:20:47.230 --> 05:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
overruns with power plants and then the
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
inefficient operations of them and so
 
05:20:50.830 --> 05:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
what what happened was a lot of
 
05:20:52.910 --> 05:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
legislators decided to break up the
 
05:20:54.990 --> 05:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
Monopoly in terms of the power
 
05:20:57.110 --> 05:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
generating facilities and so what they
 
05:20:59.310 --> 05:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
did was Al allow the power plants to be
 
05:21:01.430 --> 05:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
sold off from the utilities and private
 
05:21:03.990 --> 05:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
companies that Focus exclusively on
 
05:21:06.030 --> 05:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
operating and constructing and
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
maintaining power plants took over that
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
specific part of the energy system and
 
05:21:12.430 --> 05:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why now you have these energy
 
05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
companies that Focus almost exclusively
 
05:21:17.948 --> 05:21:17.958 align:start position:0%
on on running and operating power plants
 
05:21:20.230 --> 05:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
as in comparison with the utility that's
 
05:21:21.990 --> 05:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
really focusing on wires and poles and
 
05:21:24.750 --> 05:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
delivering electricity and so we we have
 
05:21:26.548 --> 05:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
seen a number of improvements as a
 
05:21:28.750 --> 05:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
result of this first off the overall
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
efficiency at most plants increased by
 
05:21:33.510 --> 05:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
20% just by spinning them off from the
 
05:21:36.110 --> 05:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
utilities and focusing them uh forcing
 
05:21:38.030 --> 05:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
them to be um subject to competitive
 
05:21:40.190 --> 05:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
forces that's almost like if you you
 
05:21:41.990 --> 05:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
know if you needed five plants under
 
05:21:44.070 --> 05:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
utility ownership to meet a certain need
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
under competition you needed only four
 
05:21:48.390 --> 05:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's a significant Market Improvement
 
05:21:49.990 --> 05:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
and Dan will talk more about what that's
 
05:21:52.030 --> 05:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
meant in terms of cost and in terms of
 
05:21:53.628 --> 05:21:53.638 align:start position:0%
environmental impact but overall it's
 
05:21:56.590 --> 05:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
been very very positive um and I would
 
05:21:58.670 --> 05:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
just um end my portion of the sort of
 
05:22:00.750 --> 05:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
how did we get here by saying you know
 
05:22:02.590 --> 05:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
after restructuring after the power
 
05:22:04.750 --> 05:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
plants were sold off we have still seen
 
05:22:06.990 --> 05:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
significant investment in New England in
 
05:22:09.070 --> 05:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
terms of power plants billions of
 
05:22:10.628 --> 05:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
dollars have been invested more than
 
05:22:13.070 --> 05:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
10,000 megawatts of power generating
 
05:22:14.350 --> 05:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
facilities have been constructed
 
05:22:16.390 --> 05:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
throughout New England in response to
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
competitive forces and that has all been
 
05:22:21.270 --> 05:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
without rate payer risk this has not
 
05:22:22.510 --> 05:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
been part of the rate base in the
 
05:22:24.430 --> 05:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
utilities this has been outside of
 
05:22:26.470 --> 05:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
economic regulation this has been
 
05:22:28.830 --> 05:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
through competitive forces administered
 
05:22:34.270 --> 05:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:36.510 --> 05:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
England can we interrupt you for a
 
05:22:39.190 --> 05:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
question here of course you're the chair
 
05:22:41.670 --> 05:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative Vice chair Thomas thank
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh thank you for taking
 
05:22:45.910 --> 05:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
my question since you open the door uh
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
my of your last statement I will say
 
05:22:54.270 --> 05:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
therefore do you see a open opportunity
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
in investment for small scale nuclear to
 
05:22:59.070 --> 05:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
come in into the state and would you
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
support that you know that's a very good
 
05:23:03.110 --> 05:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
question some of our members are do own
 
05:23:04.910 --> 05:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
nuclear facilities right now what we're
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
hearing is um and I'm sure Dan will at
 
05:23:11.070 --> 05:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
on this but small modular nuclear
 
05:23:13.510 --> 05:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
reactors are extremely expensive and the
 
05:23:15.110 --> 05:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity markets have
 
05:23:17.110 --> 05:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
driven cost down overall that has
 
05:23:19.548 --> 05:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
benefited consumers um I know that this
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
is a technology that's of great interest
 
05:23:24.070 --> 05:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
to a lot of people right now what we
 
05:23:25.868 --> 05:23:25.878 align:start position:0%
hear from our members who do invest in
 
05:23:28.390 --> 05:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
power plants is a challenge is the
 
05:23:31.510 --> 05:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
capital intensity the cost of building a
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
new nuclear power facility even a small
 
05:23:37.110 --> 05:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
modular reactor can be quite
 
05:23:40.750 --> 05:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
inhibitive and if if I could pile on to
 
05:23:43.350 --> 05:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
that I think part of the the mix and the
 
05:23:45.750 --> 05:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
challenge that that we Face here is uh
 
05:23:47.788 --> 05:23:47.798 align:start position:0%
resources that are high Capital cost
 
05:23:50.270 --> 05:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
upfront cost that then have low marginal
 
05:23:52.590 --> 05:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
cost in terms of the energy they produce
 
05:23:55.628 --> 05:23:55.638 align:start position:0%
to uh to come into place think nuclear
 
05:23:58.150 --> 05:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
think things like wind some some other
 
05:24:01.270 --> 05:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
resources like that versus relatively
 
05:24:04.110 --> 05:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
lower upfront Capital cost but then a
 
05:24:06.270 --> 05:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
higher marginal cost to operate and
 
05:24:07.990 --> 05:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
again here an example is something like
 
05:24:09.750 --> 05:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
a natural gas power plant where it's
 
05:24:12.190 --> 05:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
relatively cheaper to build but then has
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
a higher fuel cost to operate into the
 
05:24:17.470 --> 05:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
market to that tension that exists in in
 
05:24:19.910 --> 05:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
every electricity Market in in the world
 
05:24:22.030 --> 05:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to small modular reactors
 
05:24:24.990 --> 05:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
in general I am long-term quite bullish
 
05:24:28.230 --> 05:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
but we need to build one somewhere first
 
05:24:29.948 --> 05:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
and that right now is the biggest
 
05:24:31.788 --> 05:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
challenge is there are pilot projects
 
05:24:34.190 --> 05:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
and initial projects in places like
 
05:24:34.200 --> 05:24:35.708 align:start position:0%
and initial projects in places like
Ontario

05:24:35.708 --> 05:24:35.718 align:start position:0%
Ontario
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
Wyoming let's see how some of those
 
05:24:40.510 --> 05:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
initial developments work and then I
 
05:24:42.868 --> 05:24:42.878 align:start position:0%
think the site of large scale existing
 
05:24:45.350 --> 05:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
nuclear facilities like seabook are
 
05:24:47.590 --> 05:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
prime opportunities to potentially add
 
05:24:50.430 --> 05:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
on to look something like a small
 
05:24:53.670 --> 05:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
modular reactor but right now we see it
 
05:24:55.990 --> 05:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
as something that is unlikely to to
 
05:24:58.030 --> 05:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
happen in a place like New England until
 
05:25:02.708 --> 05:25:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:05.070 --> 05:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
elsewhere representative
 
05:25:07.150 --> 05:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:25:08.310 --> 05:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
for coming in to take our question
 
05:25:11.548 --> 05:25:11.558 align:start position:0%
questions today um in a similar vein I'm
 
05:25:12.868 --> 05:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
wondering if you're if from a
 
05:25:14.948 --> 05:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
generator's perspective would do you see
 
05:25:17.788 --> 05:25:17.798 align:start position:0%
uh the prospect for renewable utility
 
05:25:20.430 --> 05:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
scale generation you know uh we talked
 
05:25:21.590 --> 05:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
this morning about the renewable
 
05:25:23.110 --> 05:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard and you know where
 
05:25:26.350 --> 05:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to go uh you know just
 
05:25:28.868 --> 05:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
based on Market forces going out 10 20
 
05:25:30.270 --> 05:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
years what what is the outlook for
 
05:25:32.070 --> 05:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
utility scale renewable including
 
05:25:32.080 --> 05:25:33.390 align:start position:0%
utility scale renewable including
offshore

05:25:33.390 --> 05:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
offshore
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
wind uh so we we see a a tremendous
 
05:25:38.670 --> 05:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
amount of development of renew that's
 
05:25:40.670 --> 05:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
been the fastest growing segment of the
 
05:25:42.830 --> 05:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
New England fuel mix overall if you skip
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
over to to slide seven here you'll see
 
05:25:47.750 --> 05:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
that Renewables now make up just under
 
05:25:50.868 --> 05:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
20% of the actual generation uh the
 
05:25:52.708 --> 05:25:52.718 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours produced in in New
 
05:25:55.868 --> 05:25:55.878 align:start position:0%
England a lot of that is some of the um
 
05:25:59.310 --> 05:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
the older Legacy Hydro uh facilities a
 
05:26:00.670 --> 05:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
number of which are on the Connecticut
 
05:26:02.430 --> 05:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
River here in in New Hampshire but we
 
05:26:04.948 --> 05:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
also see that from growing segments of
 
05:26:08.310 --> 05:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
utility scale large scale wind solar uh
 
05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
we do represent um the first commercial
 
05:26:13.150 --> 05:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
scale offshore Wind Facility Vineyard
 
05:26:15.628 --> 05:26:15.638 align:start position:0%
offshore uh off the coast of of
 
05:26:17.230 --> 05:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and we continue to see
 
05:26:20.788 --> 05:26:20.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities for for Renewables r large
 
05:26:22.990 --> 05:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
um if if I could bounce around a little
 
05:26:24.150 --> 05:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
bit here because I think this is going
 
05:26:26.470 --> 05:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
to touch on some of this if you then
 
05:26:29.150 --> 05:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
skip over to to slides nine and 10 here
 
05:26:30.868 --> 05:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to try and take
 
05:26:33.910 --> 05:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
collectively I think fundamentally uh
 
05:26:35.990 --> 05:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
the the issue that that we have whether
 
05:26:39.310 --> 05:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
that's with respect to um uh the I think
 
05:26:40.590 --> 05:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
the the question earlier from
 
05:26:42.788 --> 05:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
representative Swanson to the the Pu
 
05:26:44.470 --> 05:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner some of the questions here
 
05:26:48.150 --> 05:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
with new nuclear and and Renewables
 
05:26:52.030 --> 05:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
is what is the the actual Supply mix
 
05:26:53.990 --> 05:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to need uh not today
 
05:26:56.788 --> 05:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
but tomorrow uh what are the the price
 
05:26:58.470 --> 05:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
signals that are going to help get us
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
there and to what degree is investment
 
05:27:03.150 --> 05:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
going to support that and how does that
 
05:27:06.030 --> 05:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
fundamentally get at the most important
 
05:27:08.270 --> 05:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
element of these markets which is reli
 
05:27:12.430 --> 05:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
ility and so what we see today is a
 
05:27:14.350 --> 05:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
major point of transition in in the
 
05:27:16.470 --> 05:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
electricity market and we've seeing
 
05:27:19.150 --> 05:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
these come almost once every 10 years or
 
05:27:21.868 --> 05:27:21.878 align:start position:0%
so feels like it's the rhythm of this uh
 
05:27:23.910 --> 05:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
where right now we see significant
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
amounts of older generation uh either
 
05:27:29.150 --> 05:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
retiring or making announcements for for
 
05:27:30.788 --> 05:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
permanent retirement what you see on
 
05:27:33.910 --> 05:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
slide nine is uh a number of those
 
05:27:36.270 --> 05:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
facilities that uh between the years
 
05:27:40.110 --> 05:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
2024 and 2028 we expect roughly 3,000
 
05:27:43.030 --> 05:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
megawatt of existing facilities to go
 
05:27:46.150 --> 05:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
away in place of that there has been a
 
05:27:48.310 --> 05:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
tremendous push particularly from some
 
05:27:50.110 --> 05:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
of the Southern New England states to
 
05:27:53.470 --> 05:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
then uh uh determine what types of
 
05:27:55.510 --> 05:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
resources they want to see come in and
 
05:27:58.230 --> 05:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
and replace that almost entirely uh
 
05:28:00.310 --> 05:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
renewable uh facilities and so they've
 
05:28:02.470 --> 05:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
entered into decades long contract to
 
05:28:05.670 --> 05:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
support some of those those facilities
 
05:28:08.110 --> 05:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
and here we see large scale growth on so
 
05:28:11.230 --> 05:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
solar offshore wind and Contracting for
 
05:28:13.590 --> 05:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
Canadian Hydro over new transmission
 
05:28:17.350 --> 05:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
line this that those numbers should
 
05:28:19.990 --> 05:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
roughly over the next four or five years
 
05:28:22.590 --> 05:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
balance out with about 3,000 megawatts
 
05:28:24.910 --> 05:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
going away about 3,000 megawatts
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
entering the market and again this has
 
05:28:30.110 --> 05:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
been the rhythm of this market for about
 
05:28:32.948 --> 05:28:32.958 align:start position:0%
30 years now the challenge that is
 
05:28:35.070 --> 05:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
unique to today and I think moving
 
05:28:38.470 --> 05:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
forward uh and and I I would be most
 
05:28:39.788 --> 05:28:39.798 align:start position:0%
interested in having the conversation
 
05:28:42.830 --> 05:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
with this committee is that system has
 
05:28:45.948 --> 05:28:45.958 align:start position:0%
worked um very smoothly in large part
 
05:28:48.548 --> 05:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
because over those last 20 to 30 years
 
05:28:51.390 --> 05:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
electricity demand has regularly gone
 
05:28:53.708 --> 05:28:53.718 align:start position:0%
down and so there has been much more
 
05:28:56.510 --> 05:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to match some of that exit and
 
05:28:58.510 --> 05:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
entry in the marketplace with a little
 
05:29:00.990 --> 05:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
bit more wiggle room what we are now
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
facing is the first period of time in a
 
05:29:05.948 --> 05:29:05.958 align:start position:0%
long long time in which demand is going
 
05:29:08.230 --> 05:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
up now it's going up slowly right now
 
05:29:11.430 --> 05:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
now but the expectation is that that
 
05:29:14.190 --> 05:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
increase could certainly accelerate and
 
05:29:15.190 --> 05:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
certainly I think we have a
 
05:29:17.070 --> 05:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility to examine what happens
 
05:29:20.310 --> 05:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
if it does accelerate and that now
 
05:29:22.628 --> 05:29:22.638 align:start position:0%
collapses that wiggle room that
 
05:29:25.548 --> 05:29:25.558 align:start position:0%
bandwidth and the the challenge Now is
 
05:29:28.670 --> 05:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
really making sure that as we get those
 
05:29:31.150 --> 05:29:31.160 align:start position:0%
entry and exit signals that they are
 
05:29:33.270 --> 05:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
lining up and that there is not a lag
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
time uh between those that we continue
 
05:29:38.430 --> 05:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
to maintain the high degree of
 
05:29:41.230 --> 05:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
reliability that we've been able to uh
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
enjoy and serve in this region um
 
05:29:46.230 --> 05:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
particularly as we further Electrify
 
05:29:48.830 --> 05:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
broader segments of the economy and it
 
05:29:51.150 --> 05:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
becomes a more important societal issue
 
05:29:54.548 --> 05:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
to maintain that reliability
 
05:29:57.670 --> 05:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
overall follow up yeah so that thank you
 
05:29:59.868 --> 05:29:59.878 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh Mr chair so
 
05:30:01.750 --> 05:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
that you know brings up the obvious
 
05:30:03.110 --> 05:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
question what are the bottlenecks to
 
05:30:05.110 --> 05:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
05:30:08.350 --> 05:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
happens the the two most fundamental are
 
05:30:13.110 --> 05:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
sighting and financing and uh right now
 
05:30:16.310 --> 05:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh the the sighting is um predominantly
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the control of the individual states
 
05:30:21.350 --> 05:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
and we are seeing movement uh in across
 
05:30:23.670 --> 05:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
a number of New England states to try
 
05:30:26.830 --> 05:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
and um either streamline or at least
 
05:30:29.788 --> 05:30:29.798 align:start position:0%
facilitate a more timely consideration
 
05:30:32.110 --> 05:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
of large scale Projects New Hampshire
 
05:30:34.910 --> 05:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
went through a major uh reform of of its
 
05:30:37.230 --> 05:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
citing statute several years ago and I
 
05:30:39.310 --> 05:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
know um much more recently that has
 
05:30:41.990 --> 05:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
become uh uh reemerged as a topic of
 
05:30:44.110 --> 05:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
Interest we would be very interested in
 
05:30:46.670 --> 05:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
in having that conversation with you all
 
05:30:48.670 --> 05:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh there was a major piece of
 
05:30:50.150 --> 05:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
legislation signed into law in
 
05:30:52.430 --> 05:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts just uh about six weeks
 
05:30:55.708 --> 05:30:55.718 align:start position:0%
ago um that uh I think is a major step
 
05:30:58.350 --> 05:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
forward there and my hope is that we see
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
that translated in in other states uh
 
05:31:04.350 --> 05:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
the the I think the most fundamental
 
05:31:06.670 --> 05:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
challenge that we have in New Hampshire
 
05:31:09.430 --> 05:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
and unique to New England is uh this
 
05:31:13.150 --> 05:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
tension between local control and
 
05:31:17.948 --> 05:31:17.958 align:start position:0%
Statewide societal needs um the the uh
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
the the government structure of town
 
05:31:21.948 --> 05:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
meeting is a remarkable and I think
 
05:31:25.390 --> 05:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
unique aspect to New England governance
 
05:31:27.750 --> 05:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
it makes it hard to build
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
multi-community large scale
 
05:31:31.470 --> 05:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects whether that's
 
05:31:34.948 --> 05:31:34.958 align:start position:0%
energy or anything else um and so part
 
05:31:36.670 --> 05:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
of the tension that that we have is how
 
05:31:39.190 --> 05:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
do we maintain local control and
 
05:31:41.430 --> 05:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
recognition of the the challenges and
 
05:31:44.030 --> 05:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
the benefits that can acur to a host
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
Community while still making sure that
 
05:31:49.510 --> 05:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
we're creating an environment in which
 
05:31:52.470 --> 05:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
these large manufacturing industrial
 
05:31:55.788 --> 05:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
facilities can get built and cited that
 
05:31:58.548 --> 05:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
serve a much wider population base I
 
05:32:00.270 --> 05:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
don't have a silver bullet answer but
 
05:32:02.910 --> 05:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
that's a tension that that we Face the
 
05:32:05.910 --> 05:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
second is that financing piece is uh how
 
05:32:09.270 --> 05:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
do we pay for it and right now uh New
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
England wide and and commissioner jatai
 
05:32:14.230 --> 05:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
um uh spoke a little bit to this we are
 
05:32:16.750 --> 05:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
in the midst of a multi-year effort to
 
05:32:19.350 --> 05:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
do the most fundamental redesign of our
 
05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity markets to more
 
05:32:24.990 --> 05:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
sharply account and accredit for what
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
individual resources are actually
 
05:32:29.230 --> 05:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
providing for reliability and paying
 
05:32:32.070 --> 05:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
them for it and those that are not
 
05:32:34.548 --> 05:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it's been a long time coming
 
05:32:36.670 --> 05:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
and we're getting there um and our hope
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
is that over the next 18 to 24 months we
 
05:32:42.270 --> 05:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
have a much more granular and sharply
 
05:32:44.990 --> 05:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
focused Market design that can help uh
 
05:32:47.270 --> 05:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
get that financing done so that we can
 
05:32:50.070 --> 05:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
build uh uh those new resources coming
 
05:32:51.910 --> 05:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
in but the way that the electricity
 
05:32:54.470 --> 05:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
Market is designed is for the most
 
05:32:58.910 --> 05:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
economical resource to be built and um
 
05:33:02.030 --> 05:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
and right now that does not account for
 
05:33:04.590 --> 05:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
certain uh environmental or climate
 
05:33:06.628 --> 05:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
attributes and to the degree an
 
05:33:09.548 --> 05:33:09.558 align:start position:0%
individual State wants those uh that's
 
05:33:11.670 --> 05:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
where we also see now attention of
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
States um adding additional funding or
 
05:33:16.350 --> 05:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
subsidies for individual resources
 
05:33:18.430 --> 05:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
because they're not being called for
 
05:33:22.190 --> 05:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:25.430 --> 05:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
itself representative Corman thank you
 
05:33:28.350 --> 05:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you both for coming uh
 
05:33:30.350 --> 05:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
you actually spurred my thought about
 
05:33:33.310 --> 05:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
two questions so uh I'm wondering about
 
05:33:35.868 --> 05:33:35.878 align:start position:0%
the interconnection cue and what sort of
 
05:33:38.670 --> 05:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
obstacle that poses for the G generators
 
05:33:40.390 --> 05:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
but also just as I look through here I
 
05:33:42.110 --> 05:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
didn't see anything about
 
05:33:44.628 --> 05:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
storage and uh of course Schiller and
 
05:33:46.868 --> 05:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
marac station are are going to become
 
05:33:49.350 --> 05:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
predominantly storage Sher entirely
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
marac combines solar and storage and
 
05:33:53.590 --> 05:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
also I'm thinking about the form energy
 
05:33:55.590 --> 05:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
project up in Maine which is going to be
 
05:33:57.990 --> 05:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of storage and I know
 
05:34:00.270 --> 05:34:00.280 align:start position:0%
technically that's not generation but it
 
05:34:03.670 --> 05:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
is putting stuff onto the grid and uh
 
05:34:05.628 --> 05:34:05.638 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering how that fits into
 
05:34:07.868 --> 05:34:07.878 align:start position:0%
what you folks do
 
05:34:09.548 --> 05:34:09.558 align:start position:0%
sure so I'll take the second one first
 
05:34:11.590 --> 05:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
on on the storage side I I actually
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
don't look it look at it as as
 
05:34:16.868 --> 05:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
incremental I look at it as moving uh
 
05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
generation from one period of time to
 
05:34:21.270 --> 05:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
another um some have have turned it a
 
05:34:23.868 --> 05:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
time machine in that respect and it can
 
05:34:25.788 --> 05:34:25.798 align:start position:0%
create efficiencies on the system in
 
05:34:27.548 --> 05:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
which there are periods of time in which
 
05:34:30.310 --> 05:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
we have excess generation and move them
 
05:34:32.510 --> 05:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
that that generation to then a period of
 
05:34:34.470 --> 05:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
time of higher demand so there is a
 
05:34:38.190 --> 05:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous value of of storage overall
 
05:34:41.830 --> 05:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
um the the fundamental um issue that we
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
have uh with storage is that that
 
05:34:48.708 --> 05:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
overall duration um where I think right
 
05:34:50.830 --> 05:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
now the the fastest growing segment of
 
05:34:55.750 --> 05:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
storage are 2 to 4our length batteries
 
05:34:58.868 --> 05:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
that are um tremendously valuable of Mo
 
05:35:01.110 --> 05:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
moving power within a day I I think of
 
05:35:02.868 --> 05:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
them as kind of an
 
05:35:05.868 --> 05:35:05.878 align:start position:0%
intraday help uh of taking from certain
 
05:35:07.150 --> 05:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
portions of the day and pushing it to
 
05:35:10.590 --> 05:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
others the the the most simple way in my
 
05:35:13.310 --> 05:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
mind is take it from you know 2 o'clock
 
05:35:15.270 --> 05:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon when uh the sun is
 
05:35:17.990 --> 05:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
shining bright brightest move it to 7 or
 
05:35:20.230 --> 05:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
8 o'clock at night as as we see that
 
05:35:22.150 --> 05:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
evening ramp up and the Sun is going
 
05:35:25.350 --> 05:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
down um I think fundamentally from a
 
05:35:27.390 --> 05:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
reliability standpoint the biggest
 
05:35:30.150 --> 05:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
challenge in New England going forward
 
05:35:32.470 --> 05:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
are going to be those multi-day cold
 
05:35:35.030 --> 05:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
snaps particularly as we bring in more
 
05:35:37.430 --> 05:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
heat pumps higher electricity loads in
 
05:35:41.590 --> 05:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
the winter months uh in which we um uh
 
05:35:43.350 --> 05:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
see some of this the constraints on the
 
05:35:45.150 --> 05:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
fuel delivery system
 
05:35:48.430 --> 05:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
overall H how do we deal with day five
 
05:35:50.590 --> 05:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
six or seven of a 10-day cold snap in
 
05:35:52.510 --> 05:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
which there's six inches of snow on on
 
05:35:54.670 --> 05:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
top of a lot of the solar panels and it
 
05:35:58.470 --> 05:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
just is one of those still wind days um
 
05:36:01.270 --> 05:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
that that's really cold that is where
 
05:36:04.788 --> 05:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
multi-day storage systems could be Tre
 
05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
tremendously um beneficial the the form
 
05:36:09.990 --> 05:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
energy project uh up in Lincoln Maine is
 
05:36:13.390 --> 05:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
a proposal for a 100h hour battery um
 
05:36:16.670 --> 05:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
that obviously um is is very exciting
 
05:36:19.788 --> 05:36:19.798 align:start position:0%
and and creates some real opportunity I
 
05:36:22.270 --> 05:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
will say like small modular reactors we
 
05:36:25.110 --> 05:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
haven't seen one yet and so it's it's
 
05:36:28.430 --> 05:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
hard to really say um exactly what that
 
05:36:30.510 --> 05:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
impact is going to be or to what degree
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
that is scalable or replicable um
 
05:36:36.510 --> 05:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
overall but yes that is um a a really
 
05:36:38.190 --> 05:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
important um piece
 
05:36:41.788 --> 05:36:41.798 align:start position:0%
on the interconnection side that is a
 
05:36:43.708 --> 05:36:43.718 align:start position:0%
very difficult issue I will say we have
 
05:36:47.590 --> 05:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
seen improvements um at ISO New England
 
05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
um uh particularly with respect to
 
05:36:51.750 --> 05:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
clustering and being able to model
 
05:36:53.708 --> 05:36:53.718 align:start position:0%
multiple projects at once and not just
 
05:36:56.270 --> 05:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
go project by project that being said
 
05:36:58.110 --> 05:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
this is always going to be a frustrating
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
period in which there are bottlenecks on
 
05:37:03.270 --> 05:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
mapping that system overall um which is
 
05:37:06.990 --> 05:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
where we have frankly um pushed more on
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
um uh on making sure that state citing
 
05:37:13.590 --> 05:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
statutes um uh can be done as quickly as
 
05:37:15.628 --> 05:37:15.638 align:start position:0%
possible so that when a project does get
 
05:37:17.670 --> 05:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
through that that interconnection uh
 
05:37:20.150 --> 05:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
study at ISO New England we're ready to
 
05:37:21.670 --> 05:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
move and and move forward so I know
 
05:37:23.750 --> 05:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's not an entirely satisfying answer
 
05:37:25.548 --> 05:37:25.558 align:start position:0%
on on the interconnection side but it
 
05:37:26.708 --> 05:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
it's a tricky
 
05:37:29.390 --> 05:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
issue representative Matson has a
 
05:37:31.470 --> 05:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
question I was just wondering do you
 
05:37:34.350 --> 05:37:34.360 align:start position:0%
know how many megawatt hour of storage
 
05:37:36.708 --> 05:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
we have right now in New Hampshire I
 
05:37:36.718 --> 05:37:37.990 align:start position:0%
we have right now in New Hampshire I
don't

05:37:37.990 --> 05:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:37:41.350 --> 05:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
well so we we focus a lot on lithian ion
 
05:37:43.270 --> 05:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
batteries they're the newer technology
 
05:37:44.948 --> 05:37:44.958 align:start position:0%
and I think you see a lot of that on the
 
05:37:46.990 --> 05:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
distribution system but historically
 
05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
we've actually already had a lot of
 
05:37:50.948 --> 05:37:50.958 align:start position:0%
storage facilities on the grid in the
 
05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
terms of um um Hydro pumped hydro store
 
05:37:57.350 --> 05:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
power so there are two large facilities
 
05:37:59.230 --> 05:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
one in western Mass and one in
 
05:38:01.070 --> 05:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
Conneticut both M they're both in
 
05:38:03.150 --> 05:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I've only been to one and
 
05:38:05.510 --> 05:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
they are one is about what 8,000
 
05:38:08.310 --> 05:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
megawatts and the other is 10 or am I
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
one is three oh I'm way off yeah I need
 
05:38:15.070 --> 05:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
to drop a zero anyway they're probably a
 
05:38:17.270 --> 05:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
combination of 2 or 3,000 megawatts and
 
05:38:19.150 --> 05:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
they're at the top of a mountain um on a
 
05:38:20.990 --> 05:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
river and so they can pump water to the
 
05:38:23.470 --> 05:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
top of the mountain and hold it in a
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
pond and when the when the grid needs
 
05:38:28.750 --> 05:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
electricity um the water goes down the
 
05:38:30.110 --> 05:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
mountain and Spins the turbine in the
 
05:38:31.948 --> 05:38:31.958 align:start position:0%
other way and so historically we've
 
05:38:33.430 --> 05:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
actually had a lot of storage I think
 
05:38:34.948 --> 05:38:34.958 align:start position:0%
the question is what about the batteries
 
05:38:37.468 --> 05:38:37.478 align:start position:0%
that are made out of lithian I you know
 
05:38:38.708 --> 05:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
I think we're seeing a lot of investment
 
05:38:41.070 --> 05:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
on the distribution system I think um in
 
05:38:42.788 --> 05:38:42.798 align:start position:0%
terms of resilience and supporting
 
05:38:44.548 --> 05:38:44.558 align:start position:0%
communities maybe after a storm is where
 
05:38:46.468 --> 05:38:46.478 align:start position:0%
you see a lot of investment in that I
 
05:38:48.868 --> 05:38:48.878 align:start position:0%
think in this in terms of the wholesale
 
05:38:50.830 --> 05:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
electricity markets where you have
 
05:38:55.390 --> 05:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
larger larger resources um you um you
 
05:38:57.830 --> 05:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
see I think a a good chunk of the iso
 
05:39:00.910 --> 05:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
New England Q is battery storage I but I
 
05:39:02.390 --> 05:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
I think it would be in the thousands but
 
05:39:04.350 --> 05:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
those are what's being proposed in terms
 
05:39:05.628 --> 05:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
of what's actually on the grid it's
 
05:39:09.230 --> 05:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:09.240 --> 05:39:10.868 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:39:10.868 --> 05:39:10.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:39:13.070 --> 05:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chairman turning
 
05:39:16.350 --> 05:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
to slide five you have 800% increase in
 
05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
transmission rates since 2004 what's the
 
05:39:22.948 --> 05:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
Big Driver of that and what can we do to
 
05:39:27.230 --> 05:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:29.628 --> 05:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
bit this is our favorite slide and the
 
05:39:32.030 --> 05:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
one that gets the most attention um and
 
05:39:36.270 --> 05:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
and and truly it it is put here not as
 
05:39:38.830 --> 05:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh an advocate for a specific policy or
 
05:39:40.788 --> 05:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
a direct answer because it is a really
 
05:39:44.270 --> 05:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
complicated answer right our job is to
 
05:39:47.788 --> 05:39:47.798 align:start position:0%
produce electrons that that then we
 
05:39:50.910 --> 05:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
require transmission to move to to the
 
05:39:53.750 --> 05:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
market to get to our customer base uh
 
05:39:57.708 --> 05:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
and uh New England unsurprisingly has an
 
05:39:59.670 --> 05:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
old transmission and distribution
 
05:40:01.150 --> 05:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
Network and it does need to be
 
05:40:05.110 --> 05:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
reinvested in and and kept up this is
 
05:40:07.628 --> 05:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
largely put on this slide because we
 
05:40:08.990 --> 05:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
also know that one of the biggest
 
05:40:11.110 --> 05:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
pressures you all feel as the
 
05:40:13.750 --> 05:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
representatives of your constituents is
 
05:40:15.868 --> 05:40:15.878 align:start position:0%
what's going on in my electric bill why
 
05:40:18.788 --> 05:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
is the price what it is and to recognize
 
05:40:20.948 --> 05:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
that the production of electricity like
 
05:40:22.868 --> 05:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
on the prior slide is a volatile
 
05:40:25.230 --> 05:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
commodity and we see that go up and down
 
05:40:26.628 --> 05:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
uh year to year and it tends to be the
 
05:40:29.670 --> 05:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
sharpest mover uh we also don't want to
 
05:40:32.510 --> 05:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
ignore the Frog getting boiled in the
 
05:40:34.788 --> 05:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
pot of water slowly over time with
 
05:40:36.990 --> 05:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
increasing temperatures and that's
 
05:40:38.708 --> 05:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
really what we're seeing on on the
 
05:40:40.708 --> 05:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
transmission side I will say from a
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
policy standpoint it I believe
 
05:40:47.230 --> 05:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
personally it is the result of of two um
 
05:40:49.390 --> 05:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh well-intentioned policies that had
 
05:40:51.868 --> 05:40:51.878 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences the first is
 
05:40:55.110 --> 05:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
that in 2005 Congress passed the uh
 
05:40:58.350 --> 05:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
energy Policy Act of 2005 that created
 
05:41:02.868 --> 05:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
an explicit um uh increased Revenue uh
 
05:41:05.190 --> 05:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for largescale transmission
 
05:41:07.788 --> 05:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
development by utilities it is the
 
05:41:09.910 --> 05:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
national policy of the United States to
 
05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
build more transmission to farther and
 
05:41:14.628 --> 05:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
farther flung places largely to
 
05:41:18.190 --> 05:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
interconnect both populations but with
 
05:41:22.230 --> 05:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
um uh sources that produce lots of wind
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
lots of solar and even um uh uh the gas
 
05:41:28.910 --> 05:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
fields building a gas plant right on top
 
05:41:30.350 --> 05:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
of the gas fields and then moving that
 
05:41:32.670 --> 05:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
gas by wire uh through electricity so
 
05:41:36.030 --> 05:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
one is uh uh guaranteed High rates of
 
05:41:37.230 --> 05:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
return for building that transmiss
 
05:41:39.548 --> 05:41:39.558 align:start position:0%
Mission and like any rational economic
 
05:41:40.868 --> 05:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
actor you're you're going to put that
 
05:41:44.030 --> 05:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
money in in in place there the second is
 
05:41:45.830 --> 05:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've gotten the utilities out of the
 
05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
business of owning and operating power
 
05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
plants and so the only place for them to
 
05:41:53.270 --> 05:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
make money is on improvements to the
 
05:41:55.468 --> 05:41:55.478 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution system
 
05:41:58.030 --> 05:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
overall and again that's their job they
 
05:42:00.390 --> 05:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
should do that um but overall it is
 
05:42:02.510 --> 05:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
creating an economic incentive to
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
further focus in those areas which is
 
05:42:07.190 --> 05:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
why New England pays the highest rate of
 
05:42:09.030 --> 05:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
Wholesale Transmission of any Market in
 
05:42:14.030 --> 05:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:16.110 --> 05:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
States okay is there anything else you
 
05:42:19.548 --> 05:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
would like to tell us about your
 
05:42:21.948 --> 05:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
presentation so the only other one and I
 
05:42:23.708 --> 05:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
know chairman in particular this has
 
05:42:25.990 --> 05:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
been an interest of uh of yours coming
 
05:42:28.468 --> 05:42:28.478 align:start position:0%
into this this session in particular um
 
05:42:31.070 --> 05:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
but do want to highlight slide 11 here
 
05:42:33.270 --> 05:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
um with respect to to Electric
 
05:42:36.430 --> 05:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
reliability uh as I said earlier uh
 
05:42:40.030 --> 05:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
Electric reliability is clearly our our
 
05:42:43.670 --> 05:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
top priority um however it is not the
 
05:42:47.390 --> 05:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
only one and uh the other overused uh
 
05:42:49.030 --> 05:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
phrase that that we have is in this
 
05:42:50.628 --> 05:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
industry is that it's a three-legged
 
05:42:53.670 --> 05:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
stool we have affordability we have
 
05:42:55.990 --> 05:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
reliability and we have trying to do it
 
05:42:59.590 --> 05:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
increasingly clean and uh the the trick
 
05:43:01.390 --> 05:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
is I can
 
05:43:03.948 --> 05:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
largely provide you policy answers for
 
05:43:06.350 --> 05:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
getting two out of three of those
 
05:43:08.468 --> 05:43:08.478 align:start position:0%
getting all three at once is really
 
05:43:11.350 --> 05:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
really hard and right now what we are
 
05:43:13.990 --> 05:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
seeing is as electricity demand
 
05:43:16.350 --> 05:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
continues to increase as we see some of
 
05:43:18.430 --> 05:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
the older facilities that either need
 
05:43:20.270 --> 05:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
reinvestment or just have reached the
 
05:43:23.830 --> 05:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
end of their useful life go away how do
 
05:43:26.468 --> 05:43:26.478 align:start position:0%
we make sure that that reliability stool
 
05:43:29.750 --> 05:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
is maintained and that has become under
 
05:43:32.468 --> 05:43:32.478 align:start position:0%
um uh even more attention and and
 
05:43:34.670 --> 05:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
tension and pressure as we see not only
 
05:43:36.548 --> 05:43:36.558 align:start position:0%
electrification happen at the retail
 
05:43:39.230 --> 05:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
level between individual homeowners in
 
05:43:40.948 --> 05:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
investing in their heating systems in
 
05:43:43.468 --> 05:43:43.478 align:start position:0%
their vehicles but really what we're
 
05:43:45.468 --> 05:43:45.478 align:start position:0%
seeing is in other parts of the country
 
05:43:49.030 --> 05:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
right now uh extraordinary growth in
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing onshoring of manufacturing
 
05:43:55.548 --> 05:43:55.558 align:start position:0%
and uh use of AI data centers
 
05:43:57.270 --> 05:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
particularly as we look at the
 
05:44:00.510 --> 05:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
Mid-Atlantic and Midwest extraordinary
 
05:44:02.788 --> 05:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
electricity demand that has not yet
 
05:44:04.868 --> 05:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
happened in New England but I emphasize
 
05:44:08.750 --> 05:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
yet and so what what we are um trying to
 
05:44:11.948 --> 05:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
highlight is that uh we are watching
 
05:44:15.548 --> 05:44:15.558 align:start position:0%
this we uh uh certainly are
 
05:44:18.350 --> 05:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily aware of the situation
 
05:44:20.990 --> 05:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh the the the map we have here and and
 
05:44:23.310 --> 05:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
recognize it's kind of small here I
 
05:44:25.948 --> 05:44:25.958 align:start position:0%
think sometimes we have a tendency and
 
05:44:27.670 --> 05:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
understandably parochially to really
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
only be worried about our sandbox to
 
05:44:31.430 --> 05:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
think that that New England's on on a
 
05:44:34.590 --> 05:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
knife edge and really um if you look at
 
05:44:36.750 --> 05:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
across the country we're in really good
 
05:44:36.760 --> 05:44:37.708 align:start position:0%
across the country we're in really good
company

05:44:37.708 --> 05:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
company
 
05:44:40.190 --> 05:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh this is a national issue uh this is
 
05:44:43.708 --> 05:44:43.718 align:start position:0%
something that uh is the top priority
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
right now as we look at a changing
 
05:44:47.350 --> 05:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
 
05:44:49.230 --> 05:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
with a a new Administration coming into
 
05:44:51.310 --> 05:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
place at the North American Electric
 
05:44:53.510 --> 05:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
reliability corporation which is the
 
05:44:56.990 --> 05:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
entity designated um for electric
 
05:44:59.628 --> 05:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
reliability uh there was also uh a
 
05:45:02.430 --> 05:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
report um where kind of the executive
 
05:45:05.030 --> 05:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
summary was just issued uh about 10 days
 
05:45:07.070 --> 05:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
ago the full report is expected next
 
05:45:09.590 --> 05:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
week There's an organization called the
 
05:45:13.548 --> 05:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
Northeast um uh p uh uh Power
 
05:45:16.468 --> 05:45:16.478 align:start position:0%
coordinating Council npcc sorry we have
 
05:45:18.830 --> 05:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
too many acronyms uh they are the
 
05:45:21.670 --> 05:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
regional entity designated by nerk to
 
05:45:24.070 --> 05:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
worry about our corner of the world all
 
05:45:27.670 --> 05:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
of them are highlighting um that uh
 
05:45:30.788 --> 05:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
reliability is concerned long term
 
05:45:33.190 --> 05:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
however I also want to stress that uh
 
05:45:36.030 --> 05:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
we're not in the red right this is an
 
05:45:40.468 --> 05:45:40.478 align:start position:0%
important serious issue we today do not
 
05:45:44.628 --> 05:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
see um an outright emergency here but we
 
05:45:46.590 --> 05:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
need to be mindful we need to Be
 
05:45:48.548 --> 05:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
watchful and and certainly that is
 
05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
something that as uh we engage with you
 
05:45:52.788 --> 05:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
all for the rest of this session is
 
05:45:55.070 --> 05:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
going to be front of Mind as as we look
 
05:45:57.590 --> 05:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
at at the very Pol various policies and
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:03.548 --> 05:46:03.558 align:start position:0%
forward well thank you very much I uh I
 
05:46:05.350 --> 05:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
have one comment and then one question
 
05:46:08.628 --> 05:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
for you the comment relates to something
 
05:46:11.628 --> 05:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
you talked about earlier small modular
 
05:46:15.628 --> 05:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
nuclear power at the end of November the
 
05:46:18.510 --> 05:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear regulatory nuclear Regulatory
 
05:46:21.270 --> 05:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
Commission granted permission to Kos
 
05:46:24.430 --> 05:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
power to build two 35 megawatt bolt and
 
05:46:29.628 --> 05:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
salt react reactors in Texas and uh I
 
05:46:33.150 --> 05:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
believe that once this small modular
 
05:46:36.070 --> 05:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactor industry gets moving
 
05:46:39.390 --> 05:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to take off very very quickly
 
05:46:43.510 --> 05:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that process has begun my
 
05:46:43.520 --> 05:46:44.590 align:start position:0%
and I think that process has begun my
question

05:46:44.590 --> 05:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:46:47.230 --> 05:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
though uh relates
 
05:46:50.510 --> 05:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
to since you do a lot of your work in
 
05:46:52.990 --> 05:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts you also mentioned earlier
 
05:46:54.830 --> 05:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts six weeks ago passed
 
05:46:56.868 --> 05:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
into new energy
 
05:47:00.190 --> 05:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
law the Massachusetts fiscal
 
05:47:02.590 --> 05:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
Alliance pointed out that that law
 
05:47:04.628 --> 05:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
contains a requirement that the
 
05:47:08.190 --> 05:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
utilities in Massachusetts purchase 1500
 
05:47:13.468 --> 05:47:13.478 align:start position:0%
megaw of storage by July 1st of
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
2025 and at $500,000 a megawatt that
 
05:47:19.070 --> 05:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
works out to $750
 
05:47:22.110 --> 05:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
million that Massachusetts utilities are
 
05:47:23.830 --> 05:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
going to have to spend between now and
 
05:47:29.230 --> 05:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:33.948 --> 05:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:36.310 --> 05:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
know how can this possibly be a good
 
05:47:38.750 --> 05:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
idea I just what were they thinking I
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know any uh further
 
05:47:44.110 --> 05:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:47:46.110 --> 05:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
partial thank you chair it's good to see
 
05:47:48.670 --> 05:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
you both thank you for coming um my
 
05:47:50.350 --> 05:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
question is also about batteries and we
 
05:47:53.070 --> 05:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
tend to look at a large scale um
 
05:47:54.628 --> 05:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
megawatt range of what we need to
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
produce when it comes to batteries um is
 
05:47:59.390 --> 05:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
there have there been develops upon
 
05:48:02.590 --> 05:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
micro I I hasate the word micr GD but
 
05:48:04.910 --> 05:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
smaller batteries such as you already
 
05:48:06.830 --> 05:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
have that would meet your two to four
 
05:48:09.708 --> 05:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
hour demand for being able to time shift
 
05:48:12.350 --> 05:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
and could you speak to that a bit sure
 
05:48:14.030 --> 05:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
and that is where we've seen the the
 
05:48:17.190 --> 05:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
large scale growth and in fact I think
 
05:48:20.350 --> 05:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
just about every one of our um uh
 
05:48:23.990 --> 05:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
members is looking to or has already put
 
05:48:26.430 --> 05:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
batteries behind the fence line at their
 
05:48:28.670 --> 05:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
power plant itself to optimize the the
 
05:48:31.190 --> 05:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
fuel use and take advantage of when they
 
05:48:32.708 --> 05:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
have opportunities to produce
 
05:48:35.868 --> 05:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
electricity at a lower cost store it and
 
05:48:38.990 --> 05:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
then put it on to the the the Grid in in
 
05:48:40.628 --> 05:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
moments in which either they are
 
05:48:43.590 --> 05:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
constrained from a fuel perspective uh
 
05:48:47.110 --> 05:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
an air permit um perspective or in which
 
05:48:49.270 --> 05:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's just cheaper to to discharge that
 
05:48:51.390 --> 05:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
battery so absolutely there there's a
 
05:48:53.788 --> 05:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
huge role for those shorter duration
 
05:48:56.910 --> 05:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
batteries I I just wanted to to temper
 
05:48:59.150 --> 05:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
um uh some of the the potential
 
05:49:01.990 --> 05:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
expectations of how much are we going to
 
05:49:04.110 --> 05:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
be able to to lean on that to to Really
 
05:49:07.310 --> 05:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
solve our our issues overall the other
 
05:49:12.390 --> 05:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
area that um I I think is um to come in
 
05:49:15.510 --> 05:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
in New England is to what degree we see
 
05:49:18.150 --> 05:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh distributed batteries in the home or
 
05:49:22.110 --> 05:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
in the business aggregated at scale and
 
05:49:24.190 --> 05:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
then be able to participate as was
 
05:49:27.310 --> 05:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned um by the the Pu Commissioners
 
05:49:29.070 --> 05:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
either from a demand response
 
05:49:31.830 --> 05:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
perspective or the the other kind of
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
topic dour these days is what are called
 
05:49:36.708 --> 05:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
virtual power plants which are this
 
05:49:39.150 --> 05:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
aggregated Demand aggregated Storage
 
05:49:41.030 --> 05:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
that that then is is scalable there
 
05:49:42.750 --> 05:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
there have been pilot projects including
 
05:49:45.628 --> 05:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um doing that I I
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
think that's uh an exciting interesting
 
05:49:50.948 --> 05:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
um place to to further develop and is
 
05:49:53.830 --> 05:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
also this marriage between the retail
 
05:49:56.190 --> 05:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory side that the Pu over
 
05:49:58.430 --> 05:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
oversees with that distribution and
 
05:50:01.030 --> 05:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
homeowner um participation and the whole
 
05:50:01.040 --> 05:50:05.430 align:start position:0%
homeowner um participation and the whole
sale

05:50:05.430 --> 05:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:07.708 --> 05:50:07.718 align:start position:0%
Market okay I want to thank you both
 
05:50:09.670 --> 05:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
both for being here excellent
 
05:50:12.510 --> 05:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
presentation very informative and uh a
 
05:50:14.270 --> 05:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
good discussion as
 
05:50:17.468 --> 05:50:17.478 align:start position:0%
well so that concludes our presentation
 
05:50:20.670 --> 05:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
portion of today's activity we are now
 
05:50:23.270 --> 05:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
going to resume some of the orientation
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
activity that we didn't get to earlier
 
05:50:29.230 --> 05:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
today this morning when we started our
 
05:50:33.310 --> 05:50:33.320 align:start position:0%
orientation we talked about General um
 
05:50:36.430 --> 05:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
committee organizational issues but I
 
05:50:37.548 --> 05:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
think I think
 
05:50:40.788 --> 05:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
it's important to talk about the two
 
05:50:44.708 --> 05:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
activities in which we primarily engage
 
05:50:47.350 --> 05:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
one is public hearing of bills and two
 
05:50:50.750 --> 05:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
is executive sessions of bills so I'm
 
05:50:53.948 --> 05:50:53.958 align:start position:0%
going to turn the um discussion over to
 
05:50:58.948 --> 05:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
my vice chair representative Thomas to
 
05:51:03.510 --> 05:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
discuss public hearings how we do them
 
05:51:06.670 --> 05:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
and what's important in a public hearing
 
05:51:08.948 --> 05:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
and then after he's done representative
 
05:51:10.628 --> 05:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
Bernardi is going to talk about
 
05:51:13.628 --> 05:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
executive sessions how we conduct those
 
05:51:15.788 --> 05:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
and what's important to know about those
 
05:51:18.590 --> 05:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
so representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:51:22.110 --> 05:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
chairman uh first I'd like to say
 
05:51:25.350 --> 05:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
that every committee will run
 
05:51:28.510 --> 05:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
differently based on the Chairman's
 
05:51:30.708 --> 05:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
personality and way that he would like
 
05:51:34.110 --> 05:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
to run a meeting so what what we may do
 
05:51:36.070 --> 05:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
here may be a little bit different than
 
05:51:38.390 --> 05:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
what you may see or experience in in
 
05:51:41.230 --> 05:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
other committees but there are certain
 
05:51:43.150 --> 05:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
basic guidelines that every committee
 
05:51:46.150 --> 05:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
will follow and that's what that's kind
 
05:51:49.548 --> 05:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
of what we'll You Know cover here um I
 
05:51:52.070 --> 05:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
guess the Golden Rule with any public
 
05:51:53.270 --> 05:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and this is really for the
 
05:51:55.670 --> 05:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
benefit of the of of our new members but
 
05:51:58.510 --> 05:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
as a reminder to our returning members
 
05:52:01.590 --> 05:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
that uh there may be times when a
 
05:52:04.628 --> 05:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
particular issue um is very passionate
 
05:52:08.070 --> 05:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
to you and you may may or may not want
 
05:52:10.350 --> 05:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
to bring out certain points during
 
05:52:13.788 --> 05:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
testimony of public hearing uh
 
05:52:19.830 --> 05:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
our our uh way of doing things is to ask
 
05:52:22.948 --> 05:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
questions that will bring out the facts
 
05:52:25.468 --> 05:52:25.478 align:start position:0%
or the clarity of what is being
 
05:52:29.310 --> 05:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
discussed as it pertains to the bill in
 
05:52:33.110 --> 05:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
question and so we don't engage in any
 
05:52:37.070 --> 05:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
debate with the testifier um sometimes
 
05:52:40.990 --> 05:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
there may be a tendency to a to you ask
 
05:52:42.948 --> 05:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
one question they have a response and
 
05:52:44.310 --> 05:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you feel like asking a
 
05:52:45.430 --> 05:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
second one and all of a sudden you're
 
05:52:48.310 --> 05:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
going back and forth well the chair will
 
05:52:51.030 --> 05:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
regulate that but I would I I would say
 
05:52:53.670 --> 05:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
that make sure your questions are
 
05:52:57.430 --> 05:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
phrased so that you get the information
 
05:53:00.150 --> 05:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
that you want and not subject to two or
 
05:53:03.150 --> 05:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
three follow-ups uh with only one word
 
05:53:05.868 --> 05:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
answers so we want to make sure that
 
05:53:07.510 --> 05:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
those questions
 
05:53:10.948 --> 05:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh just speak to the bill itself not to
 
05:53:15.030 --> 05:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
the ideology in general but to what that
 
05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill is supposed to be doing so if you
 
05:53:20.670 --> 05:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
can keep that in mind and in conjunction
 
05:53:24.190 --> 05:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
with that when you do ask a question we
 
05:53:28.670 --> 05:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
want you to ask a question we don't want
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
a 15 20 second 30 second 40 second uh
 
05:53:37.070 --> 05:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
dissertation speech on your feelings on
 
05:53:40.230 --> 05:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
the bill um and then uh have to be
 
05:53:43.070 --> 05:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
reminded where where is the question so
 
05:53:45.708 --> 05:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
please when you raise your hand be ready
 
05:53:49.230 --> 05:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
to ask the question and hopefully
 
05:53:52.468 --> 05:53:52.478 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully it never begins with
 
05:53:53.910 --> 05:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
would you
 
05:53:57.150 --> 05:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
believe um so uh those are some of the
 
05:53:59.430 --> 05:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
things that I'd like to point out uh to
 
05:54:04.150 --> 05:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
keep the testimonies rolling and um keep
 
05:54:05.948 --> 05:54:05.958 align:start position:0%
them of course always always being
 
05:54:08.948 --> 05:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
respect to the testifier no matter what
 
05:54:11.190 --> 05:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
they're saying uh or no matter what the
 
05:54:13.310 --> 05:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
issue is and just please form your
 
05:54:16.270 --> 05:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
questions to either bring out something
 
05:54:20.310 --> 05:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
that you feel will clarify to you or to
 
05:54:22.910 --> 05:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
the committee uh what the testfire is
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually getting
 
05:54:26.910 --> 05:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
to uh so I covered think the thing about
 
05:54:31.628 --> 05:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
speeches no speeches oh yes um questions
 
05:54:34.868 --> 05:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
first of all I'll say this rather
 
05:54:37.708 --> 05:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
bluntly nobody speaks until they're
 
05:54:40.750 --> 05:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
recognized by the chair and you get
 
05:54:43.110 --> 05:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
recognized by The Chair by raising your
 
05:54:46.390 --> 05:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
hand and in some
 
05:54:49.110 --> 05:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
cases you're waving like this so that
 
05:54:51.590 --> 05:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
the chair can see you past
 
05:54:53.468 --> 05:54:53.478 align:start position:0%
me I'm
 
05:54:56.030 --> 05:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
kidding yes some some some of us are
 
05:54:58.230 --> 05:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
being blocked by people straight up yeah
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
straight up you know or or e or so
 
05:55:03.390 --> 05:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
because sometimes like this uh he's not
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
going to see it so
 
05:55:09.468 --> 05:55:09.478 align:start position:0%
anyway yes this is a question on that
 
05:55:11.590 --> 05:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for thank you for the
 
05:55:14.310 --> 05:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
question by the way um when I see people
 
05:55:15.948 --> 05:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
over here trying to get your attention
 
05:55:19.110 --> 05:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
do you mind if I just raise my hand even
 
05:55:21.230 --> 05:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
if I don't have a question that's to
 
05:55:22.910 --> 05:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
call it I I don't want to be imposing
 
05:55:25.150 --> 05:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
her I don't I I don't have a problem
 
05:55:27.468 --> 05:55:27.478 align:start position:0%
with that sometimes I will raise my hand
 
05:55:28.868 --> 05:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
for the chair because he hasn't seen the
 
05:55:31.350 --> 05:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
person over there but but but you know
 
05:55:34.510 --> 05:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
that's obviously you know okay thank you
 
05:55:36.430 --> 05:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
and then then you can say no it's not me
 
05:55:36.440 --> 05:55:37.750 align:start position:0%
and then then you can say no it's not me
is

05:55:37.750 --> 05:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:55:40.708 --> 05:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
her so um but yeah it's a good point cuz
 
05:55:42.788 --> 05:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
we do have it's kind of limited seing
 
05:55:45.110 --> 05:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
here it is hard to see visibility is
 
05:55:47.628 --> 05:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
restricted along this table yes I didn't
 
05:55:50.110 --> 05:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
see Lex earlier this morning because he
 
05:55:51.990 --> 05:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
was hidden behind everybody else between
 
05:55:56.670 --> 05:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
me and him so so um so uh you going on
 
05:56:01.110 --> 05:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
and um oh by the way um uh if you think
 
05:56:03.830 --> 05:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
you'll have a followon question please
 
05:56:06.430 --> 05:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
ask permission again from the chair for
 
05:56:08.190 --> 05:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
a follow on instead of just blurting it
 
05:56:12.310 --> 05:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
out that helps too um when the sponsor
 
05:56:15.150 --> 05:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
is a member of the committee uh from
 
05:56:17.910 --> 05:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
what we are being told this year I know
 
05:56:19.150 --> 05:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
it might have been different before in
 
05:56:22.468 --> 05:56:22.478 align:start position:0%
the past but if you are a sponsor or if
 
05:56:25.670 --> 05:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
your name is a on the bill as a
 
05:56:28.670 --> 05:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor you may and you are in this
 
05:56:30.868 --> 05:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
committee and it's your bill you're a
 
05:56:34.548 --> 05:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of of that bill then you may
 
05:56:37.230 --> 05:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
get up and you may testify
 
05:56:40.868 --> 05:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
on that bill but then you are to return
 
05:56:44.670 --> 05:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
here and you are not to ask any more
 
05:56:46.868 --> 05:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
questions uh on any of the other
 
05:56:49.270 --> 05:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
testifiers that that that come
 
05:56:53.510 --> 05:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
up and that yes the hand is raised so so
 
05:56:56.070 --> 05:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that we're clear on
 
05:56:59.190 --> 05:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
this suppose I'm a co-sponsor on a bill
 
05:57:02.548 --> 05:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
and I do not testify then I may ask
 
05:57:06.350 --> 05:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions no
 
05:57:08.468 --> 05:57:08.478 align:start position:0%
to that question is yes you can ask
 
05:57:10.868 --> 05:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
questions if you do not testify but if
 
05:57:13.230 --> 05:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
you testify you return to your seat and
 
05:57:15.270 --> 05:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
then you can't ask questions very good
 
05:57:18.150 --> 05:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so just
 
05:57:18.160 --> 05:57:20.990 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so just

05:57:30.150 --> 05:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you if you are slated to
 
05:57:33.830 --> 05:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
testify May you ask questions before you
 
05:57:36.390 --> 05:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
testify or is it a if you are going to
 
05:57:39.430 --> 05:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
testify or did testify you you don't get
 
05:57:42.150 --> 05:57:42.160 align:start position:0%

with your name on it then I won't let
 
05:57:45.030 --> 05:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
you ask a
 
05:57:47.390 --> 05:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
question okay so it's yes if you're
 
05:57:48.948 --> 05:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
going to testify then you are not a
 
05:57:50.468 --> 05:57:50.478 align:start position:0%
questioner cor and if you don't have a
 
05:57:52.670 --> 05:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
pink card you don't testify so you might
 
05:57:54.750 --> 05:57:54.760 align:start position:0%

a good example be where from who who you
 
05:58:15.590 --> 05:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
representing and what your and do you
 
05:58:18.230 --> 05:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
support the bill yes no or neutral
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
whatever um please do it up front early
 
05:58:27.670 --> 05:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
because um the chair uh will take the
 
05:58:30.788 --> 05:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
pink cards before the testifying begins
 
05:58:32.670 --> 05:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
and he will arrange them and he will
 
05:58:35.030 --> 05:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
also figure out how many we have and how
 
05:58:38.030 --> 05:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
many minutes he may have to allow for
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
the the testifying if um if we only get
 
05:58:43.868 --> 05:58:43.878 align:start position:0%
two or three um uh pink sheets or pink
 
05:58:46.628 --> 05:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
cards up front and then with you know at
 
05:58:49.150 --> 05:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
the very very end all of a sudden we get
 
05:58:51.948 --> 05:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
six more pink cards why that might
 
05:58:54.150 --> 05:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
affect the timing of of the testifier
 
05:58:55.548 --> 05:58:55.558 align:start position:0%
and the amount of time that people may
 
05:58:57.868 --> 05:58:57.878 align:start position:0%
have time to actually testify so please
 
05:59:00.350 --> 05:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
put your pink card card in first and if
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
you if you think you might but you're
 
05:59:05.468 --> 05:59:05.478 align:start position:0%
not sure you might want to put your pink
 
05:59:07.868 --> 05:59:07.878 align:start position:0%
card in anyway and then you always wave
 
05:59:09.830 --> 05:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
off and say I've decided not to testify
 
05:59:11.430 --> 05:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
and that would save us some time as well
 
05:59:14.830 --> 05:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
I would think yes representative Thomas
 
05:59:18.150 --> 05:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um the signin sheets so if I'm
 
05:59:20.788 --> 05:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor for Bill and I sign in on
 
05:59:23.990 --> 05:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
the sheet not the pin card I can still
 
05:59:26.150 --> 05:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
ask questions as long as I don't testify
 
05:59:31.590 --> 05:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
correct correct thank you and okay any
 
05:59:34.190 --> 05:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
um and since you brought that up uh for
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the new members uh we
 
05:59:38.750 --> 05:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
have on the shelves here when we have
 
05:59:40.230 --> 05:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
testifying we have what they're called
 
05:59:42.468 --> 05:59:42.478 align:start position:0%
the Blue sheet and that's in every
 
05:59:45.390 --> 05:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
committee and if you see a bill that you
 
05:59:48.708 --> 05:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
say I'd like to say yay or nay on uh you
 
05:59:50.230 --> 05:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
certainly can just sign your name and
 
05:59:52.670 --> 05:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
say I support or I I don't support
 
05:59:54.788 --> 05:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
that's called the Blue sheet and you can
 
05:59:56.788 --> 05:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
I would uh recommend that if you see any
 
05:59:59.510 --> 05:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill that you figure feel that you need
 
06:00:01.990 --> 06:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
to voice your opinion on that just put
 
06:00:03.510 --> 06:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
your name down on that blue sheet it
 
06:00:05.788 --> 06:00:05.798 align:start position:0%
does not commit you to testify in that
 
06:00:07.708 --> 06:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
cas committee it just says that you are
 
06:00:10.590 --> 06:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
for or against a certain Bill and that's
 
06:00:12.110 --> 06:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
what that's what we mean when we say
 
06:00:16.270 --> 06:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
blue sheet yes represent n thank you we
 
06:00:19.350 --> 06:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
might want to mention that um anyone can
 
06:00:20.868 --> 06:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
look at the blue sheet but we are no
 
06:00:23.468 --> 06:00:23.478 align:start position:0%
longer required to read the names out
 
06:00:25.948 --> 06:00:25.958 align:start position:0%
loud of who signed in on the blue
 
06:00:29.310 --> 06:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
sheet true sometimes we get 20 or 30
 
06:00:33.548 --> 06:00:33.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:36.868 --> 06:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
time yes represent thank thank you uh
 
06:00:38.390 --> 06:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
also in addition to the blue sheet
 
06:00:40.830 --> 06:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
people can sign in online I don't know
 
06:00:42.350 --> 06:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
if you were going to mention that but I
 
06:00:44.548 --> 06:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
figured it's Germaine so people can sign
 
06:00:47.548 --> 06:00:47.558 align:start position:0%
in online as supporting opposing or
 
06:00:53.830 --> 06:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:57.190 --> 06:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
online do we yes go ahead representative
 
06:01:00.230 --> 06:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
not thank you do we still get a count
 
06:01:03.310 --> 06:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at you representative po um
 
06:01:04.708 --> 06:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
will we still be getting a count in
 
06:01:06.390 --> 06:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
terms of for and against because
 
06:01:07.910 --> 06:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's helpful also to know if
 
06:01:09.430 --> 06:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
the public is weighing in on a bill of
 
06:01:13.030 --> 06:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
ours I I asked that question during our
 
06:01:16.230 --> 06:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
training session and I was told that is
 
06:01:18.590 --> 06:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
no longer required to report on the
 
06:01:20.990 --> 06:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
numbers of of the blue sheet although
 
06:01:23.190 --> 06:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet will go into the record
 
06:01:27.190 --> 06:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:30.350 --> 06:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
at where's the record well it would be
 
06:01:33.628 --> 06:01:33.638 align:start position:0%
in the um uh in the in the office over
 
06:01:38.510 --> 06:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:40.910 --> 06:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
um what you mean by that you're talking
 
06:01:42.230 --> 06:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
about the
 
06:01:42.240 --> 06:01:44.590 align:start position:0%
about the
uh

06:01:44.590 --> 06:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:01:49.788 --> 06:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
session yeah good talk about that yeah
 
06:01:53.070 --> 06:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
06:01:55.468 --> 06:01:55.478 align:start position:0%
new yeah there's there's yeah there's
 
06:01:57.150 --> 06:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
something new that has come up in terms
 
06:02:00.830 --> 06:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
of um conflict of interest and Rec uh
 
06:02:04.350 --> 06:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
recusal and I think the chairman
 
06:02:08.430 --> 06:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
May so last last session we passed a
 
06:02:10.510 --> 06:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
house well we passed a bill was signed
 
06:02:12.948 --> 06:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
in law into law by the governor that
 
06:02:16.468 --> 06:02:16.478 align:start position:0%
spells out some specific situations and
 
06:02:20.230 --> 06:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
Rule changes with regards to conflicts
 
06:02:23.430 --> 06:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
of interest and
 
06:02:28.110 --> 06:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
recusal and so if you for example like I
 
06:02:30.350 --> 06:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
know representative reels used to work
 
06:02:33.868 --> 06:02:33.878 align:start position:0%
for revision revision energy he he no
 
06:02:35.910 --> 06:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
longer works there but if you were still
 
06:02:38.750 --> 06:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
working there and we had a solar bill
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
under the new um legislation that was
 
06:02:43.990 --> 06:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
passed last year you would have to
 
06:02:48.868 --> 06:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
recuse yourself from voting on that bill
 
06:02:51.390 --> 06:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
uh you could still ask questions about
 
06:02:52.868 --> 06:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
it in a in a
 
06:02:56.190 --> 06:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
hearing but um you would have to preface
 
06:03:00.310 --> 06:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
your questions by saying that um I
 
06:03:04.230 --> 06:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
recuse myself from voting on this bill
 
06:03:07.270 --> 06:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
um that probably isn't going to happen
 
06:03:09.708 --> 06:03:09.718 align:start position:0%
very often but it may happen
 
06:03:12.590 --> 06:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
occasionally so just U be thinking in
 
06:03:14.788 --> 06:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
the back of your mind whether or not
 
06:03:17.230 --> 06:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
there might ever be any conflict of
 
06:03:19.628 --> 06:03:19.638 align:start position:0%
interest between something that you're
 
06:03:21.310 --> 06:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
involved with I know some of you are
 
06:03:24.830 --> 06:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
still employed have businesses
 
06:03:26.990 --> 06:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
06:03:30.510 --> 06:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative schneller Etc uh be
 
06:03:31.948 --> 06:03:31.958 align:start position:0%
thinking in the back of your mind
 
06:03:33.390 --> 06:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not there would ever be a
 
06:03:36.270 --> 06:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest between
 
06:03:38.590 --> 06:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
your business interests and bills that
 
06:03:41.750 --> 06:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:44.150 --> 06:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee and and if that occurs
 
06:03:46.350 --> 06:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully it happens before we have
 
06:03:48.310 --> 06:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
executive session so you can inform the
 
06:03:51.868 --> 06:03:51.878 align:start position:0%
chairman so that he knows um I'd like to
 
06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
State one more thing too it go it goes
 
06:03:57.270 --> 06:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
into the decorum during public hearing
 
06:03:58.468 --> 06:03:58.478 align:start position:0%
and and that
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
is and again for the benefit of our new
 
06:04:04.190 --> 06:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
members we sit here and we listen to the
 
06:04:06.390 --> 06:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
testifiers and the testifiers can many
 
06:04:08.990 --> 06:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
times can be very passionate and they
 
06:04:12.070 --> 06:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
may say things that you are really in
 
06:04:14.030 --> 06:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
favor of and it's so much so you might
 
06:04:18.750 --> 06:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
say yeah well uh we should here as a
 
06:04:22.150 --> 06:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee we should remain um
 
06:04:24.510 --> 06:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully silent while they're
 
06:04:26.830 --> 06:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
testifying except when you're asking a
 
06:04:29.350 --> 06:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
question and uh although this has only
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
happened on a couple of occasions um we
 
06:04:36.350 --> 06:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
are not expected nor will we condone any
 
06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
verbal or visual reaction from the
 
06:04:41.628 --> 06:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
committee members after a testimony is
 
06:04:44.230 --> 06:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
complete I know there was one time when
 
06:04:47.350 --> 06:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
it was a very was a very wellone uh
 
06:04:49.190 --> 06:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
testimony although we may not have
 
06:04:50.788 --> 06:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
agreed with some of what this person was
 
06:04:53.350 --> 06:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
saying but some did and they started to
 
06:04:57.548 --> 06:04:57.558 align:start position:0%
clap we we do not Clap the general
 
06:04:59.270 --> 06:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
public may attempt to Clack and
 
06:05:01.750 --> 06:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully the chair will gav them to say
 
06:05:05.150 --> 06:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
order in in the room but we we do not do
 
06:05:07.948 --> 06:05:07.958 align:start position:0%
engage any of that here we just uh
 
06:05:09.468 --> 06:05:09.478 align:start position:0%
whoever is talking might just thank the
 
06:05:12.510 --> 06:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
person and we just kind of move on so
 
06:05:14.110 --> 06:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
just a kind of a reminder because there
 
06:05:15.788 --> 06:05:15.798 align:start position:0%
will be some passionate issues that come
 
06:05:18.868 --> 06:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
here from from uh time to time and um
 
06:05:20.230 --> 06:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
especially when the room is filled with
 
06:05:22.750 --> 06:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
people so just a kind of a point there
 
06:05:24.830 --> 06:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
anything else Mr chairman can you think
 
06:05:27.230 --> 06:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
of so just to reinforce what Vice chair
 
06:05:30.390 --> 06:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
Thomas has been talking about our goal
 
06:05:33.750 --> 06:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
in a public hearing is to get the facts
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
so that we can have the information we
 
06:05:38.830 --> 06:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
we need individually and collectively to
 
06:05:41.030 --> 06:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
make a decision about what to do with
 
06:05:41.040 --> 06:05:42.190 align:start position:0%
make a decision about what to do with
this

06:05:42.190 --> 06:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:05:45.190 --> 06:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
bill our questions should focus on the
 
06:05:47.830 --> 06:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
bill itself as much as
 
06:05:50.948 --> 06:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
possible and not be reflective
 
06:05:53.350 --> 06:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily of our own personal feelings
 
06:05:56.310 --> 06:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
we're here to gather
 
06:05:58.788 --> 06:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
information as representative Bernardi
 
06:06:01.670 --> 06:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
will explain in just a moment we can
 
06:06:04.548 --> 06:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
talk about our opinions and our
 
06:06:06.868 --> 06:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
attitudes toward ail in executive
 
06:06:09.788 --> 06:06:09.798 align:start position:0%
session but during a public hearing all
 
06:06:11.948 --> 06:06:11.958 align:start position:0%
we're here to do is to gather
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
information ask intelligent questions so
 
06:06:18.750 --> 06:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
that we can extract information that we
 
06:06:21.030 --> 06:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
can use to make good
 
06:06:22.990 --> 06:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
decisions and with that I'm going to
 
06:06:24.990 --> 06:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
turn it over to representative Bernardi
 
06:06:27.350 --> 06:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
to talk
 
06:06:31.510 --> 06:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
about representative Corman thank you uh
 
06:06:33.708 --> 06:06:33.718 align:start position:0%
are you planning to schedule hearings in
 
06:06:37.548 --> 06:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
half hour slots like last question
 
06:06:40.990 --> 06:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bernardi will now
 
06:06:45.110 --> 06:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
explain what happens in an executive
 
06:06:48.030 --> 06:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
session thank you Mr chair so starting
 
06:06:50.468 --> 06:06:50.478 align:start position:0%
off preliminary requirements uh
 
06:06:52.788 --> 06:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
executive uh sessions obviously have to
 
06:06:55.750 --> 06:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
be scheduled and this and the chair is
 
06:06:58.150 --> 06:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
looking at uh the total number of bills
 
06:07:01.270 --> 06:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
that we have to uh get through and and
 
06:07:04.110 --> 06:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
the uh calendar deadlines for them uh
 
06:07:07.030 --> 06:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
whether they have Financial notes or not
 
06:07:10.510 --> 06:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh a executive session requires a
 
06:07:12.788 --> 06:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
quorum uh and if you don't have a quorum
 
06:07:15.510 --> 06:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
you can't move forward at all as opposed
 
06:07:17.430 --> 06:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
to a hearing where that is not
 
06:07:20.350 --> 06:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily necessary
 
06:07:24.350 --> 06:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
um hence there is a opportunity for
 
06:07:27.788 --> 06:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
Replacements uh uh that be made by
 
06:07:30.910 --> 06:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
seeking uh uh Replacements from the
 
06:07:33.948 --> 06:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
majority or minority offices that has to
 
06:07:37.708 --> 06:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
be done the close of on the before the
 
06:07:39.948 --> 06:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
close of business on the day before the
 
06:07:39.958 --> 06:07:41.548 align:start position:0%
close of business on the day before the
Committee

06:07:41.548 --> 06:07:41.558 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
06:07:45.150 --> 06:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
hearing so the uh executive session
 
06:07:47.910 --> 06:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
starts with the chairman opening the
 
06:07:50.948 --> 06:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
session that's yes can I interrupt just
 
06:07:53.310 --> 06:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
a second the day before the executive
 
06:07:55.868 --> 06:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
session not before the hearing oh did I
 
06:07:58.030 --> 06:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
say that okay you said he the day before
 
06:08:00.150 --> 06:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
the executive session
 
06:08:03.830 --> 06:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes yes just to clarify so the day
 
06:08:05.910 --> 06:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
before the executive session what has to
 
06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
be done the the scheduling has to be
 
06:08:09.628 --> 06:08:09.638 align:start position:0%
done or or seeking substitutes I wasn't
 
06:08:12.350 --> 06:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
substitute has to be sought from that
 
06:08:14.868 --> 06:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
from the respective
 
06:08:19.190 --> 06:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
office it used to be 3:00 as and and now
 
06:08:21.468 --> 06:08:21.478 align:start position:0%
they this guidance says the day before
 
06:08:23.510 --> 06:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
so I don't know when the cut off is you
 
06:08:27.230 --> 06:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
might check in with your respective
 
06:08:27.240 --> 06:08:30.430 align:start position:0%
might check in with your respective
offices

06:08:30.430 --> 06:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:34.548 --> 06:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
okay uh so the uh the session is opened
 
06:08:38.070 --> 06:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
with uh by the chair no motion required
 
06:08:40.350 --> 06:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
but then then we can move into a
 
06:08:43.030 --> 06:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
discussion or a friendly debate or
 
06:08:48.350 --> 06:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
whatever kind of uh facilitated uh uh
 
06:08:51.350 --> 06:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
discussion that we may want to entertain
 
06:08:55.310 --> 06:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
that is between the committee members in
 
06:08:57.430 --> 06:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
doing that if the chair
 
06:09:00.030 --> 06:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh that we need to ask a
 
06:09:02.750 --> 06:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
question of someone who may be expert
 
06:09:07.230 --> 06:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
and in the uh audience or available that
 
06:09:09.788 --> 06:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
that question can be uh made to the
 
06:09:12.468 --> 06:09:12.478 align:start position:0%
public at the chair's
 
06:09:15.548 --> 06:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
discretion once that discussion is over
 
06:09:17.708 --> 06:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
even and there may not be any we may
 
06:09:22.548 --> 06:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
move right straight to uh um a motion uh
 
06:09:25.390 --> 06:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
if no discussion is is required the
 
06:09:26.868 --> 06:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
motion has to be
 
06:09:30.430 --> 06:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
seconded uh and the motion may be
 
06:09:35.070 --> 06:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
withdrawn as well if if uh if things uh
 
06:09:37.788 --> 06:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
don't move as
 
06:09:40.590 --> 06:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
anticipated replacement members are not
 
06:09:43.830 --> 06:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to make the motion or second the
 
06:09:46.750 --> 06:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
motion the eligible motions are ought to
 
06:09:48.670 --> 06:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
pass or ought to pass with amendment
 
06:09:52.190 --> 06:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate retain if it's
 
06:09:55.270 --> 06:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
in the first year of the bium and refer
 
06:09:59.670 --> 06:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:04.230 --> 06:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
year a subcommittee chair may be uh
 
06:10:06.350 --> 06:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
recognized to make the motion if the
 
06:10:08.788 --> 06:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
bill came from a
 
06:10:11.708 --> 06:10:11.718 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh and that preliminary
 
06:10:15.030 --> 06:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on the bill is appropriate o
 
06:10:17.270 --> 06:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
if only if members are not ready to vote
 
06:10:20.510 --> 06:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
if more information is needed a tabling
 
06:10:23.868 --> 06:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
motion is not
 
06:10:27.390 --> 06:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
allowed and if we come to the point of
 
06:10:27.400 --> 06:10:28.310 align:start position:0%
allowed and if we come to the point of
no

06:10:28.310 --> 06:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:10:30.070 --> 06:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation then without
 
06:10:33.150 --> 06:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation that is the last motion
 
06:10:38.948 --> 06:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:41.390 --> 06:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
exhausted so the chair will ask are you
 
06:10:45.910 --> 06:10:45.920 align:start position:0%

06:10:50.190 --> 06:10:50.200 align:start position:0%

06:11:13.990 --> 06:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:18.270 --> 06:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
called um and here's where again if the
 
06:11:21.948 --> 06:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
now with the new uh policy if there's
 
06:11:25.670 --> 06:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
you need to recuse you should have told

the uh uh chair ahead of time and myself
 
06:11:31.750 --> 06:11:31.760 align:start position:0%

called amendments are voted on
 
06:11:36.390 --> 06:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
individually and if there's multiple
 
06:11:38.468 --> 06:11:38.478 align:start position:0%
amendments and they don't conflict
 
06:11:40.910 --> 06:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
they'll all be combined into one big
 
06:11:42.510 --> 06:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment and reported out of the
 
06:11:45.510 --> 06:11:45.520 align:start position:0%

amendments and and copies thereof ready
 
06:11:54.750 --> 06:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
at the start of an executive
 
06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
session they are identified by their
 
06:12:01.350 --> 06:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
amendment number which is uh uh given by
 
06:12:05.830 --> 06:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
the drafters um and amendments are may
 
06:12:09.030 --> 06:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
be adopted by Voice vote show of hands
 
06:12:11.590 --> 06:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
or roll call so that's new from last
 
06:12:14.670 --> 06:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
year last year we we did everything by
 
06:12:18.468 --> 06:12:18.478 align:start position:0%
roll call but it's uh the new guidance
 
06:12:21.750 --> 06:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
is voice show of hands or roll call on
 
06:12:21.760 --> 06:12:22.750 align:start position:0%
is voice show of hands or roll call on
the

06:12:22.750 --> 06:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:12:25.750 --> 06:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
Amendments the final roll call is a
 
06:12:28.708 --> 06:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
final roll call is required at the end
 
06:12:31.070 --> 06:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh to get the final full committee
 
06:12:33.910 --> 06:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation on on the
 
06:12:38.788 --> 06:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
bill uh one can still change their vote
 
06:12:43.590 --> 06:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
on any Bill if it is done while the the
 
06:12:46.910 --> 06:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh the bill is still in control of the
 
06:12:50.270 --> 06:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
committee once we're done and it's gone
 
06:12:53.390 --> 06:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
you can't change that
 
06:12:53.400 --> 06:12:55.590 align:start position:0%
you can't change that
vote

06:12:55.590 --> 06:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
vote
 
06:12:58.190 --> 06:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh bills can be put on a consent
 
06:13:01.468 --> 06:13:01.478 align:start position:0%
calendar if there's no objection uh and
 
06:13:04.788 --> 06:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
they normally will be if there's uh two
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
or for more nay votes or excuse me more
 
06:13:10.510 --> 06:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
than two nay votes the uh the custom is
 
06:13:12.670 --> 06:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
we don't put it on the consent calendar
 
06:13:14.910 --> 06:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's only on the regular
 
06:13:18.510 --> 06:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
calendar no bills with a fiscal note or
 
06:13:24.468 --> 06:13:24.478 align:start position:0%
or uh um any other appropriation uh can
 
06:13:27.868 --> 06:13:27.878 align:start position:0%
be put on the on the consent calendar uh
 
06:13:30.030 --> 06:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
with an ought to pass or ought to pass
 
06:13:32.430 --> 06:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
with Amendment uh
 
06:13:35.270 --> 06:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
vote reconsideration a motion for
 
06:13:37.708 --> 06:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
reconsideration is appropriate and does
 
06:13:40.030 --> 06:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
not require the member to
 
06:13:43.230 --> 06:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
have uh make making a motion to have
 
06:13:46.310 --> 06:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
voted on the prevailing side so anyone
 
06:13:49.590 --> 06:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
can make a reconsideration motion and
 
06:13:52.590 --> 06:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
it's again it's only possible if the
 
06:13:56.390 --> 06:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill is still in the possession of the
 
06:13:59.230 --> 06:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
committee committee
 
06:14:02.628 --> 06:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
reports these are to be clear concise
 
06:14:05.230 --> 06:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
summaries of the legislation and the
 
06:14:07.948 --> 06:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
committee's reason for making the

clerk puts them on the
 
06:15:35.590 --> 06:15:35.600 align:start position:0%

06:15:39.830 --> 06:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
count appears with the majority
 
06:15:43.750 --> 06:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:46.948 --> 06:15:46.958 align:start position:0%
sessions thank you Mr clerk all right
 
06:15:48.788 --> 06:15:48.798 align:start position:0%
questions let's start with
 
06:15:52.350 --> 06:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
06:15:56.270 --> 06:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
um you you briefly alluded to um when
 
06:15:57.628 --> 06:15:57.638 align:start position:0%
there's no recommendation so when
 
06:15:58.948 --> 06:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
there's a tie vote coming out of
 
06:16:01.868 --> 06:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
committee last year the rule was if you
 
06:16:04.230 --> 06:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
had no recommendation and it went
 
06:16:06.990 --> 06:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
through to to the house it went up as
 
06:16:08.990 --> 06:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
OTP and there was discussion about
 
06:16:10.750 --> 06:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
changing it or giving it to the chair's
 
06:16:12.750 --> 06:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
discretion so what is the rule now if we
 
06:16:15.868 --> 06:16:15.878 align:start position:0%
have a tie going to the house so last
 
06:16:19.110 --> 06:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we changed that rule and now
 
06:16:21.030 --> 06:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the committee can
 
06:16:22.670 --> 06:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
designate when it goes to the house
 
06:16:25.230 --> 06:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
floor without recommendation what the
 
06:16:28.910 --> 06:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
first motion is so it used to be that it
 
06:16:31.750 --> 06:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
was automatically OTP but now the chair
 
06:16:35.390 --> 06:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
can say the first motion is itl
 
06:16:38.150 --> 06:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
four representative Corman did you have
 
06:16:41.628 --> 06:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
a question yeah I had a couple
 
06:16:44.390 --> 06:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
um uh representative bernardy you you
 
06:16:46.310 --> 06:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned that in the case of no
 
06:16:49.030 --> 06:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation the final motion must be
 
06:16:51.150 --> 06:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
no recommendation I don't recall that we
 
06:16:54.030 --> 06:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
voted on a no recommendation motion
 
06:16:55.708 --> 06:16:55.718 align:start position:0%
previously it's just that if neither
 
06:16:59.868 --> 06:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:02.310 --> 06:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation okay and then the second
 
06:17:04.948 --> 06:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
question is I remember we had um some
 
06:17:08.628 --> 06:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
confusion last time about when there's
 
06:17:10.110 --> 06:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
an an
 
06:17:15.270 --> 06:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
otpa motion the exact order of of what
 
06:17:18.390 --> 06:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
we do what motions so can can you please
 
06:17:23.430 --> 06:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:27.030 --> 06:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
time yes we started off if we knew there
 
06:17:31.350 --> 06:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
was an amendment we started off with the
 
06:17:35.628 --> 06:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
amendment first and if that passed
 
06:17:39.350 --> 06:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
then that was incorporated into the next
 
06:17:41.868 --> 06:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
motion which was an ought to pass as
 
06:17:44.350 --> 06:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
amended so the bill with the amendment
 
06:17:46.190 --> 06:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
that we just passed so we take them in
 
06:17:46.200 --> 06:17:48.990 align:start position:0%
that we just passed so we take them in
that

06:17:48.990 --> 06:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:53.830 --> 06:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
order so there won't first be an otpa
 
06:17:57.910 --> 06:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
motion the first motion would be for an
 
06:18:01.190 --> 06:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
amendment before there's even an otpa
 
06:18:03.910 --> 06:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
motion is that right that's my
 
06:18:06.670 --> 06:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
understanding although I I am going to
 
06:18:11.190 --> 06:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh clerk training again on
 
06:18:14.350 --> 06:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
Wednesday uh and there may be a change
 
06:18:17.070 --> 06:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
to how that's done and if there is I
 
06:18:20.788 --> 06:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
will advise everyone before we meet and
 
06:18:22.628 --> 06:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
I'm going to a chairs Vice chairs
 
06:18:25.030 --> 06:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
meeting tomorrow morning I will ask that
 
06:18:26.788 --> 06:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
question too to get clarification on
 
06:18:29.430 --> 06:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
that I believe the process we're going
 
06:18:31.910 --> 06:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
to use is we're going to make a motion
 
06:18:34.788 --> 06:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
on the amendment first vote on that then
 
06:18:37.030 --> 06:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
make a new motion ought to pass as
 
06:18:39.030 --> 06:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
amended and vote on that I think that's
 
06:18:40.350 --> 06:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
the way we're going to do it
 
06:18:42.910 --> 06:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Thomas a two-year
 
06:18:45.390 --> 06:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
question representative Corman uh just
 
06:18:49.070 --> 06:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
as a reminder when the motion comes up
 
06:18:52.670 --> 06:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
for an amendment uh the amendment is
 
06:18:55.868 --> 06:18:55.878 align:start position:0%
either approved or not approved there's
 
06:18:58.390 --> 06:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
no OTP or anything like that so just so
 
06:19:01.310 --> 06:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
amendments are approved or non-approved
 
06:19:03.510 --> 06:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
and then you would go into the OTP or
 
06:19:03.520 --> 06:19:05.190 align:start position:0%
and then you would go into the OTP or
otpa

06:19:05.190 --> 06:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
06:19:07.150 --> 06:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh type of thing just it's a it's a
 
06:19:09.190 --> 06:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
technicality but that's that's how it's
 
06:19:09.200 --> 06:19:11.590 align:start position:0%
technicality but that's that's how it's
normally

06:19:11.590 --> 06:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:13.830 --> 06:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
done and that's and that's why when I
 
06:19:17.510 --> 06:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
was going over the notes uh we we said
 
06:19:20.708 --> 06:19:20.718 align:start position:0%
uh the very first thing you you have to
 
06:19:22.628 --> 06:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
have if you have an amendment it's got
 
06:19:25.830 --> 06:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
to come to the chair so he knows about
 
06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
it ahead of time it's not an amendment
 
06:19:28.558 --> 06:19:29.708 align:start position:0%
it ahead of time it's not an amendment
that

06:19:29.708 --> 06:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:19:33.468 --> 06:19:33.478 align:start position:0%
emerges after we were well into the
 
06:19:36.708 --> 06:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
discussion uh I mean there are times
 
06:19:41.310 --> 06:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
that in the discussion of of a bill we
 
06:19:44.590 --> 06:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
have said oh this really would be good
 
06:19:46.868 --> 06:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
to have an amendment and we stopped the
 
06:19:48.830 --> 06:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
executive session and sent things out
 
06:19:50.788 --> 06:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
but that's that's not the normal way of
 
06:19:53.110 --> 06:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
doing business normal way is your
 
06:19:55.868 --> 06:19:55.878 align:start position:0%
amendments are all crafted numbered
 
06:19:58.070 --> 06:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
ready to go ahead of time you start with
 
06:20:02.150 --> 06:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
that first and then you uh you take
 
06:20:04.708 --> 06:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
action on that either is adopted or not
 
06:20:07.150 --> 06:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
if it's adopted then the next motion is
 
06:20:10.510 --> 06:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment or as
 
06:20:13.430 --> 06:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
amended representative Wendy Thomas
 
06:20:17.910 --> 06:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um there is well it's
 
06:20:19.750 --> 06:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's no confusion on amendments but
 
06:20:21.628 --> 06:20:21.638 align:start position:0%
each committee seems to do amendments
 
06:20:23.670 --> 06:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
differently so for example I have a a
 
06:20:26.230 --> 06:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
bill that's going into another committee
 
06:20:29.150 --> 06:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
um it came out of os flawed so it
 
06:20:31.788 --> 06:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
immediately needs an amendment so I
 
06:20:35.670 --> 06:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
contacted the the the chair
 
06:20:37.390 --> 06:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
and and told her the problem and she
 
06:20:41.110 --> 06:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
said I can present the bill as well as
 
06:20:42.948 --> 06:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
present the amendment but she wanted
 
06:20:45.030 --> 06:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who was on the committee to be
 
06:20:46.948 --> 06:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of the
 
06:20:50.150 --> 06:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
amendment last term I think you would
 
06:20:52.190 --> 06:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
not let
 
06:20:55.310 --> 06:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
any Prime sponsors bring forward an
 
06:20:58.310 --> 06:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is that still standing
 
06:21:00.468 --> 06:21:00.478 align:start position:0%
especially knowing that OSS has made
 
06:21:02.390 --> 06:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
many many many
 
06:21:04.590 --> 06:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
mistakes yeah I've heard a lot about
 
06:21:07.510 --> 06:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
mistakes coming out of os this year
 
06:21:09.868 --> 06:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so the way I have done it
 
06:21:11.350 --> 06:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
in the past and the way I would
 
06:21:13.910 --> 06:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
recommend that people do this is to
 
06:21:15.670 --> 06:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony when you
 
06:21:18.590 --> 06:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
testify on your bill and include the
 
06:21:20.708 --> 06:21:20.718 align:start position:0%
language of your amendment in your
 
06:21:23.868 --> 06:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
written testimony with a
 
06:21:27.708 --> 06:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
heading of the nature of I hope the
 
06:21:30.230 --> 06:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee will consider an
 
06:21:32.590 --> 06:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that reflects the following
 
06:21:35.030 --> 06:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
language and then you create
 
06:21:37.948 --> 06:21:37.958 align:start position:0%
exactly the language that you want
 
06:21:40.830 --> 06:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
to be in the
 
06:21:44.310 --> 06:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
amendment because amendments are really
 
06:21:46.468 --> 06:21:46.478 align:start position:0%
the province of the
 
06:21:50.190 --> 06:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
committee so when a bill goes to a
 
06:21:51.990 --> 06:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee is assigned to a committee
 
06:21:54.750 --> 06:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
that bill becomes the committee's bill
 
06:21:59.628 --> 06:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
it's no longer the sponsor's bill and so
 
06:22:02.230 --> 06:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
amendments according to the rules are
 
06:22:05.310 --> 06:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to come from a Committee Member
 
06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
but if you provide the committee with
 
06:22:09.150 --> 06:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
the language that that you would like to
 
06:22:11.628 --> 06:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
see in your Amendment then one of the
 
06:22:14.390 --> 06:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
members can easily pick that up and see
 
06:22:18.230 --> 06:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
that that gets submitted on your behalf
 
06:22:19.788 --> 06:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
so that's the way I would do it that's
 
06:22:22.430 --> 06:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
the way I encourage us to do it in this
 
06:22:24.670 --> 06:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
06:22:26.628 --> 06:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
parshall thank you chair does it go
 
06:22:28.788 --> 06:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
without saying that the committee can
 
06:22:32.390 --> 06:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
also decide to amend the language as
 
06:22:36.110 --> 06:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
offered yes
 
06:22:38.708 --> 06:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely one other thing I would say
 
06:22:42.350 --> 06:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
about um committee
 
06:22:44.390 --> 06:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
reports and there was a lengthy
 
06:22:46.310 --> 06:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
discussion of this in the chairs and
 
06:22:48.670 --> 06:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
vice chairs training session that we had
 
06:22:52.230 --> 06:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago and Paul Smith the
 
06:22:54.990 --> 06:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
clerk spent a lot of time talking about
 
06:22:57.548 --> 06:22:57.558 align:start position:0%
this he and the speaker review every
 
06:23:00.150 --> 06:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
single committee report majority report
 
06:23:03.430 --> 06:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
and Minority Report and he
 
06:23:06.390 --> 06:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
said that it's incumbent upon committee
 
06:23:09.310 --> 06:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
chairs to make sure that all committee
 
06:23:12.788 --> 06:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
reports are reflective of the facts that
 
06:23:16.510 --> 06:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
emerged during the committee public
 
06:23:19.468 --> 06:23:19.478 align:start position:0%
hearing a committee report whether it's
 
06:23:23.788 --> 06:23:23.798 align:start position:0%
majority or minority is not intended to
 
06:23:27.868 --> 06:23:27.878 align:start position:0%
be a statement of opinion on the behalf
 
06:23:31.510 --> 06:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
of the report writer it needs to be a
 
06:23:34.270 --> 06:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
summary of important facts that emerged
 
06:23:37.430 --> 06:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
from from the public hearing
 
06:23:40.910 --> 06:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
and he urged committee chairs if they
 
06:23:43.350 --> 06:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
don't get that in a Minority Report to
 
06:23:45.990 --> 06:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
return it to the writer to the author
 
06:23:49.628 --> 06:23:49.638 align:start position:0%
with instructions for a rewrite
 
06:23:52.548 --> 06:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
so be careful of that be sensitive to
 
06:23:55.110 --> 06:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
that when you write a Minority Report or
 
06:23:57.628 --> 06:23:57.638 align:start position:0%
a majority report leave your own
 
06:24:00.590 --> 06:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
opinions out just report the facts of
 
06:24:05.070 --> 06:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
what you heard in the public hearing
 
06:24:09.830 --> 06:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what uh side those facts
 
06:24:13.990 --> 06:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
support just report the facts that you
 
06:24:17.270 --> 06:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
heard okay representative Vice chair
 
06:24:19.390 --> 06:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
Thomas yeah just just to add to what
 
06:24:21.830 --> 06:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
chairman V said the clerk also
 
06:24:24.910 --> 06:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
reiterated that there is a timeline to
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
get those reports in and the the chair
 
06:24:29.990 --> 06:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
will put that
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
timeline if someone says there will be a
 
06:24:37.030 --> 06:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
Minority Report and a Minority Report is
 
06:24:37.040 --> 06:24:37.830 align:start position:0%
Minority Report and a Minority Report is
not

06:24:37.830 --> 06:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:24:41.070 --> 06:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
forthcoming and misses the timeline then
 
06:24:44.548 --> 06:24:44.558 align:start position:0%
the calendar will reflect no Minority
 
06:24:47.230 --> 06:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
Report um and that's what the clerk said
 
06:24:49.868 --> 06:24:49.878 align:start position:0%
uh so uh please get your reports in on
 
06:24:52.350 --> 06:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
time uh and work with the chair if you
 
06:24:54.670 --> 06:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
have to do any
 
06:24:58.390 --> 06:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
revision to make it on easy on yourself
 
06:25:00.270 --> 06:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
if you anticipate that you will be
 
06:25:03.510 --> 06:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
writing either a majority or a Minority
 
06:25:06.070 --> 06:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
Report you could always write it the
 
06:25:08.510 --> 06:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
night before the executive session and
 
06:25:11.868 --> 06:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
bring it with you then you could hand it
 
06:25:14.750 --> 06:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
in before you leave executive session
 
06:25:16.830 --> 06:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
that day that would make your life a lot
 
06:25:19.468 --> 06:25:19.478 align:start position:0%
easier rather than going home and trying
 
06:25:21.628 --> 06:25:21.638 align:start position:0%
to remind yourself oh I've got to write
 
06:25:24.468 --> 06:25:24.478 align:start position:0%

Robin is the one who sends out the
 
06:27:14.590 --> 06:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
notices of committee activity in the

06:27:20.910 --> 06:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing or an executive session
 
06:27:24.590 --> 06:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
she sends out the notice to everyone and
 
06:27:26.788 --> 06:27:26.798 align:start position:0%

06:27:28.430 --> 06:27:28.440 align:start position:0%

06:27:31.070 --> 06:27:31.080 align:start position:0%

um I notice there's a time change on
 
06:29:08.788 --> 06:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's meeting it was originally
 
06:29:10.510 --> 06:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 9:00 I believe now it's
 
06:29:14.708 --> 06:29:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:18.150 --> 06:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
9:00 no no no no the the start time 9
 
06:29:20.788 --> 06:29:20.798 align:start position:0%
the the start time has always been 9:00
 
06:29:23.430 --> 06:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
the the notice that went out about a
 
06:29:25.750 --> 06:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
time change was about a time change for
 
06:29:28.948 --> 06:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
the public hearing tomorrow afternoon
 
06:29:31.110 --> 06:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay it was originally scheduled for
 
06:29:34.150 --> 06:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
4:00 but I got a call from the speakers
 
06:29:36.628 --> 06:29:36.638 align:start position:0%
office and he said that's too late
 
06:29:38.788 --> 06:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
because I haven't been able to arrange
 
06:29:41.628 --> 06:29:41.638 align:start position:0%
for overtime for this committee staff so
 
06:29:44.548 --> 06:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
if we'd have gone past five o'l people
 
06:29:48.070 --> 06:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
would have Robin and Davis and other
 
06:29:49.750 --> 06:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
house committee Services people would be
 
06:29:49.760 --> 06:29:50.788 align:start position:0%
house committee Services people would be
working

06:29:50.788 --> 06:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
working
 
06:29:53.270 --> 06:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
overtime and it wouldn't be authorized
 
06:29:56.350 --> 06:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
so he asked me to move the meeting up to
 
06:29:58.670 --> 06:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
3:30 so we're starting that public
 
06:30:01.788 --> 06:30:01.798 align:start position:0%

4:45 Tony I just have a a concern about
 
06:30:21.070 --> 06:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
that because I know there's going to be
 
06:30:23.270 --> 06:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
people showing up to testify so what
 
06:30:25.070 --> 06:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
happens if not everybody gets a chance
 
06:30:27.548 --> 06:30:27.558 align:start position:0%
to speak are you gonna maybe postpone it
 
06:30:30.788 --> 06:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
well if people follow our eate etiquette
 
06:30:32.830 --> 06:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
and submit their pink cards let's say I
 
06:30:36.070 --> 06:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
get 10 of them then I'll just decide um
 
06:30:38.590 --> 06:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
okay nobody can speak longer than 4
 
06:30:42.548 --> 06:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:46.230 --> 06:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
that okay anything else well I think
 
06:30:48.388 --> 06:30:48.398 align:start position:0%

06:30:51.190 --> 06:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
