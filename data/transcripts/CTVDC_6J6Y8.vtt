right okay yeah you the these days you
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
never know but I was hoping it was still
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
a legan now we used to work together
 
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
with the Department years ago um you
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
still in the state stuff you still doing
 
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
the state stuff
 
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay well good
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
luck so again I I'll call the meeting to
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
order uh and basically we we're looking
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
at some having a work session on this
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
bill in relative to the estate of teest
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
Banu hopefully I'm pronouncing that
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
correctly so with that I'll open the
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
floor to our committee comments
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative Weber well I following up
 
00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:48.919 align:start position:0%
on the discussion we had at the original
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
hearing um it became very clear that
 
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 align:start position:0%
setting up a dedicated
 
00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
fund was not going to work the way it
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
was worded because we would be both
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
going around the iny statute and we
 
00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
would be uh trying to vacate an existing
 
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
court order for intestacy so that didn't
 
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
sound like a good idea so uh what I have
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
done is I have drafted um an amendment
 
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%
that says that the monies which is cheet
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
to the state through intestacy will go
 
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
to and the first
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
organization uh when I was doing my
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
original research I said appropriated to
 
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
The International Institute of New
 
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
England because they do a great deal of
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
work with um uh settlement and then I
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
got a communication from representative
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
TZ saying that in her experience of
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
centria and The International Institute
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
were the two so I have two
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
identical um amendments one of which
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
gives it all to The International
 
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.910 align:start position:0%
gives it all to The International
Institute

00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
Institute
 
00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
one of which gives it in equal
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
shares and I know that representative
 
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
Maser has another suggestion for our
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
consideration and I let OSS know that I
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
might be coming down and and asking for
 
00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:16.030 align:start position:0%
might be coming down and and asking for
yet

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
another option if if because I didn't
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
want to be presumptuous I just wanted to
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
have the language in front of us so that
 
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
all they have to do is Strike something
 
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
out and write something else in so with
 
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
that I will actually give you copies of
 
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
this so sounds good so that you have
 
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
them one
 
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:52.310 align:start position:0%
them one
two

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
reallya Appropriations language because
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
presumably this goes on to finance which
 
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
will uh make sure the language is
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
correct although I did run it by Mary
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
Jane wner who said she thought it off to
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
be okay okay but she
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
said she always runs those by the
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
Legislative budget assistant which I
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
have not had time to do they two I got
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
two of the
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
same okay then Mr chairman also has the
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
how about representative Missouri do you
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
have two of the same
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
or okay yeah it should be
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
0450 H and
 
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
0451 H that's
 
00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:46.150 align:start position:0%
0451 H that's
correct

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not Mr Speaker
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
but yes that's that's tomorrow
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative Missour thank you Mr
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
chair um yeah so I brought forth and I
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
did mention it when we did our first
 
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
first committee this is when I we first
 
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
brought up the idea of Switching gears
 
00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
you know away from um the department
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
directly to an organization this was one
 
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
I mentioned right from the room um be
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
because I have done a lot of volunteer
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
work with this group in the past um so I
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
can attest to the work that they do
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
specifically with Refugee children um in
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
the inner city of Manchester
 
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
um they it's incredible
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
they that it's all mapped out here um
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
but they really are they they receive
 
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
many times the only meal a day they
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
receive is from here um they they bring
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
all their friends and family and it's
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
their safe space um because as we know
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's difficult when you move from
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
another country here especially and even
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
on our climate and everything it's a lot
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
of families are struggling with figuring
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
things out so uh this organization does
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
it does it all they help with everything
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
I mentioned on here they even helped um
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
a 17-year-old uh pay for her driver's ed
 
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
so she could drive her sick mom you know
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
to appointments and things like that um
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
I was involved in
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
a a
 
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
donation um event at Christmas time and
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
supplied them with hundreds and hundreds
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
of presents for the kids and warm coats
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
so what I love about a nonprofit is the
 
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
money goes directly to benefiting the
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
kids there's no overhead there's no
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
middlemen of you know so I know you
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
would asked um Christina Dyer to make
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
copies you have it in front of you yeah
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%

yeah I sent this last night and I'm
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought an amendment would come
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
out of this subcommittee so I apologize
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
for not putting it on um an amendment
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
yep they do partner with dcyf they
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
partner with elementary schools so when

schools can't um especially during covid
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
when schools were shut down Roa actually
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
started up a program called Excel where
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
they were pulling kids in and helping
 
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
them with their schooling and everything
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with something that is
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
um a little less overtly
 
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:52.389 align:start position:0%
um a little less overtly
religious

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
religious
 
00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:55.069 align:start position:0%
religious
um

00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:55.079 --> 00:14:56.870 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
um what how how do what do you mean
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
overtly religious what what do you mean
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
by that well there's this giant quote on
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
their web page this rock I'll build my
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
church in the gates of H shall not
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
Prevail against it okay uh
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
so I don't disagree with that y i just
 
00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
they put I mean in what they sent me
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
they said they
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
break they they accept they have kids
 
00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
come from all religions of Muslim all of
 
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959 align:start position:0%
that I mean kids are coming wearing
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
their hijabs and I mean they're they
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
don't dis they don't discriminate
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
against anyone so it's not just a
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
Christian organization and it's
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely not they serve for all
 
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
religions and all all genders all Races
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
all of it so yes but that's
 
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:53.069 align:start position:0%
all of it so yes but that's
that's

00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
how right these two and this one other
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
it splits
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
things in more directions
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
geographically and given that this is a
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
windfall to
 
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
everybody um perh I'm just suggesting
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
that that might be a way to to deal with
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
it I'm fine with
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
that specific about kids and
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
specifically children in
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
100% And they're entirely in mancher yes
 
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
yep yes so if it's acceptable
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
to the members of the
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:53.079 align:start position:0%
0418 which is the one that currently
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
says half
 
00:16:55.079 --> 00:16:57.470 align:start position:0%
says half
to

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
um Cent a half to International
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
Institute and I would amend that to say
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
one3 to a centa one third to
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
International Institute and oneir to uh
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
Roa kids of Manchester New hampsh would
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
that be the way I would identify
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:51.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
any any other comments or any other
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this representative prus do
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
you are you comfortable with that or
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
yeah does the department wish to comment
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
sorry much shorter I'm I'm so sorry I
 
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.590 align:start position:0%
sorry much shorter I'm I'm so sorry I
should

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
have thank you so much let me give you
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
those what it does is it just says that
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
all the m which is sheet to this
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
state from this gentleman's intestate
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
State go shall be appropriated so it's
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
just a plain old appropriation and it
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't mess up anybody's budget because
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
they didn't expect it to come in so it
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
just goes out again and then my thought
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
is it goes to finance and then it mess
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:04.310 align:start position:0%
 
much

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
button there you go once it a sheets to
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
the state abandoned property is okay
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
with giving it up with the legislation I
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to presume to speak for them
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
but um sometimes they get a little funny
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
about things and I'm I'm just not sure
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
what their process is so I just wanted
 
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
to throw that out there for
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
thought they can go to finance and
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
figure that out I figured that all of us
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
were concerned about setting up a whole
 
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
new bureaucracy and a whole new fund
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
that then had to be administered and all
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of it we all knew that there
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
are organizations that do the work that
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
we were hoping would be done so uh and
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
this doesn't require anybody to violate
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
a court order or or have the
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
legislature trying to set aside a court
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
order which I'm pretty sure we can't
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
do and um which I wouldn't vote for in
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
any case but um so I'm hoping this will
 
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.669 align:start position:0%
any case but um so I'm hoping this will
work

00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
and somebody wants to complain about
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
it they can and will I and farbeit for
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
me to to throw that out there I just I'm
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
trying to think of the Global solution
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
here from the Department's perspective
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
this is perfect and we really appreciate
 
00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
what you're doing because I think the
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
money is going to go a lot further to
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
help a lot more people this way so
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
that's really from the Department's
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
perspective it's
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
beautiful okay great thank you does the
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
other member from the Department wish to
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
speak or no
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
okay um any other
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
comments representative Missour I'll
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
just say I mean the I I've traveled all
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
over the world and many times to Africa
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
so to Rwanda specifically and when I
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
heard this bill brought forth um it
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
really did uh touch my heart so I'm
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
privileged to be on the subcommittee
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
because it really is I want to see these
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
children and their families that are
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
coming uh you know from other places
 
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
that are really struggling a lot with
 
00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
cultural and everything so um if we can
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
come alongside all these great
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
organizations that are doing the work um
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
outside of the government um I love that
 
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm honored to be a part of that so
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%

00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
yeah okay any representative frus well
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
also I think it's honoring his intent
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
have okay any other
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
comments okay so ultimately we're going
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
to be adopting one Amendment right is
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
that the plan right and it will it has
 
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
to be a whole new Amendment because they
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
won't let us just put a carrot sign and
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
write the name I guess in the Senate
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
they actually all the other body they
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
actually allow that to happen yeah but
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh so I am sending even as we speak the
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
want yeah we're executing it today yeah
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm just telling them we're executing
 
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.269 align:start position:0%
so I'm just telling them we're executing
at

00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
11: this morning we we hope it's at 11
 
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
you never know with some of our hearings
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
well no but I want to have this done by
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
11 whether whether or not um sure
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely and do we need to act and I
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
all these amendments do we just no we
 
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
don't need I'm not
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
off I'm not going to offer them formally
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
because uh it's very clear that what we
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
need is something slightly different but
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
I think we can certainly vote on the
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
sense of the committee subcommittee and
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
make a
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation so would it be
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate to um under comments and
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations I'll not what basically
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
what we've decided to do the third third
