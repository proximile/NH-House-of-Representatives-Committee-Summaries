00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
all right this
 
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh continues the committee of
 
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
conference on house bill 187
 
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
and uh during the dark hours there
 
00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
appeared two amendments and i'd like to
 
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
call on senator bradley to introduce
 
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um so as we
 
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
discussed um over the last couple of
 
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.670 align:start position:0%
discussed um over the last couple of
days

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
i made the suggestion that we should
 
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
model 187
 
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
or whatever the upshot was a discussion
 
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.350 align:start position:0%
or whatever the upshot was a discussion
on

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 417 417
 
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
got non-occurred on there was no
 
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
agreement however
 
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's basically a 417 i apologize i
 
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
didn't bring it over
 
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sure but um this mirrors
 
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
what is now in hb2
 
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
so there's the first is section 8
 
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh the notification section i believe
 
00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
that's the same
 
00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
language and then
 
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
9 it allows the
 
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
legislature to terminate either a state
 
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
of emergency
 
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
or a particular emergency order
 
00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 align:start position:0%
by a majority vote of both the senate
 
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
and the house
 
00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 align:start position:0%
um president voting although
 
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
constitutionally and i don't recall the
 
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
um specific citation in the constitution
 
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
but there has to be a forum
 
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
and then similar similarly to what was
 
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.390 align:start position:0%
and then similar similarly to what was
in

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
now hb2 for the governor's power to
 
00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
renew the merchant store is the same so
 
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
the language is the same and i think
 
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
it will get through the process
 
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
let's put it this way without a forum
 
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have a meeting therefore
 
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
you couldn't have vote
 
00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
so i think that that's implicit in what
 
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
you said here
 
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
well and it's also the constitution
 
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
requires a
 
00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
because that question came up yesterday
 
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
at hp2
 
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
and we had the governor's attorney in
 
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh our attorney rick layman and they
 
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
just cited the specific reference of the
 
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.589 align:start position:0%
just cited the specific reference of the
constitution

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 align:start position:0%
yes representative weber thank you
 
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm wondering we have
 
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is the section that pertains solely
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner of the
 
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner's orders
 
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
so i am wondering why
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
we have the state of emergency
 
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
language in here as well as the
 
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
emergency order language
 
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
well and i wonder or
 
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
like a governor could have multiple
 
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
borders under a overall state of
 
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.190 align:start position:0%
borders under a overall state of
emergency

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
so that gives the current law right now
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
says the legislature can override
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
an emergency but not individual orders
 
00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.149 align:start position:0%
an emergency but not individual orders
so

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
if the legislature deemed
 
00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
one piece of an emergency right
 
00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.710 align:start position:0%
one piece of an emergency right
inappropriate

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
under this language and i just need one
 
00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 align:start position:0%
further clarification of what came into
 
00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
the budget because i
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
was informed by a wmur last night that
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
no provision about the governor's powers
 
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
of the state of emergency
 
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is this
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
no way that it's never happened before
 
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
we adopt it again
 
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
if if you represent to me senator that
 
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
about the issue
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
of without that language
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
are we giving
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature the power to terminate a
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
state of emergency if they already have
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
that do they not
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
and that's what he said at the beginning
 
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
was that there is a provision that the
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
legislature can override an emergency
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
right but not i mean remember i think
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
there were some 80 waters issues
 
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
right there was not the partial
 
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
part of it yeah the line item
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
my beef with dhhs that got resolved
 
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.310 align:start position:0%
my beef with dhhs that got resolved
personally

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
personally
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
um was with one particular item
 
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
nothing else so i wouldn't want to do an
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
all or nothing i'm sorry senator gray
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
when i read this section you know since
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
the emergency orders can be hung on
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
a proclamation for the state of
 
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.629 align:start position:0%
a proclamation for the state of
emergency

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
if you do take away the state of
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
emergency you've taken away
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
all of the emergency orders under that
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
and that's the way i read this
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
and i had no problem with that but the
 
00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
legislature doing that
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm just i'm just concerned about
 
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
putting the removal of the state of
 
00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.350 align:start position:0%
putting the removal of the state of
emergency

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
in this section which deals solely with
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and whether we are
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
putting confusion in where confusion
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to happen
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if people would consider
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
saying the legislature may terminate any
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
emergency order
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
issued under this rather than the state
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
of emergency
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh oh we just got a text from the clerk
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
of the house
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
what we just
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
you i'm going to call him get him on the
 
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.710 align:start position:0%
you i'm going to call him get him on the
phone

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
i i even find that surprising jeremy who
 
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.710 align:start position:0%
i i even find that surprising jeremy who
are

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
discussing because it was internal
 
00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:55.990 align:start position:0%
discussing because it was internal
version

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
version
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill your clerk is wrong i i mean
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
get the speaker to tell them
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%

okay please see you
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
so maybe you can argue your
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
patience is attempting to stop this
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
proceeding then
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%

yes okay um representative weber
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
the suggestion that we're making that
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
will we hope resolve our clerks issue
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
which was the same thing that i was
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
speaking about earlier about the state
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
of emergency being
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
broader than what the commissioner can
 
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
broader than what the commissioner can
issue

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
is simply removing the words a state of
 
00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:14.150 align:start position:0%
is simply removing the words a state of
emergency

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
or so that it reads the legislature may
 
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.470 align:start position:0%
or so that it reads the legislature may
terminate

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
terminate
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
any emergency order issued under this
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
chapter by a majority vote
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
i can see that it's all issued under
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
this chapter but
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
if if we take those words out it
 
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
if if we take those words out it
eliminates

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
eliminates
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh the concern that we are talking about
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
the governor as well as
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
to make a difference whether it's any
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
more and
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
i put in any because i thought that made
 
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.269 align:start position:0%
i put in any because i thought that made
it

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm i'm not going to fuss about
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
the inclusion or exclusion
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
i like i like the word instead of it
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
because so we just strike out the words
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
or or or is that acceptable
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i believe the senate is encouraged
 
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.470 align:start position:0%
and i believe the senate is encouraged
house

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
so that's under consideration are we
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i do is um
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
somebody move um senate amendment 203.
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
could we just go down through one more
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
time sure that we're all so we're we're
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
replacing 89
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
we are eliminating 10. or i guess
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
maybe we just state that but we're
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
exceeding to the
 
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
receiving from the house position
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
exceeding to the senate position with
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
the following amendment
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
fact 10 is not in but the final version
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
has to not have the language of 10 in it
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
however ols decides to phrase that
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
and then we have already uh agreed to
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
the senate position
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
on page nine on the composition of the
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh health and human services oversight
 
00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:02.949 align:start position:0%
uh health and human services oversight
committee

00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
is that you mean the additional member
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're looking at is to
 
00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:21.350 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're looking at is to
exceed

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
exceed
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
to the senate position on this
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
with the um the amendment two
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
zero three three which is items eight
 
00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:32.949 align:start position:0%
zero three three which is items eight
nine

00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency for
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
from line nine we don't actually need a
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
formal motion
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
or you know as long as there's two
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
committees here
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay our committee is in agreement with
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%

once more for the folks at home
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
we agree to the we exceed to the
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
senate version
 
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
with the with the changes in
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
with the removal online nine of the
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%

that is what we're all agreeing to yes
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
