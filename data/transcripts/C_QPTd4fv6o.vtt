our purposes this morning
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
i'd note that we do have a number of
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
people who wish to testify today
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
and so what we're going to do is we're
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
going to provide each of the sponsors of
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
the bill who wish to testify with five
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
minutes to
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
introduce their bill and to speak to the
 
00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:32.390 align:start position:0%
introduce their bill and to speak to the
bill

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
have other people who wish to speak
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
be restricted to a three-minute period
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
for for their testimony
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
if you have handwritten testimony or
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
type testimony that you want to submit
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
you can certainly submit that
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
what we're really interested in doing is
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
hearing from you and your thoughts with
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
we had hearings yesterday
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
we had some difficulty with regard to
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
the microphones
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
in and understanding what people were
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
saying and that's particularly uh an
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
issue with people wearing masks
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
because uh the the voices tend to be
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
blunted and so if you wish to wear a
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
mask you're certainly entitled to do so
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh you could if you uh if you want to
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
you could take off the mask we have by
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
the speaker over here put
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
wipes sterile wipes in case you want to
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
wipe down the microphone if that be the
 
00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
wipe down the microphone if that be the
case

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
you're not not compelled to take off
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
your mask but if you did it might be
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%

speaking to reproductive medical

decisions it covers everything from
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
abortion to poor sterilizations which
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
have targeted communities of color
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
throughout history
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
we cannot emphasize enough that
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
reproductive justice should include both
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
abortion justice and the right to have

i'm bringing this bill before you today
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
when i was a teenager i needed to access
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
abortion care i had to comply with the
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
parental notification law
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
even though my parents are pro-choice i
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
found it deeply unjust that my parents
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
would not need to be involved in the
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
decision to give birth yet would have to
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
be involved in my decision to terminate
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
a pregnancy
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
i thought long and hard about other
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
people in a similar situation to me who
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
came from different homes
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
where perhaps they would face sheer
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
hostility and would have people trying
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
to dissuade them from doing what was in
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
their best interests
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
my own abortion story was the beginning
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
of my journey of fighting for bodily
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
autonomy when i went to hampshire
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
college i began to get involved with
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights activism including
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
working with the civil liberties and
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
public policy program and organizing its
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
annual conference from abortion rights
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
to reproductive freedom transforming the
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
movement for reproductive justice
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
through this work i learned about more
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
stories that widen my view about what
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
reproductive justice is
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
specifically two that i'll mention today
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
one was the story of rosie jimenez in
 
00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:48.870 align:start position:0%
one was the story of rosie jimenez in
1977

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
1977
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
post roe vs wade
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
jimenez died after she was denied access
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
to an abortion
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
unable to afford the cost out of pocket
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
she was also unable to use medicaid
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
funds for the legal procedure and was
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
forced to resort to a dangerous abortion
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
that took her life
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
rosie's story taught me how
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
intersectional abortion justice is this
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
is a racial class and gender justice
 
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.910 align:start position:0%
is a racial class and gender justice
issue

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
the second was the abortion speak out
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
that is part of this annual conference i
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
heard a black feminist speaker loretta
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
ross share her story ross had an
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
abortion when she was a teenager and at
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
23 she experienced sterilization abuse
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
and she was rendered sterile with the
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
dalkin shield
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
what i learned through hearing these
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
stories was that i as a privileged white
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
woman who had faced some barriers had
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
centered my activism primarily on
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
abortion legality
 
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.069 align:start position:0%
abortion legality
however

00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
my sisters
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
of color
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
and brothers too were not only fighting
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
for abortion justice but also for their
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
right to have children
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
this was a crossroads i realized that my
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
activism could just benefit myself and
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
people like me or i could learn from
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
bypoc feminists to also fight for the
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
right of all people to have children
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
children alongside abortion justice
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is why this bill is specifically
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
written to include all reproductive
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
medical decisions
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
not just abortion
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
the fundamental lesson from rosie's
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
story loretta's story my story and
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
millions of other pregnant people
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
throughout history is state interference
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
with a right to have or not to have
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
children is state sanctioned violence
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is unique in that it is a
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment and
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections for
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights are the gold
 
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.470 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights are the gold
standard

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
in addition to the purposely bold and
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
progressive content of the bill the fact
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
that it is a constitutional amendment
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
means it is not subject to the
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
governor's veto it is a lot harder to
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
undo and would mean that we would not
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
need to fight tooth and nail for
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom each time there is
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
a change in control of the state
 
00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.590 align:start position:0%
a change in control of the state
legislature

00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
town and city councils would not be able
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
to pass local ordinances infringing on
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
the right to make personal reproductive
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
medical decisions vermont a state that
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
has consistently promoted progressive
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
protections for its constituents is
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
moving towards constitutional
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
protections of reproductive rights
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents are
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly pro-reproductive freedom
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
but their political party might not
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
align with them on this issue
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
putting this issue on the ballot as a
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment will allow
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
residents to directly show support for
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights an issue of personal
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
liberty that is very important to
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
granite staters
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
this bill should be seen as
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
complementary legislation to other
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights bills this session
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
myself and my co-sponsors full-heartedly
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
support the other pieces of reproductive
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
rights legislation
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
i am asking the judiciary committee
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
to do justice by granite staters and
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
protect their reproductive liberty by
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
voting on to pass on cacr18
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's reproductive liberty
 
00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.230 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's reproductive liberty
amendment

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections for
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
are the gold standard
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
i also enthusiastically support hb 1674
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
the access to abortion care act and hb
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
1673 to repeal new hampshire's abortion
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
ban and ultrasound requirement which i
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
am a proud co-sponsor
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
in light of there being many voices in
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
the room to speak on these essential
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights measures i will be
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
submitting written testimony in favor of
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
the other bills being introduced today
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for hearing my
 
00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:46.470 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for hearing my
testimony

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative mclean did you have a
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you mr chair and
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.069 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
roe

00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
roe
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
solidifies a woman's right to an
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
abortion but it also enables states to
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
regulate abortion later in a pregnancy
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
so if this bill
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
were to pass
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
would it trump grow
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
and how would that impact new
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
hampshire's right to regulate
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
relative to the current state so for
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
example would new hampshire still have
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
the right for example to restrict
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
abortion in the ninth month of pregnancy
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
or would that be lost if this
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment were to go
 
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:29.910 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment were to go
through

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
we have many other speakers who are
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
going to be speaking today and so
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
they will be addressing some of your
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
questions so i can
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
i can defer
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
to the other speakers and if they're not
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
answered i can get back to you i do want
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
to say this is important for me as a
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
reproductive justice activist
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
roe is meant to be the floor
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
not the ceiling so
 
00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.030 align:start position:0%
not the ceiling so
i

00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
believe in addition to legality
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
abortion access
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
is essential
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
and the right to have children

is
essential

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
essential
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
and my goal
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
as a reproductive justice activist
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
not to stop it bro
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
so this bill affects
 
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.669 align:start position:0%
so this bill affects
personal

00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
a doctor's
 
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.830 align:start position:0%
a doctor's
personal

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
decision if the state
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
prohibits the doctor from
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
i want to be very clear representative
 
00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:58.470 align:start position:0%
i want to be very clear representative
that

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
doctors and patients should be making
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
reproductive medical decisions
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
not the new hampshire state legislature
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's my position
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
yeah you can follow up
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
but this is a
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
personal right
 
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.270 align:start position:0%
personal right
of

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
the person who is
 
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.510 align:start position:0%
the person who is
pregnant

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
and the state has
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
licensing capabilities over doctors
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
does this interfere with the state's
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
administration of doctors
 
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.630 align:start position:0%
administration of doctors
licensing

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
i believe this i just want i believe
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation empowers
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
doctors to do what's best for their
 
00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.710 align:start position:0%
doctors to do what's best for their
patients

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
i believe that the attacks that we've
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
seen in this legislative body
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
have harmed medical professionals to
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
provide the care that is best for their
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
patients and overwhelmingly in this
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
state medical professionals have come
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
out in opposition to all that tax on
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom that this
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
legislature has passed
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
and they are supportive overwhelmingly
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
of the three proactive pieces of
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
legislation being proposed today to
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
protect reproductive rights
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative otter did you have a
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman and thank
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative are you aware that in the
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire abortionists do
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
not have to be licensed
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative notter
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
i think that question
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
does not directly relate
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
to this this is protecting the state
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
from interfering with the right
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
of reproductive rights
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is a bill about liberty
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
and it is going to provide protections
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
for people to make the choice to
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
terminate a pregnancy if that's what
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
they want to do
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
and to have children if they want to do
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
it is a protective piece of legislation
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
for patients and providers
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative nader did you want to
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
follow up yes thank you mr chairman
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned in your comments that
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
the decision is between the doctor and
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
the patient but we don't know that the
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
abortionists in new hampshire are
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
doctors because they don't need to be
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
licensed which is why i asked ultimately
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
the dis
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
medical professionals
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
and their patient and their patients
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire politicians
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
you should not be interfering with this
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
concept what i believe is a basic human
 
00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.590 align:start position:0%
concept what i believe is a basic human
right

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
people cannot control their lives if
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
first of all i
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
i would be extremely surprised if uh
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
just anyone can perform an abortion in
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i'd never heard that claim
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
before and and um
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
would this allow this is the same phrase
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's used in the u.s constitution in
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
the second amendment and certainly there
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
are some regulations on guns in spite of
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
what some people think that doesn't say
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
that anybody can take a gun just
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere so
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
likewise if we pass this wouldn't we
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
still be able to have certain
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
regulations like it probably would be
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable to require abortions to be uh
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
performed by a licensed medical
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
professional which i believe is the law
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
now anyway
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
yep so thank you
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative mclean you have another
 
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.190 align:start position:0%
representative mclean you have another
question

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i'm just
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
wondering are you aware of any other
 
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.350 align:start position:0%
wondering are you aware of any other
states

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
that have incorporated
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing
 
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.549 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing
into

00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
their constitutions vermont is moving
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
towards it and i believe they will be it
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
is very likely they will be the first
 
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.270 align:start position:0%
is very likely they will be the first
state

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
and it is our job
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
as politicians to plant seeds for what
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
is good what is going to give our
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
constituents the most protections the
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
the most
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
freedom to value their civil liberties
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
to value gender justice
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
to value racial justice
 
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.590 align:start position:0%
to value racial justice
and

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
even if something cannot pass right now
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
and i hope it does
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
if we don't plant seeds for it it will
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
never be possible
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
things never seem possible
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
until they are done
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
50 years ago did gay marriage seem
 
00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:37.990 align:start position:0%
50 years ago did gay marriage seem
possible

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely not but myself
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
and my co-sponsors
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
we know that we're going to be on the
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
right side of history
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
and those of you who are trying to
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
the sanctity
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
of the right
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
to have a child
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
something that impacts people's
 
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.190 align:start position:0%
something that impacts people's
physical

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
physical
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
psychological and spiritual well-being
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
you will not be on the right side of
 
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.510 align:start position:0%
you will not be on the right side of

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative wolper
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you for my
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't turn my microphone on or
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
off so
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
just speak up as loud as you can
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
representative wilper if you would we're
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
using the microphone to the extent it
 
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.230 align:start position:0%
using the microphone to the extent it
communicates

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
communicates
 
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.510 align:start position:0%
communicates
so

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
the language here includes the word
 
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.830 align:start position:0%
the language here includes the word
inconvenience

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
inconvenience
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
much stronger than any other language in
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
any constitution i've seen can you
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
explain what
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
what inconvenience means
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
in relation to not regulating
 
00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:00.950 align:start position:0%
in relation to not regulating
inconvenience

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
inconvenience
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
mandatory ultrasound requirements or
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
inconveniences in my opinion parental
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
notification laws or inconveniences
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
mandatory waiting periods or
 
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.470 align:start position:0%
mandatory waiting periods or
inconveniences

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
inconveniences
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
all of these things
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
these reactionary
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
right wing
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
attacks that we've seen throughout the
 
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.390 align:start position:0%
attacks that we've seen throughout the
country

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
to chip away
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
they're impeding access
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
and so i'm not interested in just
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
promoting legality
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
legality is essential row is essential i
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
want to uphold the sanctity of that but
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
i want to build on it
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
because it is not enough
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
rosy story speaks to that it wasn't
 
00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:50.710 align:start position:0%
rosy story speaks to that it wasn't
enough

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
too many people what is a legal right if
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
you can't access that right
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
i believe these access barriers
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
and i just i want to say we have a lot
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
of people speaking so i can continue to
 
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.070 align:start position:0%
of people speaking so i can continue to
take

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
some questions
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
but some of your questions may be
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
answered by our other speakers
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
do we have other questions
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
i i just have one question and that and
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
that is looking at the language that's
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
proposed for the constitution
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
and says the right to make personal
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
reproductive medical decisions is
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
inviolate and fundamental to the human
 
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.149 align:start position:0%
inviolate and fundamental to the human
condition

00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
condition
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
and the question is who will
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
and you explain what you intend that to
 
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.430 align:start position:0%
and you explain what you intend that to
mean

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
but when this goes in the constitution
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's no definition of what that is
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
and so who will ultimately decide
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
so this cl so this is gonna
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
this opens the door this is going to
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
help pave the way
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
for reproductive rights in new hampshire
 
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.870 align:start position:0%
for reproductive rights in new hampshire
then

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
if the state chips away
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
challenged because you're going to have
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to the onus is going to be on
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
to prove
 
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.029 align:start position:0%
to prove
that

00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
they're not unduly inconveniencing
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
and so my hope
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
is that the state really
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
listens because constituents support
 
00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:43.630 align:start position:0%
listens because constituents support
this

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly in polls after polls
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
granite staters say that they support
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
and so if you're gonna get in the way of
 
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.630 align:start position:0%
and so if you're gonna get in the way of
that

00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
which you have
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
okay so if i could just follow up on my
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
question then
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
as i understand
 
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
your responses ultimately the court will
 
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.750 align:start position:0%
your responses ultimately the court will
decide

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
what that means if it's going to be
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
will decide
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately but this opens the door
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire residents
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you those access barriers
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
any other questions from his toll
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%

00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
representative schultzer
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
i have passed my written testimony
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
in november of 2018 81 of new
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire's voters
 
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:48.230 align:start position:0%
hampshire's voters
added

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
approved adding 22 more words
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
to our state's constitution
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
right to privacy
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
an individual's right to live free from
 
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion in private or
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
personal information
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
is natural
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
those 22 words
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
were added as article 2 b
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
that amendment was about control
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
and who has it
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens want control over
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
their private and personal information
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
our proposal of cacr18
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
would be added as article 2 c
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
with 31 words which complement article
 
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.190 align:start position:0%
with 31 words which complement article
2b

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
2b
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
and our language
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
the right to make personal reproductive
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
medical decisions
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
is inviolate and fundamental to the
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
human condition
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
neither the state nor any political
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
subdivision shall infringe
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
upon or unduly inconvenience this right
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment like 2b
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
is also about control and claiming it
 
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.590 align:start position:0%
is also about control and claiming it
unequivocally

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
unequivocally
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment didn't come out of thin
 
00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:06.149 align:start position:0%
this amendment didn't come out of thin
air

00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
air
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
just like 2b didn't come out of thin air
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
it has inspiration from current statues
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
statutes and legislative intent let me
 
00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
statutes and legislative intent let me
elaborate

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
elaborate
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
in doing my research there is another
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
place in new hampshire law
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
where control over medical decisions are
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to share with you the first
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
part of chapter 137
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
j titled written directives for adults
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
without capacity to make
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
medical decisions in 137j
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
the purpose and policy statement
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire recognizes
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
that individual persons have the right
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
founded in the autonomy and sanctity of
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
a person to control the decisions
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
relating to the rendering of their own
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
health care
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire legislature amended
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
this chapter three times and
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
consistently reiterated
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
the purpose and policy statement
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire recognizes
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
that its citizens have the right
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
founded in the autonomy and sanctity of
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
a person to control the decisions
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
relating to the rendering of their own
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
medical care
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
when that new hampshire citizen
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
is pregnant
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
their rights to control decisions
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
related to their medical care and the
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
privacy of that personal information
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
is thrown away
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
pregnancy seems to be the line where
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights are stripped away
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
article one of the new hampshire
 
00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:49.430 align:start position:0%
article one of the new hampshire
constitution

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.549 align:start position:0%
constitution
reads

00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
reads
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
all men are born equally free
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
and independent
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
therefore all government of right
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
originates from the people is founded in
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%

good
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
there is no caveat in article 1 that
 
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.070 align:start position:0%
there is no caveat in article 1 that
says

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
all men are born equally free and
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
independent except when pregnant
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
the loss of freedom and independence
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
is exactly what happens
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
in article 2
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
all men have certain natural
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent rights among
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%

life and liberty acquiring possessing
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
and protecting property
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
and in a word of seeking and obtaining
 
00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.389 align:start position:0%
and in a word of seeking and obtaining
happiness

00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
happiness
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
equality of rights under the law shall
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
not be denied
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
or abridged by this state on account of

race creed color sex or national origin
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
except when pregnant
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire citizen who is pregnant
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
loses the benefit
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
of their life
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
and liberty
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
to the mercy of the state
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
particularly if their pregnancy
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
is life-threatening or if their
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
pregnancy loses viability
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
their rights to seek happiness by making
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
reproductive medical decisions
 
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.310 align:start position:0%
reproductive medical decisions
independently

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
independently
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
as is their natural right
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
are stripped away
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
they no longer have control over their
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
own body
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
they are enslaved to a law
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
marginalizing pregnant people by
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
stripping them of their natural
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent rights of control
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
over their reproductive medical
 
00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:47.590 align:start position:0%
over their reproductive medical
decisions

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
is not the new hampshire way
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
when a person does not have freedom over
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
their med reproductive decisions because
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
of state interference they are chattel
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
this is not the new hampshire way
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens value our natural
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
rights and it is unjust and undue and
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
undue burden to restrict the
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
reproductive medical decisions made by
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens it is time
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
it is time
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
to enshrine our values of freedom
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
of reproductive decisions into our state
 
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.950 align:start position:0%
of reproductive decisions into our state
constitution

00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
because the constitutional protections
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
for reproductive rights
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
are the gold standard
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
i respectfully ask you to vote ought to
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
pass on cacr18
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative aldschiller
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm just i'm just
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
sorry my microphone i'm just trying to
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit the the scope of
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
the phrase
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
unduly inconvenience are you aware of
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere in any other states where that
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
phraseology is used in relation to you
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
know reproductive law i'm just trying to
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
see if there has been a precedent or
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
anything established around that
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
phraseology anywhere
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh that phraseology
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
is a new hampshire original
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
because that's the new hampshire way and
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
we would like to
 
00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.829 align:start position:0%
we would like to
put

00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
the questions because there seem to be
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
enormous questions um
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
within our state legislature
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
while the state electorate does not have
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
the same reservations and questions that
 
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.910 align:start position:0%
the same reservations and questions that
indeed

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
indeed
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
reproductive medical freedom
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
is a natural right
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
and it is not the state's
 
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.829 align:start position:0%
and it is not the state's
business

00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
to make decisions about
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
whether someone should or shouldn't have
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
a child
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
whether they can or cannot access birth
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
control whether they should or shouldn't
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
or at what age
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
they might access a vasectomy whether
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
they should or shouldn't carry a
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
pregnancy to term regardless of whether
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's life-threatening whether
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
a pregnancy is
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
something that has to be carried in the
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
event of an incestual rape
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
all of that is a decision to be made
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
by the person for whom it affects
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
so i have no business making
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
reproductive decisions about your health
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
any more than you have business making
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
reproductive decisions about mine
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think uh if i could ask a question
 
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.990 align:start position:0%
i think uh if i could ask a question
certainly

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
and it gets to the beginning of your
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
statement and talking about the
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment with regard to
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
privacy which
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
was already voted on by the people and
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
one of the issues with that
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
particularly with regard to the
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee and our experience
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
on the judiciary committee is nobody
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
knows what it means
 
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.030 align:start position:0%
knows what it means
so

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
i think there's a general sentiment that
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
people want to have privacy
 
00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.430 align:start position:0%
people want to have privacy
but

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
nobody knows how that applies to their
 
00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:24.710 align:start position:0%
nobody knows how that applies to their
lives

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
the question is was that constitutional
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
amendment actually meaningful
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
and i guess that's the question that i
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
would have with regard to this and that
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
it is so general
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
what does it mean and it gets to the
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
question i think i asked before is
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
are we just going to allow the court to
 
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.470 align:start position:0%
are we just going to allow the court to
decide

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
what this means by virtue of cases is
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
so the intent of
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
any constitutional amendment and i would
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
i would hazard to say the intent
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
when writing the new hampshire new
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
was to set in place a series of values
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
that with which we value so for instance
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
you re you referenced
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
my beginning statement and
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
i did talk about article 2b
 
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.910 align:start position:0%
i did talk about article 2b
and

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
article 2
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
that says all men have certain natural
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent rights among
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
which are the enjoying and defending
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
life and liberty acquiring and
 
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.430 align:start position:0%
life and liberty acquiring and
possessing

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
possessing
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
protecting property and in a word of
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
seeking and obtaining happiness
 
00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:44.310 align:start position:0%
seeking and obtaining happiness
so

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
that is not a prescriptive statement of
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
exactly how to enact that and it is then
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
as we know the responsibility of the
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
citizenry as outlined in part one that
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
we are to govern ourselves and that we
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
govern in
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
with consent um
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
and with a
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
with the government originating from us
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
founded in consent and instituted for
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
the general good so
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
the constitution is a value statement
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the legislature and the courts have
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
dig through the weeds
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
and figure out how that applies i would
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
hazard to say that also in the
 
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.470 align:start position:0%
hazard to say that also in the
constitution

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.430 align:start position:0%
constitution
women

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
women
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
are not mentioned
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
and yet we are subject to all of the
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
laws of this state
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
and so there is an interpretation that
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
we should be included so the
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation part is our job
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions

and we feel empowered and free and it is
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
the first time that i'm pleased to offer
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
this constitutional amendment for the
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
women of concord and new hampshire
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
i just want to tell you a personal story
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit about me and reproductive
 
00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:37.270 align:start position:0%
a little bit about me and reproductive
health

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
i'm a mom of three
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
and it has taken great effort to become
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
a mom of three
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
i worked really hard and spent a lot of
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
money to have twins four years ago
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
and was successful
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
and immediately after i had those twins
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
i found myself pregnant again
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
i wasn't ready to have another child i
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know what to do
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
i prayed about it my husband and i
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
talked about it long into the night
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
and it turned out that that pregnancy
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
was not viable
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
i ended up having an ectopic pregnancy
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
that could have killed me
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
and my ability to make the decision to
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
have surgery and end that
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
saved my life
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
taking away a woman's decision
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
about what she does when she's pregnant
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
can indeed risk the life of the mother
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
and in my case it would have killed me
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
if i could not have had that removed
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm down one ovary
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
but i was fortunate enough with a little
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
bit help of science to get pregnant
 
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.870 align:start position:0%
bit help of science to get pregnant
again

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
and have a little girl who's now one
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
year old
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm very lucky
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
but that could have gone really badly
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
and a lot of horrible things could have
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
happened during that high risk pregnancy
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
because i have high blood pressure
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
and once again
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
between myself and my doctor we had to
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
look into what were the right decisions
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
every month every time i had a scan we
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
had to look into that and it was between
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
me and my doctor
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
and so i'm here representing the women
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
of concord and the women of new
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire to let you know that we will
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
make the decisions that we need to make
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
that are right for us and right for our
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
families and there is no reason for the
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
state to get involved
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
and so i thank you for your time and i
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
wish for you to consider that it is 2022
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
and that women know what we're doing
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
and that we will take care and do the
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
right things thank you i'm happy to take
 
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.270 align:start position:0%
right things thank you i'm happy to take
questions

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative mick
 
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.550 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative mick
williams

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
williams
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that this is a decision
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
between you and your doctor
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
and the amendment is a personal decision
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
is protecting the personal decision
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
the doctor is licensed by the state do
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
you propose that we should have doctors
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
that are not licensed
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
the reason i mentioned myself and my
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
doctor is because i was referring i was
 
00:42:57.839 --> 00:42:58.950 align:start position:0%
doctor is because i was referring i was
relying

00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
relying
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
on a medical professional
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
who's been through this thousands of
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
times with other people
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
and who understands where we were in the
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
process and what things looked like i do
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
not pretend to be a doctor nor do i play
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
one on television and so i believe that
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do is refer
 
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
with de confer with a medical
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
professional to make these decisions but
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
make no mistake it was not my doctor's
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
decision it was my decision and it was
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
informed by what my doctor was telling
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%

00:43:33.359 --> 00:43:35.030 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%

so at this point in time we'll be
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
looking at testimony for three minutes
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
we do have another representative who
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak and that's
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you um chairman

00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%

and i represent grafton county district
 
00:44:16.319 --> 00:44:18.230 align:start position:0%
and i represent grafton county district
11.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
11.
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
i'm coming before you today not to
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
discuss the morality of the law
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a lot of people on
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
either side of the issue that will
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
discuss that
 
00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:29.030 align:start position:0%
discuss that
and

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to leave it to them
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
what i'm coming before you today to do
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
is to talk about the language that's
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
involved in this law
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
it is incredibly broad
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
and it will lead to a
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
large number of unintended consequences
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
while working in the colorado state
 
00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:49.589 align:start position:0%
while working in the colorado state
legislature

00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
this same exact not exact wording but
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
really close came before the legislature
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
we discussed this of course
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
all throughout the capital you can
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
imagine all the little conversations
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
that pop up
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
and we came up with so many unintended
 
00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:09.990 align:start position:0%
and we came up with so many unintended
consequences

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor chose to pull the bill
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
before it went to the floor for debate
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
and no vote
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
that if this were to pass
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up with those
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences here
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
some of the issues in the language that
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
are concerning
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
is age
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk anything about an age is
 
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.150 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk anything about an age is
this

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
just someone who is of the age of
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
majority or is this someone who happens
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
to be 12 years old
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
we there has to be some
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
one involved in that child's life
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's a parent who
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
loves them and cares for them who is
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
helping take them to the doctor
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
that will be involved in this
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
a 12 year old unless
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
they're incredible and i know when mine
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
were 12 they would not have made a good
 
00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.270 align:start position:0%
were 12 they would not have made a good
decision

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
that is important to have that parental
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
notification and advice
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
the second is gender
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
this doesn't talk anything about gender
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
and yesterday in this committee you
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
heard a bill
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
about the father's reproductive rights
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think from the
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
from how i read the room i'm not quite
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
sure that that's going to go very far
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
um and so but
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you're leaving room in
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
here for fathers
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
to now sue
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
a woman who has had an abortion
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
because his rights were violated
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
so that's nothing that needs to be
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
cleaned up
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
and then also it doesn't really clarify
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
of is this just
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
for ending an abort a life or pregnancy
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
or is this also
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
for being able to get pregnant 15
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
seconds okay i'll just finish this one
 
00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:13.829 align:start position:0%
seconds okay i'll just finish this one
up

00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
i have more but um
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
so then we run into other problems with
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
that as well that the state has to get
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay and so i
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
do not support this bill and i would ask
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
you to vote itl
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative folsom
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
here representative oregon
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
um yes and i
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
guess i asked this question of a
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
supporter of this bill some might be
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
fair to ask this question but opponent
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
of the bill the
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
the key the phrase shall not uh be
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
infringed echoes the second amendment
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
and i suppose there's a lot of
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
disagreement about how much regulation
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
the second amendment u.s constitution
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
applies but historically haven't
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
hasn't that always been interpreted to
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
mean that the government has at least
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
some leeway to regulate
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
firearms so wouldn't there be at least
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
leeway here to uh regulate abortions but
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
it just wouldn't
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
but it would prevent the state of new
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire from
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
this were to um
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
and with that word
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
um inconvenience and infringe and those
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of words
 
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.549 align:start position:0%
kinds of words
basically

00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh the fetal protection act like
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
protection act could stand in place
 
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.710 align:start position:0%
protection act could stand in place
because

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's a reasonable infringement
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
it's a reasonable alternative
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
so if they really want to make sure
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
the the right to make that decision up
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
to birth then that's what they should
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
work on
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
not creating an overall
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh broad category that
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden we're back in here
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
making the same decision as to how we
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
are going to inter interpret that that
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm curious what your
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts are on
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
speaker's testimony where she talked
 
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.790 align:start position:0%
speaker's testimony where she talked
about

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
equality except for when you're pregnant
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens who are pregnant
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
lose their benefits of liberty and
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
life and liberty particularly if their
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is a life-threatening or
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
pregnancy loses visibility how do you
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
feel about that do you feel that
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
the law the way it is now the
 
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.750 align:start position:0%
the law the way it is now the
constitution

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and i'm
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
going to try and there's a few parts to
 
00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:54.390 align:start position:0%

that
 
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.830 align:start position:0%
that
so

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:55.840 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
the first part oh gosh i'm trying to go
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
back to the first part of your question
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to start with the etopic
 
00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.069 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to start with the etopic
pregnancy

00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is a risk to the health of the
 
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.109 align:start position:0%
that is a risk to the health of the
mother

00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
mother
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
vans in this state even within the fetal
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
protection fetal life protection act
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
she is allowed to get an abortion if it
 
00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.390 align:start position:0%
she is allowed to get an abortion if it
is

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
as she was afraid would kill her etopic
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancies are very very dangerous
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
so that would not be stopped by the laws
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.559 --> 00:50:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
again

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:36.710 align:start position:0%
again
i

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
the women in the state do have a right
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
to have an abortion up to the week 24
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
for any reason whatsoever
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
and any time
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
we basically just followed what the
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
supreme court said of at 24 weeks
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
where you're looking at there's another
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
life involved so we wanted to protect
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
the second life as well as the life of
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
the mother
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%

00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
i want to focus on the
 
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.829 align:start position:0%
i want to focus on the
unduly

00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
unduly
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
inconvenience at this point
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
considered unduly
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
inconvenient to require a
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
medical professional to be the person
 
00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.829 align:start position:0%
medical professional to be the person
performing

00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
performing
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
the procedure that's desired here
 
00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.589 align:start position:0%
the procedure that's desired here
um

00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
in my own personal opinion i'm going to
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
give this and i think
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
being on the health human services
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee we deal with a lot of these
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
and plus the licensure board and all of
 
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.190 align:start position:0%
and plus the licensure board and all of
that

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
if you think about the people who
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
perform other
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
types of invasive uh procedures on a
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
woman's body or on a man's body
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
most of them
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
have to be licensed
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
and um so that i would definitely want
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
it to be a person for the safety of the
 
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.069 align:start position:0%
it to be a person for the safety of the
mother

00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
mother
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
um to you and the woman i would want
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
that person to be licensed and very
 
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.670 align:start position:0%
that person to be licensed and very
carefully

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
um i was looking at the
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
bill after you mentioned age and you're
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
right i don't see age listed anywhere
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
there but i'm wondering if you can tell
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
me if it's if the
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
if anyone's age is talked about in other
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
places in the constitution in other
 
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:52.309 align:start position:0%
places in the constitution in other
articles

00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
i i'd have to
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
check with the constitution specialist
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
there is a law regarding age i'm maybe
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
someone on here could answer that better
 
00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:10.710 align:start position:0%
someone on here could answer that better
but

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.750 align:start position:0%
but
maybe

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be the first ones to
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
change that i mean
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
by keeping with the language
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
of the constitution
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
by not mentioning age
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
situation if this went through
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
then it would open the door
 
00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.390 align:start position:0%
then it would open the door
for

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
anyone of any age
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
could could receive any

it so that most granite
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
that the idea that most great states
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
agree on uh that it is a fundamental
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
human right and that it should be
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%

00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
to a
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
document that has been changed beyond
 
00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.990 align:start position:0%
document that has been changed beyond

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
up till now
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
an amendment cannot be made to the
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
constitution that
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
opposes that constitution and this one
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
does it flies in the face of right to
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
life liberty and the pursuit of
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
happiness we're talking about the
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
mothers who are pregnant
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
but we don't talk about
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
we talk about having or not having
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
children as if their property
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
what about the child who doesn't have
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
a definition of life is growth and
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
development and if i can bring science
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
into it when a sperm from
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me when a sperm fertilizes an egg
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
that egg
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
starts to develop and grow
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
it starts to become a human
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
child not an elephant
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
our writers of the constitution relied
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
i know i shouldn't mention him but
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
he doesn't depend upon your belief or
 
00:57:48.559 --> 00:57:50.230 align:start position:0%
he doesn't depend upon your belief or
unbelief

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
unbelief
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
he is
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the truth doesn't depend upon
 
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.030 align:start position:0%
and the truth doesn't depend upon
opinions

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
or perceptions
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
when you get rid of
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
the life that is in the womb it is
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
murder unless and we do again have laws
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
that stipulate if the life of the mother
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of rape and all that that's why
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
we have parents
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
so that they can guide their children
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
to snuff out that life that had no say
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
in how it got there
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
is murder
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
my last point is
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
you all make an oath
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
to protect the rights of the
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%

00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
to pursue life
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
to continue in their development and
 
00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.549 align:start position:0%
to continue in their development and
growth

00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%

cacr18
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
on december 1st the u.s supreme court

heard oral arguments in a case from
 
01:00:03.119 --> 01:00:04.390 align:start position:0%
heard oral arguments in a case from

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
mississippi
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
in which the state overtly asked the
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
court to overturn the roe v wade
 
01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.470 align:start position:0%
court to overturn the roe v wade
decision

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
now on its heels
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
is the six-week abortion ban in texas
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
which has been in effect since september
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
1st 2021
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
and that ban is forcing those in texas
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
who are seeking abortion to take time
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
off work
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
find child care
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps travel thousands of miles
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
including here to new hampshire
 
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.630 align:start position:0%
including here to new hampshire
or

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
instead to remain pregnant against their
 
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.670 align:start position:0%
instead to remain pregnant against their
will

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
we expect the supreme court to take up
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality of that case from
 
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:41.750 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality of that case from
texas

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
texas
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
though to be clear
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
they have not intervened and that near
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
total six-week ban remains in effect
 
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.829 align:start position:0%
total six-week ban remains in effect
today

01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
as the u.s supreme court considers these
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
two cases that could overturn roe v wade
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
and allow states to ban abortion
 
01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.390 align:start position:0%
and allow states to ban abortion
altogether

01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
this constitutional amendment would
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
enshrine the right to reproductive
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
medical decisions
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
every state legislature in our country
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
will need to make a decision if and when
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
the roe v wade decision is overturned
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
whether to further restrict access to
 
01:01:13.359 --> 01:01:14.470 align:start position:0%
whether to further restrict access to
abortion

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
or instead to protect it and ensure that
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
abortion is safe legal and accessible
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
if this amendment is adopted the right
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
to make personal reproductive medical
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
decisions will be guaranteed by the new
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%

01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
are women that are
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
not only in financial distress some of
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
them on the verge of homelessness some
 
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.990 align:start position:0%
them on the verge of homelessness some
escaping

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
escaping
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
domestic violence stories that you can't
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
even imagine women sitting next to me
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
with bruises on their neck from being
 
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
choked by their partners some of them
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
have had to stay in safe houses to try
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
to escape these situations
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
and these are the women that i'm
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
speaking for today because any bands
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
that we place in front of them any
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
obstacles we place in front of them
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
causes harm to them the children that
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
they already have
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
these are the stories that don't get
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
told often because nobody wants to
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
retell these stories no one wants to
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
relive this
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
these women have post-traumatic stress
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
and i support these women pro bono
 
01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:24.630 align:start position:0%
and i support these women pro bono
because

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
i believe in this work that i do someone
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
asked me
 
01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
how can you do this this is so
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
depressing because i don't believe in
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
just doing good i believe in doing
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
what's right
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
and that is incredibly important the
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
more barriers that these women have
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
the more violence is enacted upon them
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
violence enacted upon the children that
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
these women have and they're trying to
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
make a better life for themselves and
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
i do this as my work
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
i see this on a regular basis
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm here for them and i'm here to
 
01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.510 align:start position:0%
and i'm here for them and i'm here to
support

01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
the bill that amanda tol has
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
proposed because this will
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that these families and these
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
women will not have any more barriers to
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
having a decent life thank you thank you
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:37.029 align:start position:0%
 
hello

01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
hello
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak i'll
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
be short and sweet
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
my name is jody newell and i live in
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
keene i'm a proud mother of two and i'm
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
here today to speak in favor of cacr18
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
while my children's father passed away
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
shortly after they were born my boys
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
know that they were created in love and
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
that they are my top priority
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
since their father's passing however i
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
have had to make some tough decisions
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
one of which was to end pregnancy you
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
see i know very well
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh how hard it can be to lead a family
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
through grief loss and struggle
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that if i had had if i
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
had not had that choice i would not be
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
here today
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes i'm not sure how we got
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
through with just the three of us let
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
alone another
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
if there's one thing life has taught me
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's humility it's that i can't judge
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
another based on my own experience and
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
that even if i think i know what someone
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
is going through i can't possibly have
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
all the context so while i want to
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
impress upon you the weight of my
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
decision the circumstances surrounding
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
it etc at the end of the day the
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
decision was mine to make
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
i am the person most qualified to make
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
it and that is exactly why i stand here
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
today to support this resolution
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
because reproductive health decisions
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
are each individuals to make not the
 
01:05:53.039 --> 01:05:53.990 align:start position:0%
are each individuals to make not the
states

01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
this is a fundamental human right
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
and as such it should be codified in our
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
constitution thank you
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.230 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you thank you for coming
today

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
good morning committee my name is josie
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
pinto executive director of the
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom fund of new
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%

01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
before you to express my support for crc
 
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
before you to express my support for crc
cacr18

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
cacr18
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
the time is now to protect the essential
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
right to abortion that has been provided
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
by roe v wade for the last 49 years
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
to be honest it's the bare minimum as
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
amanda said roll row is the floor not
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
the ceiling
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
all the time i hear granite staters
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
claim to have the values of bodily
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
autonomy medical privacy and lack of
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
government infringement on health care
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
except when it comes to abortion
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
i am begging you all to extend those
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
values to abortion as well recognizing
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
what a deeply personal decision it is
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
for each individual that makes that
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
decision for themselves for their
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
families for their health and for their
 
01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.870 align:start position:0%
families for their health and for their
well-being

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
on december 1st i was in dc for the
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
dobbs vs jackson hearing standing in
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
solidarity with my fellow abortion fund
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
leaders in the south who will be the
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
most impacted by the increased abortion
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
restrictions sweeping the country
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
the fact is many states in the south
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
have already are living in a post road
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
reality that's only going to get worse
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
i won't stand by and watch new hampshire
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
go down that same path
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
i won't stand by and watch a 24-week ban
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
turn into a 15-week ban as our rights
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
get chipped away over time
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
this needs to end here and now and this
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
bill is the strongest way we can
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
solidify that right
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
since this issue is so deeply personal
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
we should let voters show us where they
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
stand i'm asking you all to give them
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do that
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
as we prepare for the reality of a
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
post-row america the reproductive
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
freedom fund of new hampshire is
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
preparing for increased barriers that
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
will likely cause many people to have to
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
seek care out of state and will likely
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of people traveling
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire for abortion care
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
our surrounding states vermont and
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
massachusetts are working hard to
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
enshrine those rights into law and scale
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
up their services in ways that can
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
accommodate this expected new influx i'm
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
heartbroken watching new hampshire do
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
the opposite strip funding from our
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
health centers pass increased
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
restrictions and eliminate entire
 
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
methods of abortion access through
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
enacting an ultrasound mandate
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
this is simply not in line with our
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
state values
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
for this and so many other reasons i
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote ought to pass on cacr18
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for ms
 
01:08:48.239 --> 01:08:51.269 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for ms

for 49 years abortion care has been safe

and legal in this country
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
and although it has never been easily
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
accessible to all women regardless of
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
race geographical location or income
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
over the past decade
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
it has become even harder to access as
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
many states across the country have been
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
intentionally restricting access
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
it is quite likely that in june the
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
supreme court will overroll roe v versus
 
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.510 align:start position:0%
supreme court will overroll roe v versus

wade
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
the expected overturning of roe poses a
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
threat to the constitutional right to an
 
01:10:48.239 --> 01:10:49.830 align:start position:0%
threat to the constitutional right to an
abortion

01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
the majority of my constituents and the
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
majority of granite staters expect that
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
women will still have the right to
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
access safe legal abortion when roe
 
01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.870 align:start position:0%
access safe legal abortion when roe
falls

01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
falls
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm introducing this bill
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
the access to abortion care act because
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
i feel we have a responsibility as
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
legislators to ensure that women have
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
access to safe legal abortion
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear that this bill does
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
not change any current new hampshire
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
abortion laws
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
it does however provide critical
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
protections to ensure that granite state
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
women and girls and their families can
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
work with their doctors to get the
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
health care they need in the majority of
 
01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
health care they need in the majority of
situations

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
last year nearly 600 abortion
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions were introduced nationwide
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
90 of these restrictions have been
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
enacted into law including new
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire's first abortion ban in modern
 
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire's first abortion ban in modern
history

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
this is more than any year since roe v
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
wade was decided in 1973.
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
for generations rowe has had bipartisan
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
support especially in new hampshire poll
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
after poll has shown that access to safe
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
legal abortion is popular and support is
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
at the highest it's been in two decades
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
with seven in ten americans opposed to
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
overturning roe v wade
 
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the current makeup of the
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
supreme court does not represent the
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
majority of people in new hampshire
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
this is why we need to be proactive
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
about putting women's rights into the
 
01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.910 align:start position:0%
about putting women's rights into the
statute

01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
according to the world health
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
organization restrictive abortion
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
regulation can cause distress and stigma
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
and risk constituting a violation of
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
human rights of women and girls
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
including the right to privacy and the
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
right to non-discrimination and equality
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
while also imposing financial burdens on
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
women and girls
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
this bill provides the opportunity to
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
protect the rights of women and girls to
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
privacy to non-discrimination and to
 
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.350 align:start position:0%
privacy to non-discrimination and to
equality

01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
equality
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
the who also tells us that evidence
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
shows that restricting access to
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
abortions does not reduce the number of
 
01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
abortions however it does affect whether
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
the abortions that women and girls
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
attain are safe and dignified
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the university of california san
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
francisco shared research from a
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
longitudinal study of women who have
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
been turned away from having an abortion
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
this study has taught us that denying a
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
woman an abortion creates economic
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
hardship and insecurity that lasts for
 
01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.510 align:start position:0%
hardship and insecurity that lasts for
years

01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
women who were turned away and went on
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
to give birth experienced an increase in
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
household poverty lasting at least four
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
years relative to those who received an
 
01:13:24.159 --> 01:13:25.430 align:start position:0%
years relative to those who received an
abortion

01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
years after an abortion denial women
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
were more likely to not have enough
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
money to cover basic living expenses
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
like food housing and transportation
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
being denied an abortion lowered a
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
woman's credit score increased a woman's
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
amount of debt and increased the number
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
of their negative public financial
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
records such as bankruptcies and
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
evictions this brings me to my concern
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
for the medical system that supports
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
women and girls in new hampshire
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses access for all women
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
to equal to quality reproductive health
 
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.030 align:start position:0%
to equal to quality reproductive health
care

01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
right now ob gyns who've been trained to
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
treat each individual patient as they
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
present to them
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
have to weigh whether they will come to
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
practice in a state that does not trust
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
doctors to provide appropriate care to
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
their patients
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
ob gyns need to be able to respond to
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
the needs of each patient they see
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
and not to feel as if they are under
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
constant threat
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
putting women's right to an abortion
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
into statute ensures that health care
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
providers for women will want to come
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
here to practice
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
women here need and expect quality
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
health care
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
it's a disservice to all women and
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
families if we're not able to continue
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
to attract the most professional and
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated doctors
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
as we anticipate the overturning of roe
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
v wade each state has the option to
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
choose to restrict or to continue to
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
ensure access to safe legal abortion
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
this is our opportunity in new hampshire
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
to build on our long-standing bipartisan
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
support for reproductive rights and put
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
this right into law
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
again this bill does not change the
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
current law including the 24-week
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
abortion ban what it does is ensure that
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
our constituents have access to abortion
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
care within the laws that currently
 
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.229 align:start position:0%
care within the laws that currently
exist

01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
finally the majority of our constituents
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
want roe v wade to stay intact
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is the new hampshire solution
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's very clear in statute what the
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions are
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
it is not clear what rights women have
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
when it comes to access to care
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
this is our chance to say explicitly
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
that we believe women have a right to an
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
abortion within the limits of the
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
existing statute
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
and i'll take your questions
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
questions for representative simpson
 
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
my question it's more of a thought for
 
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.630 align:start position:0%
my question it's more of a thought for
you

01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea in the states that
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
are now really banning abortions what
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
happens to those the children that
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
wife that or a
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
woman who goes through a full pregnancy
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
but didn't really want to do that
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
because of a lot of the issues that you
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
just spoke of
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
how far
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
the government actually
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
follows or pro-life follows these
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
children do they put them in adoption
 
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.149 align:start position:0%
children do they put them in adoption
areas

01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
what happens to these kids
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
um i don't have statistics about that
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
but i can say that
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
most of the legislation that i've looked
 
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
at in other states does not talk about
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
what happens to the child after the
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
child is born
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
legislative

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
options for child care and to help with
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
with children after they're born for
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
families who are struggling but i don't
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
other questions represented mclean
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
what this legislation will do basically
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
it will trump roe and so what it does is
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
it falls back on our rsas so abortions
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
are legal except as restricted by these
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
existing rsas which i don't have a huge
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
amount of familiarity with but you did
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
mention in your testimony that the
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
24-week ban
 
01:17:20.159 --> 01:17:20.950 align:start position:0%
24-week ban
would

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
still be allowable if this was to pass
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm just trying to understand
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
where these rsas put us relative to role
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
do they basically maintain the status
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
quo of where roe is do they make it more
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
difficult less difficult relative to the
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
current state just trying to get a feel
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
sure so currently
 
01:17:44.719 --> 01:17:45.910 align:start position:0%
sure so currently
um

01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
row is still in
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
is still a constitutionally protected
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
rate so
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
but what this does is it doesn't refer
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
specifically to rows so that if row
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
falls we've stated clearly in the
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
statutes the protections that we would
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
like as a state for women and girls in
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
and so that's why it refers to the
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
statute that we already have on the book
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
so right right now we do have access to
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
abortion up until 24 weeks in new
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire and this would just put the
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
rights that women have right next to the
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions in the statute
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you haven't filled out a pink card
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
you need to do that too
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
i will thank you thank you
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative whitley uh senator
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair and members of the
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
becky whitley and i'm honored to
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
represent senate district 15
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
including the wonderful communities of
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
concord henniker hopkinton and warner
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
i'm grateful to testify in support of
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
this bill and thank the prime sponsor
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
for bringing forth such an important
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
in the coming year as the u.s supreme
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
court sends the right to an abortion
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
back to individual state legislatures
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
each individual state will need to make
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
a decision
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
to continue to chip away at reproductive
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
rights and pass abortion bans or to
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
protect abortion access
 
01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
and this bill asks what will our
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
decision be
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
the power that we hold to build new
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire policy
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
that shapes future generations that
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
supports a modern workforce to compete
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
in a modern economy
 
01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
i personally think we don't need to wait
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
and see to
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
what the supreme courts decide to do we
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
do not need to wait for nine justices
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
before we as new hampshire legislators
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
stand up for granite staters
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity in this bill
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
that proactively protects abortion
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
access in new hampshire and still
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
preserves what the majority passed last
 
01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.510 align:start position:0%
preserves what the majority passed last
year

01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
so many of you might think that abortion
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
won't ever be banned in new hampshire
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
but i would ask you to look around the
 
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:08.950 align:start position:0%
but i would ask you to look around the
country

01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
it's already happening
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
states aren't waiting for the supreme
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
court's decision before passing abortion
 
01:20:14.639 --> 01:20:15.990 align:start position:0%
court's decision before passing abortion
restrictions

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
right now in state houses across the
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
country there are bills being considered
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
for six
 
01:20:22.239 --> 01:20:23.189 align:start position:0%
for six

01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%

01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
15-week bans
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%

arkansas south dakota
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
and indiana are all debating these bills
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
and i want to speak to this issue
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
in a more personal way
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
as a woman still in my reproductive
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
years as a mother and as a granite
 
01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.430 align:start position:0%
years as a mother and as a granite
stater

01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
stater
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
i am truly terrified about what the
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
future of abortion access
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
looks like across the country
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
as well as here in our home state
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'm terrified
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
politicians will be able to decide the
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
course of my future
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
and the future of an entire generation
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
i'm terrified
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
politicians will be able to force me
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
and my contemporaries to carry
 
01:21:11.679 --> 01:21:12.950 align:start position:0%
and my contemporaries to carry
pregnancies

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
pregnancies
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
against our will
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is ultimate
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
governmental overreach and to me it
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
feels dystopian
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
make it clear that we are not in this
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
bill trying to legislate on a
 
01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.229 align:start position:0%
bill trying to legislate on a
hypothetical

01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
and this is not hyperbole
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
without question we are at a crisis
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
moment in our country because roe v wade
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
will very likely be overturned by the
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
u.s supreme court in
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.790 align:start position:0%
june as someone born after roe was
decided

01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
decided
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
i could never have imagined we'd be in
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
this place
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
but we are
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's hard to imagine that a generation
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
behind me some of your daughters and
 
01:21:55.199 --> 01:21:56.550 align:start position:0%
behind me some of your daughters and
granddaughters

01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
granddaughters
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
will not have the same rights that i
 
01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.830 align:start position:0%
will not have the same rights that i
have

01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
rights that my mother
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
your mothers your grandmothers my
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
grandmothers fought so hard for
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
these are rights that allowed me to go
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
to college go to law school
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
marry my equal
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
build a career i'm deeply proud of
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
run for office
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
and have a child who i adore above all
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
else when i was ready to be his mother
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
to be perfectly clear
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
abortion bans are stepping stones
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
24 weeks becomes 20
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
becomes 15
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
becomes six
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
becomes a ban on abortion entirely
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
even in this session our colleagues your
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the house are considering
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
an extreme six-week abortion ban
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
that is the goal
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
that is the playbook and the playbook
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
has unfortunately been successful in
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
eroding reproductive rights around the
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
country and here in new hampshire
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
again as a native granite stater i could
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
never have imagined that new hampshire
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
a state whose identity is so deeply
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
rooted in individual freedom would have
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
an abortion ban but here we are
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
but we have the opportunity to stop that
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
playbook and take a different path that
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
is uniquely suited for our beloved state
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
now is the time to do the right thing
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
now is the time to enact state level
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
protections to ensure that abortion
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
remains safe
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
legal and accessible no matter what
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
happens to
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
roe i think it's also important to point
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
out that we need a bill like this
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
to protect our fragile maternal health
 
01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:40.950 align:start position:0%
to protect our fragile maternal health
system

01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
i'm on the senate judiciary committee
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
and we have heard significant testimony
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
from our medical
 
01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.310 align:start position:0%
from our medical
community

01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
that enshrining the right to have an
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
abortion into state law is an important
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
factor for future providers
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
we know how uncertain the future is for
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
reproductive health and rights in new
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%

01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
they are now looking around at states
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
where their profession is respected
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
and their decisions are trusted
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
but as states ban abortion and
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
criminalize their profession why would
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
the best and brightest want to be in
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
these hostile states
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
and i want to call attention to what our

commissioner shivanet said at a recent
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
october 27
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
executive council needed
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
when she was asked about our fragile
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
maternal health
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
system she replied
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
i quote i think that it makes sense that
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
specialty and sub-specialty providers
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
would typically settle in states that
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
are more supportive and less restrictive
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
around family planning and abortion
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
the more restrictive we become the less
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
attractive new hampshire becomes for
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
those specialties end quote
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
to me that is unacceptable
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
to compete in a modern world to attract
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
young people in new hampshire which we
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
so desperately need to do we have to do
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
something about that
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
every granite stater should have access
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
to the health care that they need
 
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
including abortion without governmental
 
01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.790 align:start position:0%
including abortion without governmental
interference

01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
interference
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
so i would ask you
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
if you believe
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
that every individual should have the
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
right to make a personal private health
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
care decision
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
you should support this bill
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
if you support
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
nearly 50 years of supreme court
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
jurisprudence on abortion access
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
you should support this bill
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
and if you truly care about privacy
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
you should support this bill
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony i'm
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%

legislation
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
let's get to what this bill does not do
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
to answer the representative's earlier
 
01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.709 align:start position:0%

first the bill does not reverse rsa 329

that's the law that went into effect

so what does this bill do
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
as more eloquently summarized
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
the bill codifies the right to access

abortion care
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
it enshrines into law the requirement
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
that an individual may exercise their

provisions we just reviewed

01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
granite staters that liberty is truly a
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%

when and if creating a family is the
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
right decision for them

brightest professionals to our state
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%

01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
it will permit child varying people to
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
more fully engage in our economy to
 
01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:31.280 align:start position:0%

the best and most productive use of
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
their time and energy
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
as a member of house ways and means i
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
have heard joint economic briefings in
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
which experts for from our state and
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
other and throughout the region
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
have identified a stalled economy within
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
because many people that dropped out of
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
the workforce due to the pandemic have
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
not returned
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
state track demographics show that a
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the missing
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
workforce is in fact women
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
and i believe
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
oh it is believed that women are not
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
re-entering the workforce because
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
they're staying home to care for
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
children or family given child care
 
01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.270 align:start position:0%
children or family given child care
shortages

01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
shortages
 
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
this law could be one of the tools new
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire puts into its toolbox to help
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
our economy reach full employment levels
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
and to help solve one piece of that
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage that plagues our
 
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.270 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage that plagues our
state

01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
and remember
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
this bill reflects the majority of
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
public opinion that abortion care should
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
be accessible to all americans as
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
evidenced by pulling data
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
this bill will affect
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
will reflect the will of the granite
 
01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.189 align:start position:0%
will reflect the will of the granite
state

01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
so why is this law needed now
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
it comes as no surprise to this
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
committee that the right to abortion
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
care is at issue before the united
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
states supreme court at this moment
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
as an american born after 1973
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
and that road decision
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
i am confronted with a stark reality
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
that my pursuit of life liberty and
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
happiness may soon be thwarted
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
that my right to seek full reproductive
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
health care which has been upheld in law
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
for 49 years may suddenly be restricted
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
the decision in dobbs v jackson is
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
expected as you've heard sometime this
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
spring possibly
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
this june by the united states supreme
 
01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:28.709 align:start position:0%
this june by the united states supreme
court

01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
so there is urgency among those who pay
 
01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.070 align:start position:0%
so there is urgency among those who pay
attention

01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
to codify the right to abortion access
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the state at the state level
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
at a time when many states are
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
preemptively restricting access the
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill are asking you the
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
not to expand an existing right
 
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
but rather to agree to secure the
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
current state of law and statute to make
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
sure that the individual's access to
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
abortion care in new hampshire does not
 
01:30:54.639 --> 01:30:55.910 align:start position:0%
abortion care in new hampshire does not
change

01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
the time to act is now
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
so before this summer scotus decision is
 
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
issued your committee has the
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ensure that new hampshire
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
is one of the states that protect access
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
to abortion care
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire waits until after that
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
decision comes down
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
it may mean that pregnant people here in
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
the state are denied the right to seek
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
an abortion either temporarily or
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
permanently within the state
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
this obviously has a potential for
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
irreparable harm to granite staters to
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
your neighbors to your family members
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
and to your community
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
so i urge the community to adopt this
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
bill's otp i welcome any questions you
 
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.120 align:start position:0%

i think that is all of the sponsors so
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
we now call upon those who have signed
 
01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.590 align:start position:0%
we now call upon those who have signed
up

01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%

01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
to speak and limit them to three minutes
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
yes and the first person that we will
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
call upon
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and i believe i am one
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the co-founders
 
01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
just to clarify
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%

01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh i rise today in support of hb 1674.
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
this bill the access to abortion care
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
act is a thoughtful necessary and
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
popular bill
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are less familiar
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
with the bill the general idea is that
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
it codifies into loft roe v wade the
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
landmark case that made abortion legal
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
in all 50 states about a half a century
 
01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:30.149 align:start position:0%
in all 50 states about a half a century
ago

01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
before i was born
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
if passed into law abortion would remain
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
safe legal and accessible in most cases
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire regardless of what
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
happens at the u.s supreme court and
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
just to clarify
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
right now roe versus wade is is the
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
supreme court case that is protecting
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
women's right to an abortion up to
 
01:32:48.159 --> 01:32:49.510 align:start position:0%
women's right to an abortion up to
viability

01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
viability
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
and if the supreme court were to
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
overturn that then state statute would
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
become important which is why we are
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that while i
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
remain deeply opposed to the 24-week ban
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
and mandatory ultrasound requirement
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
passed last year the legislation before
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
you does not seek to amend or repeal
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
that ban in any way or any existing new

hampshire abortion restrictions this
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
legislation specifically honors existing
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
state law and does not seek to override
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
it what it does seek to do is enshrine
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
in our state statutes a right to a safe
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
and legal abortion up to 24 weeks of
 
01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.310 align:start position:0%
and legal abortion up to 24 weeks of
pregnancy

01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
i have heard from many of my colleagues
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the aisle that they
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
support roe vs wade
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
well here is your chance to show that
 
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.950 align:start position:0%
well here is your chance to show that
support

01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill would mean we
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
joined 15 other states and the district
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
of columbia in protecting abortion
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
rights all of our neighboring states
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
affirmatively recognize and protect the
 
01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
right to an abortion in their state law
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%

rhode island and new york
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
for years i have heard we don't need
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
this in new hampshire
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
we are a unique state that values
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
privacy and has bipartisan support for
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
abortion rights
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
for many years that was indeed the case
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
but friends i think we can all recognize
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
that times have changed we do need this
 
01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.030 align:start position:0%
that times have changed we do need this
now

01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
we are on the verge of this country
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
overturning 50 years of a constitutional
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
right to a safe and legal abortion
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
i look around this room and i see other
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
women in office
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
other women that are accomplishing
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
things in their own right
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
i know that the makeup of this room
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
is only because women have been able to
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
take hold of their futures by
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
controlling their own body and their own
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
destiny and that means being able to
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
decide when if and how they have
 
01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:39.750 align:start position:0%
decide when if and how they have
children

01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
the position i am in
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
and others are in as state senators and
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
state representatives is awe-inspiring
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
i'm grateful for the freedom and
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
reproductive health and other choices
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
but come june
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
when roe versus wade could be gone we in
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire will know 15 seconds
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
be able to ignore
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
the reality
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
of the altered landscape of care
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
providers in new hampshire are preparing
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
for a world where many patients and
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
those who can afford it will leave the
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
state to receive service
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
our providers have told us they've
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
already seen patients from texas at
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
their health care centers senator if you
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
could just finish up that would
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
chair i didn't realize there was a time
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
restriction i was just going to finish
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
my statement well we're still going to
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
hold you to the three minutes even if
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
you didn't realize it so
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
i know that this is a personal issue
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
i know that some of you are
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable even hearing about this
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
bill or talking about abortion
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
emotions can run high and beliefs are
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
strong and that's okay
 
01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.350 align:start position:0%
strong and that's okay
senator

01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
can you finish
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
sure the other senator was allowed to
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
make their full statement so i'm going
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
can you just finish up sure i will
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
finish up
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
i am a co-sponsor so i'm going to finish
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
my statement our job is to put aside our
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
personal beliefs and do what is best for
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
our constituents and for the future of
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
we must trust women and health care
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
providers we must remember our granite
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
state values of personal privacy and
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
individual liberty and we must recognize
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of our country
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
and our state support abortion rights
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's actually not a divisive issue at
 
01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.750 align:start position:0%
it's actually not a divisive issue at

so you've already heard today but i'll
reiterate

01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
reiterate
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
by june of this year four months from
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
now the u.s supreme court could overturn
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
the landmark roe v wade decision which
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
would result in 26 states immediately
 
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
acting or moving to ban abortion
 
01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:20.790 align:start position:0%
acting or moving to ban abortion
outright

01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
outright
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
this isn't hyperbole this isn't a scare
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
tactic we're talking about 36 million
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
women which is half of the women in the
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
united states of reproductive age
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
losing access to abortion care in their
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
home state within this year
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
and we're already seeing what that looks
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
like in texas
 
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire health centers have
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
already seen patients from texas
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
as more states ban to move to ban
 
01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:48.149 align:start position:0%
as more states ban to move to ban
abortion

01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
patients if they have the money if they
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
have child care if they have the time
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
off of work
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to travel to
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
another state to access the care that
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
they need and we know that this will not
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
be an option for everyone
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
so for many of them they're going to be
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
forced to remain pregnant against their
 
01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.430 align:start position:0%
forced to remain pregnant against their
will

01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
and to carry that pregnancy against
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
their will
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
to be clear there is no one type of
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
abortion story that i could tell you one
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
in four women in the u.s will have an
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
abortion by the time she is 45 years old
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
and who that person is completely varies
 
01:39:20.159 --> 01:39:21.669 align:start position:0%
and who that person is completely varies
59

01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%

01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
already have a child
 
01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.709 align:start position:0%
already have a child
24

01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%

01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
identify as catholic
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
there is no one abortion story or one
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
abortion patient
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
now here in new hampshire for decades we
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
have enjoyed bipartisan support of
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights including abortion
 
01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.310 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights including abortion
access

01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
that support has been shown through
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
polling of voters but also through our
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
elected officials
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
in 1997 governor shaheen signed the bill
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
that repeals the pre-row abortion
 
01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:49.669 align:start position:0%
that repeals the pre-row abortion
restrictions

01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
and she did that with republican
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
majorities in both the house and the
 
01:39:53.679 --> 01:39:54.709 align:start position:0%
majorities in both the house and the
senate

01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
who sent her that bill to sign
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
this bill the access to abortion care
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
act in front of you today had bipartisan
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
support in the senate last week
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
abortion access isn't a blue issue or a
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
red issue abortion is an essential and
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
safe health care service one that should
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
be accessible to people seeking it
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
as you heard this bill does not change
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
anything about the 24 week abortion ban
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't touch or amend restrictions
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
instead this bill enshrines a person's
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
ability to access abortion into state
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
law prohibiting the government from
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
interfering with a patient's access to
 
01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:30.790 align:start position:0%
interfering with a patient's access to
abortion

01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire needs to provide critical
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
protections to ensure that granite state
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
women and families can work with their
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
doctors to get the health care they need
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the majority of situations this is an
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to enshrine the test 15
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
seconds of the roe v wade decision into
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
state law which is something the
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
majority of granite staters want to see
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%

uh good morning mr chairman members of
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
the community thank you so much for the
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh most of the reasons that we support
 
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh strongly supported hb 1674 have
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
already been noted so i'll just give uh
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a personal story so i've
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
worked on similarities issues i'm from
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
up north but have worked in the south
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
for most of the last decade
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
including on abortion access in the deep
 
01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.669 align:start position:0%
including on abortion access in the deep
south

01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
south
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
i think one thing that why it's so
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
important that new hampshire use this
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to draw a line in the sand
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
to say that going forward we will ensure
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
the basic right to reproductive health
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
care in new hampshire
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
is that as senator whitley alluded you
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
know in the south where we're seeing six
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
week bans trigger laws et cetera they
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
didn't start out with those they started
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
out with trap provisions they started
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
out with 20 week plus bands they started
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
out with parental notification laws they
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
started out with funding restrictions
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
and now look we're at just a few years
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
later so i think it's important that
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
this committee take the opportunity to
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
enshrine this in state law and um or to
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
move the process forward to inchiness
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
and state law and thank you for the
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you were there any questions for
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
mr nack
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of the
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%

director for the new hampshire women's
foundation

01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
we support hb 1674 because we believe
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
that women and all people who can become
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
pregnant should have access to the full
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
range of reproductive services including
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
abortion we believe that it is crucial
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire take this step now
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
because women cannot wait to find out
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
what happens at the federal level we
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
must make a commitment to new hampshire
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
women to save legal and accessible
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
abortion care in our state
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
we believe that women have the right to
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
make decisions about their bodies their
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
families and their lives but not only is
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
this a choice
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
to end pregnancy or right but it is for
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
some a means to economic prosperity
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
safety and the ability to flee violence
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to pursue dreams and
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
develop thriving communities or the
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
chance even to protect her own health
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire women are more likely
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
to live in poverty than men are with a
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
gendered wage gap that increases by race
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
ethnicity and geography and they're more
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
likely to have been impacted by
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
interpersonal violence and bisexual
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%

01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%

the ability to make reproductive
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%

01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
the right to seek an abortion
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
essential to women's autonomy health

whereas women with access to
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
reproductive care are more likely to
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
invest in their schooling job training
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%

access to abortion care
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation is coming to you all at
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
a critical time we just experienced what
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
was likely the final anniversary of roe
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
v wade before it potentially gets
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
overturned and there's never been a more
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
important time for us to protect the
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
right to abortion here in new hampshire
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
which we know nearly 70 percent of
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
granite staters
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
support to think that we're about to go
 
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
back on nearly 50 years of precedent is
 
01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:58.229 align:start position:0%
back on nearly 50 years of precedent is
shameful

01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
shameful
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
abortion is an incredibly safe medical
 
01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:01.590 align:start position:0%
abortion is an incredibly safe medical
procedure

01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
abortion pills are safer than tylenol
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
without needing to repeat what i said in
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
my last testimony i just want to make
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
one thing crystal clear
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
when roe v wade falls panic will ensue
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
this legislation is the most direct
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
chance we have at providing clarity and
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
preventing that panic and uncertainty
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
among granite staters when that moment
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
comes which is likely to happen in june
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
so it's up to you all
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
will you allow for panic and uncertainty
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
or will you vote in favor with the vast
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
majority of granite staters saying that
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
they want the right to abortion to be
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
protected here in new hampshire
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of what happens at the
 
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.440 align:start position:0%

muffling of the mass for one thing but

01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%

ruth bader ginsburg
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
the decision whether or not to bear a
 
01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.430 align:start position:0%
the decision whether or not to bear a
child

01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
is central to a woman's life
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
to her well-being
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
and dignity
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%

herself

01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
herself
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
when the government controls that
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%

01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
she is being treated as less than a full
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
adult human
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%

abortion
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
and there is reason why women reserve
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
this right
 
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
it is part of our constitution
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
if we revoke this right
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
it will not stop abortions from
 
01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.589 align:start position:0%
it will not stop abortions from
happening

01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
it will only stop safe abortions from
 
01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:11.189 align:start position:0%
it will only stop safe abortions from
happening

01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%

who else can fairly decide when a woman
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
is ready to be a mother other than
 
01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.149 align:start position:0%

01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing across the political
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
spectrum and age demographics that women
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
are deeply concerned
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
about what is happening here in the
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
granite state with regard to
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
access to abortion care and the threats
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:36.149 align:start position:0%

01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
folks who whose ages are much older than
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
mine who are younger than myself are
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
concerned at the erosion of protection
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
for women seeking abortion
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
regardless of what happens to roe
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
women and families
 
01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
seek protection in making choices about
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
what is best for them
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
we also seek that
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
through this
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
we also seek that exceptional health
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
care is maintained in the state of new
 
01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:09.750 align:start position:0%
care is maintained in the state of new
hampshire

01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
and with that we ask that through this
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation it is codified and
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
protected that women have access and
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
families have access to abortion care
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%

01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record i'm margaret
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
dry i'm from plainfield
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
my husband and i 40 years ago started
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
the first crisis pregnancy center in new
 
01:53:50.719 --> 01:53:51.669 align:start position:0%
the first crisis pregnancy center in new
england

01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
england
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's designed to give aid to women who
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
have crisis pregnancies find themselves
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
in a difficult situation
 
01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
there were zero pregnancy centers in
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
1973 when roe vs wade
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
passed was decided and
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
there are thousands across the united
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
states now i believe that we owe it to
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
the women of new hampshire to provide
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
the things that they need to carry a
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
pregnancy to term whether they
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
chose to raise their child or give it up
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
for adoption they are strong enough to
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
do that if they are given the aid and i
 
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
believe that this does not give women
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
enough credit that they can they can
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
manage and get through a situation that
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
may seem difficult at the time there is
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
aid out there for the that is women
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
these days and we should make sure that
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
they get it
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
not that
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
changed so much since 1973 medically and
 
01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:45.830 align:start position:0%
changed so much since 1973 medically and
technology

01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
technologically we know now what goes on
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
in the womb from conception all the way
 
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
to birth we know now when when babies
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
begin to feel pain we know now uh the
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the um just the development that was
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
not available in 1973
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
our laws should reflect that not go back
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
to a
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
primitive standard really from 50 years
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%

04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
business for the afternoon which is
 
04:05:01.269 --> 04:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
house bill 1673
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%

protection act
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
the primary sponsor uh but and before we
 
04:05:13.269 --> 04:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
begin i just indicate
 
04:05:14.790 --> 04:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
for those who haven't been at our
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
earlier hearings that what we've been
 
04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
doing is allowing the sponsors of bills
 
04:05:21.750 --> 04:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
to have five minutes to introduce their
 
04:05:21.760 --> 04:05:22.550 align:start position:0%
to have five minutes to introduce their
bill

04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:05:25.030 --> 04:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
and to speak to their bill
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
we have been limiting testimony
 
04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
for everyone to three minutes so
 
04:05:32.950 --> 04:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
everybody will have an opportunity to be
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
heard here today
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
and so you should plan to do that when
 
04:05:38.950 --> 04:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
you do speak
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
i would note that lots of people turn in
 
04:05:43.590 --> 04:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
04:05:45.189 --> 04:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
and of course we'll read your written
 
04:05:46.870 --> 04:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
testimony but you know what we really
 
04:05:48.630 --> 04:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
want you to do is what we really want to
 
04:05:51.189 --> 04:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
hear is what you have to say personally
 
04:05:53.910 --> 04:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
and how this legislation may affect you
 
04:05:56.309 --> 04:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
so in any event
 
04:05:58.229 --> 04:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call upon the prime sponsor
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill representative smith
 
04:06:02.710 --> 04:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
ask her to introduce the bill and
 
04:06:07.510 --> 04:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:10.950 --> 04:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and it is
 
04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
indeed an honor for me to stand here and
 
04:06:17.830 --> 04:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
able to look at all of my colleagues on
 
04:06:20.150 --> 04:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
the judiciary committee something that
 
04:06:22.150 --> 04:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not able to do and i'm sitting over
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:30.389 --> 04:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
some of you know that
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
over the 25 years since i've been in the
 
04:06:34.950 --> 04:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
legislature i've divided my time between
 
04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
the judiciary committee and the finance
 
04:06:37.600 --> 04:06:38.630 align:start position:0%
the judiciary committee and the finance
committee

04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
the very first committee i was on
 
04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
was judiciary and in
 
04:06:44.000 --> 04:06:46.950 align:start position:0%
was judiciary and in
1997

04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
1997
 
04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
lo and behold right there on the list of
 
04:06:52.710 --> 04:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
bills was a bill
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:01.990 --> 04:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed in all these years
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
except a little bit here and a little
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
bit there the issue is an issue that has
 
04:07:08.870 --> 04:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
appeared before
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:07:12.870 --> 04:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
04:07:15.670 --> 04:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
i say reproductive rights because to me
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
that's how i view
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
the situation many people
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
prefer to use the term
 
04:07:22.880 --> 04:07:25.110 align:start position:0%
prefer to use the term
abortion

04:07:25.110 --> 04:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
04:07:27.510 --> 04:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
i think reproductive rights is more
 
04:07:30.309 --> 04:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
relevant and relevant to this bill also
 
04:07:32.389 --> 04:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
because it has to do with all kinds of
 
04:07:35.670 --> 04:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
things it has to do with education
 
04:07:37.830 --> 04:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
education about human how humans
 
04:07:37.840 --> 04:07:39.189 align:start position:0%
education about human how humans
procreate

04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
procreate
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
education about how men and women can
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
behave responsibly education about
 
04:07:47.670 --> 04:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
access to birth control
 
04:07:50.710 --> 04:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
all of those are issues that help to
 
04:07:53.269 --> 04:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that when a man and a woman
 
04:07:53.279 --> 04:07:55.510 align:start position:0%
make sure that when a man and a woman
decide

04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
decide
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
that yes they
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
would like to have a child and be
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
responsible man and woman both parents
 
04:08:05.510 --> 04:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for that child they can do
 
04:08:07.990 --> 04:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
that in an informed way and over the
 
04:08:08.000 --> 04:08:09.189 align:start position:0%
that in an informed way and over the
years

04:08:09.189 --> 04:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has actually done very
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:20.070 --> 04:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
citizenry and we have historically had
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
access to health education in schools
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore there were
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
fewer situations in new hampshire
 
04:08:31.199 --> 04:08:32.710 align:start position:0%
fewer situations in new hampshire
where

04:08:32.710 --> 04:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:08:36.229 --> 04:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
people were caught unawares
 
04:08:38.550 --> 04:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
abortion is not new
 
04:08:42.550 --> 04:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
we have had abortion since men and women
 
04:08:42.560 --> 04:08:44.309 align:start position:0%
we have had abortion since men and women
procreated

04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
procreated
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
abortion has existed all those years
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
it appears in the bible there are terms
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
where it's acceptable and not acceptable
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
none of what we do here in this
 
04:08:58.389 --> 04:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
04:09:00.630 --> 04:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
is going to change the fact
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
that sometimes pregnancies occur
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
when um
 
04:09:09.189 --> 04:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the best of all possible
 
04:09:11.349 --> 04:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
worlds they shouldn't
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
and ideally we would have prevented that
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily in my very first
 
04:09:17.279 --> 04:09:18.469 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily in my very first
term

04:09:18.469 --> 04:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
there was a young man who was
 
04:09:24.149 --> 04:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
still in college who announced his
 
04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to abortion because he knew
 
04:09:30.149 --> 04:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
girls and he said girls
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
who had abortions because they couldn't
 
04:09:35.110 --> 04:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
fit into their prom dresses
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
and i asked him if he would mind giving
 
04:09:40.950 --> 04:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
me the names and the contact information
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
of those girls because i really wanted
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
to talk to them and he then said well no
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
he really didn't know them he had just
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
heard about it
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
and 25 years later i would say to you
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
that we sit here and we hear the same
 
04:09:58.229 --> 04:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
kinds of things from people on all sides
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
about situations that may or may not be
 
04:10:00.720 --> 04:10:02.149 align:start position:0%
about situations that may or may not be
true

04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get rid of abortion
 
04:10:06.550 --> 04:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
in anything that we do in this
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
legislative body one hopes what we do is
 
04:10:12.550 --> 04:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that we limit abortions
 
04:10:15.910 --> 04:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh as much as possible and that we
 
04:10:17.269 --> 04:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
when it is
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
necessary that people have access to
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
safe abortions
 
04:10:24.630 --> 04:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
so that brings me to my bill
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
i served it on finance for many years
 
04:10:30.149 --> 04:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
and chair of finance and i can't say
 
04:10:32.950 --> 04:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
with a straight face although i will try
 
04:10:35.110 --> 04:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee never gets
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
involved in policy it only deals with
 
04:10:37.520 --> 04:10:38.469 align:start position:0%
involved in policy it only deals with
money

04:10:38.469 --> 04:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
now i said that with a straight face but
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
of course it's not true
 
04:10:44.070 --> 04:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's just as not true was the example i
 
04:10:45.910 --> 04:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
gave a minute before
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
there was never any justification
 
04:10:53.030 --> 04:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
for any language to go into house bill 2
 
04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
having to do with abortion having to do
 
04:10:58.870 --> 04:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
with ultrasound treatments having to do
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
with criminal penalties for doctors
 
04:11:05.910 --> 04:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
having to do with everything uh with
 
04:11:07.349 --> 04:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
the absence of
 
04:11:07.359 --> 04:11:08.710 align:start position:0%
the absence of
exceptions

04:11:08.710 --> 04:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
04:11:12.070 --> 04:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
for rape or incest or other calamitous
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
situations there was no reason at all
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
that that language should have ever been
 
04:11:22.630 --> 04:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2 which is a budget bill
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
there was never a public dime a public
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
nickel or a public penny that went to
 
04:11:30.640 --> 04:11:31.830 align:start position:0%
nickel or a public penny that went to
abortion

04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
04:11:31.840 --> 04:11:33.110 align:start position:0%
abortion
services

04:11:33.110 --> 04:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes to prevention
 
04:11:37.750 --> 04:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
but not to abortion they it should never
 
04:11:39.590 --> 04:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
have occurred
 
04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
a decision like that should have come to
 
04:11:43.990 --> 04:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
a policy committee and it didn't we
 
04:11:44.000 --> 04:11:45.189 align:start position:0%
a policy committee and it didn't we
today

04:11:45.189 --> 04:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:11:46.710 --> 04:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
can undo
 
04:11:49.030 --> 04:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
the procedural and the substantive
 
04:11:49.040 --> 04:11:50.309 align:start position:0%
the procedural and the substantive
damage

04:11:50.309 --> 04:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
damage
 
04:11:52.870 --> 04:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
that was done by including those
 
04:11:52.880 --> 04:11:54.070 align:start position:0%
that was done by including those
sections

04:11:54.070 --> 04:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
sections
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2 that resulted in
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
on in medically on potentially mentally
 
04:12:05.590 --> 04:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessary tests
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
for the woman who was pregnant
 
04:12:07.760 --> 04:12:09.910 align:start position:0%
for the woman who was pregnant
certainly

04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
having to do with criminal penalties for
 
04:12:12.080 --> 04:12:13.189 align:start position:0%
having to do with criminal penalties for
doctors

04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
and eliminating
 
04:12:15.439 --> 04:12:17.349 align:start position:0%
and eliminating
logical

04:12:17.349 --> 04:12:17.359 align:start position:0%
logical
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
perhaps an abortion should be necessary
 
04:12:24.469 --> 04:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
all i am asking you to do today
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
without regards to the three bills
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday and the two bills today that
 
04:12:30.389 --> 04:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
we've heard on this subject
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
is make sure that the new hampshire
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislature behaves with honor and
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
principle and integrity regardless of
 
04:12:42.070 --> 04:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
how you personally feel about the issue
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
of reproductive rights but recognizing
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
that there was no place for this
 
04:12:49.990 --> 04:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
language in house bill 2 it is now in
 
04:12:53.910 --> 04:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
our rsas and we can by adopting this
 
04:12:53.920 --> 04:12:55.349 align:start position:0%
our rsas and we can by adopting this
legislation

04:12:55.349 --> 04:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:12:58.630 --> 04:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
get rid of what was a
 
04:12:58.640 --> 04:13:00.309 align:start position:0%
get rid of what was a
falsely

04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
falsely
 
04:13:03.510 --> 04:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
presented and illogical
 
04:13:06.630 --> 04:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
violation of the rules of this body and
 
04:13:09.910 --> 04:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
i ask you to support
 
04:13:12.550 --> 04:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
this bill so that we can
 
04:13:15.269 --> 04:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
continue to discuss the issue here in
 
04:13:17.830 --> 04:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
judiciary in health and human services
 
04:13:19.750 --> 04:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
in other committees where the subject is
 
04:13:19.760 --> 04:13:20.790 align:start position:0%
in other committees where the subject is
relevant

04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
04:13:23.110 --> 04:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
but not have the finance committee come
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
in and do something that was not based
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
on the merit of the issue and that will
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
do nothing
 
04:13:30.870 --> 04:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
nothing at all
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
to change
 
04:13:35.110 --> 04:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not abortions take place in
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
this state except to say
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
that if they take place they might not
 
04:13:43.030 --> 04:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
be able to be safe
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
and appropriate as they would be i hope
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
i've stayed within my five minutes
 
04:13:49.830 --> 04:13:49.840 align:start position:0%

autonomy of a pregnant person's rights
 
04:15:42.870 --> 04:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
we heard from providers that there are
 
04:15:45.510 --> 04:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
very limited number of obs who can
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
deliver late term fetal abnormality
 
04:15:50.950 --> 04:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
abortion health care
 
04:15:53.830 --> 04:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
and this bill criminalizes them for
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
doing their job
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
leaving this legislation in place makes
 
04:16:01.830 --> 04:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
recruiting and training providers in our
 
04:16:01.840 --> 04:16:02.790 align:start position:0%
recruiting and training providers in our
state

04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:16:04.950 --> 04:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
that much more difficult
 
04:16:07.030 --> 04:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
why would a doctor looking to practice
 
04:16:09.510 --> 04:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
gynecology and obstetrics
 
04:16:11.830 --> 04:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
want to practice in a state where the
 
04:16:14.469 --> 04:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
state has made a hostile environment for
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
practicing reproductive medicine
 
04:16:19.750 --> 04:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
where practicing safe and appropriate
 
04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
abortion health care could result in a
 
04:16:25.110 --> 04:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
class b felony
 
04:16:27.830 --> 04:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
or possibly face fines of up to a
 
04:16:32.070 --> 04:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
repealing this ban
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
is critical for providers whose patients
 
04:16:39.110 --> 04:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
are going through potentially incredibly
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
complex situations
 
04:16:43.510 --> 04:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
they risk facing criminal charges for
 
04:16:45.670 --> 04:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
delivering critical care and patients
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
who are already in stressful situations
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
have to leave their home state to get
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
the care they need
 
04:16:54.950 --> 04:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
the attacks on bodily autonomy are
 
04:16:54.960 --> 04:16:56.550 align:start position:0%
the attacks on bodily autonomy are
relentless

04:16:56.550 --> 04:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
relentless
 
04:16:58.309 --> 04:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
and they are about
 
04:16:58.319 --> 04:16:59.349 align:start position:0%
and they are about
power

04:16:59.349 --> 04:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
power
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
and control
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
who is a fully recognized and whole
 
04:17:04.080 --> 04:17:05.189 align:start position:0%
who is a fully recognized and whole
person

04:17:05.189 --> 04:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
able to make their own decisions about
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
their reproductive health care
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature has inserted itself into
 
04:17:17.030 --> 04:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
the very personal and private medical
 
04:17:20.229 --> 04:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
decisions of pregnant women
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
not just metaphorically but literally as
 
04:17:26.950 --> 04:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
women are forced to endure ultrasounds
 
04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
to even access abortion healthcare
 
04:17:33.429 --> 04:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
it boggles the mind as to why the state
 
04:17:37.030 --> 04:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
insists on a vaginal ultrasound so that
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
a woman can access the oral abortion
 
04:17:43.510 --> 04:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare mifapristone and mesopristol
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
which can safely be used up to the first
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
70 days or 10 weeks of pregnancy
 
04:17:53.910 --> 04:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
but first before you can access
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
that oral healthcare
 
04:18:00.710 --> 04:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
the state insists that you endure an
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
ultrasound and
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
to add insult to injury you pay for it
 
04:18:05.520 --> 04:18:07.429 align:start position:0%
to add insult to injury you pay for it
too

04:18:07.429 --> 04:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
who's in control of that situation
 
04:18:12.149 --> 04:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
who is exercising power
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
it's not the pregnant woman
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
it should not matter if a pregnancy is
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
the result of failed birth control
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
sexual assault
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
incest or decision that best serves the
 
04:18:28.149 --> 04:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
person whose body is actually pregnant
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
a pregnancy is not an invitation for the
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
state to jump in with medical advice
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's no one's business but the person
 
04:18:39.269 --> 04:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
who is pregnant
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's their body
 
04:18:43.990 --> 04:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
and no one here should have any claim on
 
04:18:45.429 --> 04:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
what their very
 
04:18:47.830 --> 04:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
personal reproductive health care
 
04:18:49.189 --> 04:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
options are
 
04:18:51.189 --> 04:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
unless of course
 
04:18:53.510 --> 04:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
the underlying desire
 
04:18:56.630 --> 04:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
is for power and control
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
i strongly urge the committee to repeal
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
the fetal protection act that more
 
04:19:03.830 --> 04:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
accurately should be named the power and
 
04:19:06.950 --> 04:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
control act over pregnant women
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
trust new hampshire women with their
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
pregnancy health care decisions
 
04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
trust doctors to deliver critical care
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
to women without the threat of criminal
 
04:19:16.399 --> 04:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
to women without the threat of criminal
penalty

04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
please vote ought to pass on house bill
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
1673 thank you
 
04:19:24.389 --> 04:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
thank you any question representative
 
04:19:24.399 --> 04:19:26.070 align:start position:0%
thank you any question representative
nodder

04:19:26.070 --> 04:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
nodder
 
04:19:27.750 --> 04:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
can you show me the section in the law
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
where it requires a transvaginal
 
04:19:33.840 --> 04:19:36.070 align:start position:0%
where it requires a transvaginal
ultrasound

04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
ultrasound
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
we have heard testimony in other bills
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
and heard from
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
ob gyns that in order to meet the
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
state's requirement of providing a
 
04:19:48.389 --> 04:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
gestational age someone who is in the
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
first trimester of their pregnancy
 
04:19:54.149 --> 04:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
will not will possibly need a vaginal
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
ultrasound this we know to be true
 
04:19:59.910 --> 04:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you mr chairman but the
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
law that was passed was just to ban
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
abortion in the third trimester
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
in order to access abortion health care
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
a woman has to get an ultrasound they
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:18.960 --> 04:20:20.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:20:24.070 --> 04:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:25.590 --> 04:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you for your testimony
 
04:20:25.600 --> 04:20:27.030 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you for your testimony
today

04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
did i are there any other sponsors who
 
04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
wish to testify that
 
04:20:34.710 --> 04:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps haven't submitted a card
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:20:37.030 --> 04:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to the rest of the
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and again i indicated that we
 
04:20:41.349 --> 04:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
would provide people with three minutes
 
04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
of testimony up to three minutes
 
04:21:09.910 --> 04:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:12.389 --> 04:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon this time
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman gordon and committee
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
for being willing to listen to my uh
 
04:21:18.870 --> 04:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
statements today
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh i first want to clear up a few things
 
04:21:23.110 --> 04:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
that i just heard
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
that a woman has to have an ultrasound
 
04:21:27.199 --> 04:21:28.229 align:start position:0%
that a woman has to have an ultrasound
to

04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:21:30.389 --> 04:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
obtain abortion care
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
there is no ultrasound requirement
 
04:21:35.750 --> 04:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
if they go in for an abortion
 
04:21:37.750 --> 04:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
in the first six months
 
04:21:40.389 --> 04:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
there is no state law that prevents them
 
04:21:43.110 --> 04:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
from having an abortion in the six first
 
04:21:44.309 --> 04:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
six months
 
04:21:46.469 --> 04:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
they don't have to state a reason why
 
04:21:48.630 --> 04:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
they want an abortion they can do it for
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
whatever reason they want the supreme
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
court has given you that right
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
all we have done is follow the
 
04:21:58.950 --> 04:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
work of the supreme court where they
 
04:21:58.960 --> 04:21:59.910 align:start position:0%
work of the supreme court where they
said

04:21:59.910 --> 04:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:22:02.309 --> 04:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
that at a certain point
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
in the development of that child
 
04:22:08.389 --> 04:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
the state has the responsibility
 
04:22:12.070 --> 04:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
to take that life in into consideration
 
04:22:14.229 --> 04:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
when passing laws
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
so that's the first thing that i want to
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
do the other thing i want to talk to you
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
as a legislator
 
04:22:22.710 --> 04:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
it is crazy when we get a law then the
 
04:22:25.750 --> 04:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
next year we see saw and we see saw we
 
04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
don't need to see saul we're pretty
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
smart people working in our committees
 
04:22:32.469 --> 04:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
if there's a problem with the law we
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
don't throw it away
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
we fix it
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
and that's what we did in another
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee i'm on and also the other
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
chamber did
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
the number one
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
the number one idea that i got from
 
04:22:50.710 --> 04:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
people which was so confused about was
 
04:22:53.429 --> 04:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
the abortion requirement
 
04:22:55.349 --> 04:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
so we crafted
 
04:22:56.790 --> 04:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
04:23:01.510 --> 04:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
that clarified that no no
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is required until that 24th
 
04:23:06.479 --> 04:23:07.670 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is required until that 24th
week

04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
week
 
04:23:10.070 --> 04:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay so that i want to make sure we did
 
04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
that we added to an amendment and we
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
fixed the bill
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
it has already passed the senate
 
04:23:19.750 --> 04:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it's on its way
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
to passing the house
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
there is no reason for this bill to be
 
04:23:27.269 --> 04:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
repealed there's no reason to start this
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
seesaw effect of going back and forth
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
every year
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
let's fix the number
 
04:23:36.389 --> 04:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
one concern
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
that we heard
 
04:23:41.349 --> 04:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
and allow that fix to go through
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
and put everything all the fears of this
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
abort of the
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
ultrasound to rest
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
thank you questions
 
04:23:51.670 --> 04:23:51.680 align:start position:0%

is a lawyer who's going to speak that
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
has the language of the amendment and
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
can clearly walk it through with you and
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
how it fixes the different places in law
 
04:24:17.349 --> 04:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
that were confusing
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%

is that an ultrasound must happen for
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
any abortion care before 24 weeks
 
04:24:48.389 --> 04:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
regardless of what amendment has passed
 
04:24:51.750 --> 04:24:51.760 align:start position:0%

thank
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:26.070 --> 04:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:25:29.830 --> 04:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
is it
 
04:25:29.840 --> 04:25:30.710 align:start position:0%
is it
true

04:25:30.710 --> 04:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:25:33.750 --> 04:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
that the existing law as written
 
04:25:36.550 --> 04:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
already clarifies
 
04:25:39.429 --> 04:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
what this what the senate amendment has
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
but it just does it in the the penalty
 
04:25:42.560 --> 04:25:43.510 align:start position:0%
but it just does it in the the penalty
phase

04:25:43.510 --> 04:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
phase
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
what the senate amendment does is it
 
04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
takes that language and it also
 
04:25:49.510 --> 04:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
duplicates it up front
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
but that the existing law as written
 
04:25:54.790 --> 04:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
already says
 
04:25:56.710 --> 04:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
this what you're saying that the if
 
04:25:59.830 --> 04:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
you're in that 24-week window you have
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
to have
 
04:26:03.750 --> 04:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound for enforcement reasons
 
04:26:06.149 --> 04:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
but if you're in your six week seventh
 
04:26:08.790 --> 04:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
week eighth week you do not have to have
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound and that is in the
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
current version of the bill is that
 
04:26:12.800 --> 04:26:14.070 align:start position:0%
current version of the bill is that
correct

04:26:14.070 --> 04:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:26:16.790 --> 04:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
um i i believe i understood where you
 
04:26:19.910 --> 04:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
were going yes no ultrasound is required
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
in week 5 6 7 8
 
04:26:25.590 --> 04:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
10 12 whatever going forward until you
 
04:26:28.630 --> 04:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
hit 24. when they are reasonably when
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
they're not sure
 
04:26:33.269 --> 04:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
and actually this is a is a tool that
 
04:26:35.349 --> 04:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
that can protect the doctor
 
04:26:38.229 --> 04:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
because if somebody says oh you did an
 
04:26:40.710 --> 04:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
abortion too late he can say no
 
04:26:43.830 --> 04:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
here is the ultrasound we did and it
 
04:26:46.229 --> 04:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
shows that this child was only at a
 
04:26:46.239 --> 04:26:48.469 align:start position:0%
shows that this child was only at a
gestational

04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
gestational
 
04:26:52.389 --> 04:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
place at 22 or 23 weeks
 
04:26:53.670 --> 04:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:26:56.790 --> 04:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
sing then thank you for your testimony
 
04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:18.070 --> 04:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.990 --> 04:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you members
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%

representative of both the towns of
 
04:27:31.189 --> 04:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
hanover and lime i'd just like to start
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
with a quick anecdote
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
about two weeks ago a physician at
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
dartmouth-hitchcock medical center
 
04:27:37.990 --> 04:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
reached out to me and asked me if i had
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
heard about this new abortion law that
 
04:27:42.070 --> 04:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
was going to go into effect soon
 
04:27:44.149 --> 04:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
and that she asked me did you know that
 
04:27:45.910 --> 04:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
our ob gyns
 
04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
could go to jail if this law passes
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
i informed her
 
04:27:52.389 --> 04:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
no no i'm so sorry you're mistaken that
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
law is in existence right now
 
04:27:57.349 --> 04:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
our physicians can go to jail right now
 
04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
for performing abortions
 
04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
her response to me was just a complete
 
04:28:02.159 --> 04:28:03.750 align:start position:0%
her response to me was just a complete
astonishment

04:28:03.750 --> 04:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
astonishment
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
and she asked me is there anything we
 
04:28:06.630 --> 04:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
can do
 
04:28:08.229 --> 04:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
the answer to that doctor's question is
 
04:28:08.239 --> 04:28:09.349 align:start position:0%
the answer to that doctor's question is
yes

04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:28:13.349 --> 04:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
this committee can pass hb 1673.
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
so what does this bill do
 
04:28:18.309 --> 04:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
it repeals those subsections of rsa 329
 
04:28:19.750 --> 04:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
colon 43
 
04:28:19.760 --> 04:28:21.990 align:start position:0%
colon 43
250.

04:28:21.990 --> 04:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
250.
 
04:28:23.830 --> 04:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
the proportion of the portion of this
 
04:28:25.510 --> 04:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
chapter that regulates physicians and
 
04:28:27.189 --> 04:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
surgeons in new hampshire specifically
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act
 
04:28:31.349 --> 04:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh it was we've all talked about it it's
 
04:28:34.830 --> 04:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
the what's known as the 24-week abortion
 
04:28:37.590 --> 04:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
ban couple of points of the sub
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
subsections that i'd like to point out
 
04:28:41.590 --> 04:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
is that this does establish criminal
 
04:28:43.269 --> 04:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
penalties for providers that perform
 
04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
abortions after 24 week period
 
04:28:48.149 --> 04:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
it also weighs hefty fines of not less
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
than ten thousand dollars and not more
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
than a hundred thousand dollars plus
 
04:28:54.950 --> 04:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
court costs for each violation
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
in addition it establishes a civil right
 
04:28:58.790 --> 04:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
of action to claim monetary damages and
 
04:28:58.800 --> 04:29:00.550 align:start position:0%
of action to claim monetary damages and
mandates

04:29:00.550 --> 04:29:00.560 align:start position:0%

04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing
 
04:29:03.510 --> 04:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
a review of health care providers
 
04:29:05.030 --> 04:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
licensing by the new hampshire board of
 
04:29:07.670 --> 04:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
medicine when those physicians go before
 
04:29:09.189 --> 04:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine they're going to
 
04:29:11.429 --> 04:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
have a vaginal ultrasound record in the
 
04:29:13.910 --> 04:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
patient's notes to ensure that they were
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
correct about that 24-week analysis
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
so it may not be the choice of the woman
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
or the schedule but in fact you will
 
04:29:24.309 --> 04:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
find physicians will opt
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
for that procedure
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
under this law
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
if enacted what does this law mean
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
here's a few things it will restore new
 
04:29:34.229 --> 04:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire's long history of honoring
 
04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
granite stater's individual liberty by
 
04:29:38.149 --> 04:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
removing the extreme abortion ban on the
 
04:29:39.670 --> 04:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
books now
 
04:29:41.429 --> 04:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
we know that this bill is deeply
 
04:29:43.269 --> 04:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
unpopular with the new hampshire public
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
as 66 percent of granite staters
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
currently support abortion access
 
04:29:50.149 --> 04:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
third there's bipartisan support for
 
04:29:52.149 --> 04:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
repeal of this bill we know that gop
 
04:29:53.830 --> 04:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
leadership including governor sununu
 
04:29:55.990 --> 04:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
himself has gone on the record stating
 
04:29:58.870 --> 04:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
that exceptions for rape and incest
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
for that mandated vaginal ultrasound and
 
04:30:02.469 --> 04:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
decriminalization of our state's
 
04:30:04.550 --> 04:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
physicians is critical
 
04:30:06.389 --> 04:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
fourth we know the existing
 
04:30:06.399 --> 04:30:07.349 align:start position:0%
fourth we know the existing
law

04:30:07.349 --> 04:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:30:09.429 --> 04:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
has attracted undesirable medical
 
04:30:09.439 --> 04:30:10.550 align:start position:0%
has attracted undesirable medical
attention

04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
attention
 
04:30:12.790 --> 04:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
and that would all fall away as well
 
04:30:14.790 --> 04:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
if you could finish the exemplary work
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
of our state's ob gyns by demonstrating
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
that the state supports the
 
04:30:20.229 --> 04:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
administration of life-saving health
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
care and it will recruit future
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
generations of the best and brightest
 
04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
physicians to work here in our state
 
04:30:28.149 --> 04:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do okay urge you
 
04:30:30.269 --> 04:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
to pass otp
 
04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239 align:start position:0%

04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and members
 
04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
04:30:56.229 --> 04:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
my name is matthew simon i'm a
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative from grafton district 14.
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here in opposition uh to this bill
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start off because i only
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
have three minutes if you do have
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
questions about how the ultrasound
 
04:31:06.239 --> 04:31:07.510 align:start position:0%
questions about how the ultrasound
requirement

04:31:07.510 --> 04:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
works within this law i am educated on
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
that and i'm able to answer whatever
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
questions you might have on that um
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
but in the short amount of time that i
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
have i would just like to bring up not
 
04:31:18.229 --> 04:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
so much what i have heard from from
 
04:31:19.750 --> 04:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill but what i have
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
not heard from them and what i never
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
seem to hear in these situations which
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
is whether or not
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
the victims of these procedures that
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about are in fact human
 
04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
beings or not
 
04:31:32.790 --> 04:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
there's a specific reason why the
 
04:31:34.870 --> 04:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
supreme court limited the constitutional
 
04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
right to an abortion and therefore the
 
04:31:38.950 --> 04:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to privacy
 
04:31:41.590 --> 04:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
first in roe versus wade at the third
 
04:31:43.750 --> 04:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
trimester mark but then seeing that as
 
04:31:45.189 --> 04:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
insufficient during planned parenthood
 
04:31:46.950 --> 04:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
versus casey they backed out to
 
04:31:48.790 --> 04:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
viability where it has stood to this
 
04:31:50.229 --> 04:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
the reason why they did that is because
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
they recognized what is painfully
 
04:31:53.520 --> 04:31:55.030 align:start position:0%
they recognized what is painfully
obvious

04:31:55.030 --> 04:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
obvious
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
we are human beings before we are born
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
there is a point at in time before we
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
come out of our mother where we are in
 
04:32:04.630 --> 04:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
fact human beings
 
04:32:06.389 --> 04:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
to take any other position is
 
04:32:08.790 --> 04:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
scientifically indefensible
 
04:32:11.670 --> 04:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
and so the reason why the state is able
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
to intercede at this particular point in
 
04:32:15.030 --> 04:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
time is the same reason the state is
 
04:32:17.189 --> 04:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
able to intercede at any time when one
 
04:32:18.550 --> 04:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
human being
 
04:32:20.790 --> 04:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
is trying to harm the life of another
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
human being
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
the state is the one who has legal
 
04:32:27.750 --> 04:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
standing to to intercede when
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
anybody who's out walking around is is
 
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
going to harm another human being
 
04:32:34.229 --> 04:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
and so the supreme court looked out and
 
04:32:35.590 --> 04:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
said well somebody has to have legal
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
standing to protect this child if the
 
04:32:38.790 --> 04:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
mother isn't going to do it and if the
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
doctor is not going to do it then
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
somebody has to have legal standing and
 
04:32:44.070 --> 04:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
who has the legal standing the state has
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
the legal standing
 
04:32:46.950 --> 04:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
and so the state gets involved not
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
because we
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
i have a mother i have sisters i have
 
04:32:54.550 --> 04:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
friends who are women i have no desire
 
04:32:56.229 --> 04:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
to control them
 
04:32:57.750 --> 04:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
what i do want
 
04:33:00.189 --> 04:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that we are doing our
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility as the state to protect
 
04:33:07.990 --> 04:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
every single living human being that is
 
04:33:10.230 --> 04:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
under our care
 
04:33:13.029 --> 04:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
at 24 weeks gestation and onward we are
 
04:33:14.709 --> 04:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
fully developed
 
04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
completely fully developed down to
 
04:33:16.639 --> 04:33:18.390 align:start position:0%
completely fully developed down to
fingerprints

04:33:18.390 --> 04:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
fingerprints
 
04:33:21.189 --> 04:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
if given the chance to be born
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
the majority of people at 24 weeks will
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
survive but remember this bill doesn't
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
just cover people at 24 weeks it covers
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
us all the way up till birth so this
 
04:33:31.109 --> 04:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
could be a 39 week old child and if
 
04:33:31.119 --> 04:33:32.230 align:start position:0%
could be a 39 week old child and if
anybody

04:33:32.230 --> 04:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
who is a proponent of this bill would
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
like to clarify for me using scientific
 
04:33:38.070 --> 04:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
language the difference between the
 
04:33:39.910 --> 04:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
child a moment after it's born and a
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
child five minutes before it's born and
 
04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
what the magical difference between
 
04:33:46.230 --> 04:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
those two people is i'm more than happy
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
to hear that and have 15 seconds
 
04:33:49.279 --> 04:33:50.869 align:start position:0%
to hear that and have 15 seconds
so

04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
unless yeah
 
04:33:55.750 --> 04:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights is a misnomer
 
04:34:01.349 --> 04:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
reproduction has already taken place it
 
04:34:03.429 --> 04:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
happens at conception what happens after
 
04:34:05.750 --> 04:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
that isn't technically reproduction it's
 
04:34:07.590 --> 04:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
nurture of some form or another
 
04:34:09.189 --> 04:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
willingly or non-willingly that's
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
essentially what the mother is doing at
 
04:34:11.670 --> 04:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
that particular okay representative
 
04:34:12.551 --> 04:34:12.561 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:15.830 --> 04:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
question representative otter
 
04:34:17.189 --> 04:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
04:34:20.629 --> 04:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony today
 
04:34:22.390 --> 04:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
um could you please expound on the
 
04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
ultrasound requirement yes okay so the
 
04:34:27.189 --> 04:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
ultrasound requirement um
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%
i and i understand the confusion for it
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
and i testified uh to that point in
 
04:34:33.429 --> 04:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
health and human services as well um
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
when you when you isolate the part of
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
the law that talks about the ultrasound
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
requirement there is no limiting factor
 
04:34:40.470 --> 04:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
to that ultrasound requirement so when
 
04:34:41.990 --> 04:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
you read it it seems like
 
04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
an ultrasound is required at all times
 
04:34:45.910 --> 04:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
and so i think that you could come to
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
that conclusion if you're not a lawyer
 
04:34:49.269 --> 04:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
you're not in the judicial system in
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
good faith
 
04:34:52.629 --> 04:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
what the bill does do later on in the
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty section is basically
 
04:34:58.070 --> 04:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
say that there is no criminal penalty
 
04:34:58.080 --> 04:34:59.269 align:start position:0%
say that there is no criminal penalty
unless

04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
unless
 
04:35:01.830 --> 04:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know that the child is 24 weeks old
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
or there is a substantial risk of the
 
04:35:06.310 --> 04:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
child being 24 weeks old
 
04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
and you didn't do an ultrasound um so
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
for the point of the ultrasound is not
 
04:35:13.269 --> 04:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
to pinpoint the age of the child that
 
04:35:15.349 --> 04:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
was never the intent of the bill um and
 
04:35:16.949 --> 04:35:16.959 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it's the actual effect
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
of the bill um so we don't care if the
 
04:35:21.750 --> 04:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
child is six weeks old or seven weeks
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
old or 10 weeks old we simply care that
 
04:35:28.150 --> 04:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
the child is not 24 weeks old or older
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
and so there's no need for a
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound which the
 
04:35:33.990 --> 04:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of that is to really
 
04:35:36.869 --> 04:35:36.879 align:start position:0%
magnify in on a child when it's in its
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
earlier point of development
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's used post-surgery a lot of times to
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that all scar tissue has been
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
removed from the woman things of that
 
04:35:44.799 --> 04:35:45.910 align:start position:0%
removed from the woman things of that
nature

04:35:45.910 --> 04:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
nature
 
04:35:48.310 --> 04:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
but it does no good in determining like
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's just not necessary a regular um
 
04:35:53.590 --> 04:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
external ultrasound will demonstrate
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not that six week old child
 
04:35:57.750 --> 04:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
is 24 weeks or not um it would be very
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
difficult for a trained physician to
 
04:36:02.230 --> 04:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
to confuse the two okay representative
 
04:36:04.070 --> 04:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
knotter did you have a follow-up yes
 
04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um would you mind
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
putting that in writing so i can review
 
04:36:10.869 --> 04:36:10.879 align:start position:0%
it later i believe an esteemed friend of

and the last representative i have is
 
04:36:43.830 --> 04:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.510 --> 04:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
04:36:47.029 --> 04:36:47.039 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues
 
04:36:49.269 --> 04:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
i'm actually submitting this on behalf
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
of josie pinto who had to
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
attend class this afternoon so if i may
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
i am reading this on behalf of josie
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
pinto the abortion ban and ultrasound
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
mandate that went into effect january
 
04:37:02.320 --> 04:37:03.990 align:start position:0%
mandate that went into effect january
1st

04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
1st
 
04:37:05.510 --> 04:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
has already had very harmful
 
04:37:07.510 --> 04:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
consequences for the organization for
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
which i run as an abortion fund that
 
04:37:11.830 --> 04:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
helps patients access critical care at
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
points in pregnancy and supports
 
04:37:16.551 --> 04:37:16.561 align:start position:0%
patients who are in financial duress the
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
abortion ban means that patients will
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
have to travel further for care and
 
04:37:22.869 --> 04:37:22.879 align:start position:0%
endure higher costs
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
this place is a major burden not just on
 
04:37:27.029 --> 04:37:27.039 align:start position:0%
the patients but on our ability to meet
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
the needs of those
 
04:37:30.470 --> 04:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
seeking care
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
to focus on the ultrasound mandate which
 
04:37:34.230 --> 04:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
i believe to be cruel and medically
 
04:37:35.750 --> 04:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary i'd like to give a brief
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
overview of the current landscape of
 
04:37:38.551 --> 04:37:38.561 align:start position:0%
abortion care
 
04:37:40.150 --> 04:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
as of right now patients are able to
 
04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
receive abortion care through a wide
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
variety of means
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
since the year 2000 patients have been
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
able to easily end pregnancy using a
 
04:37:49.119 --> 04:37:50.709 align:start position:0%
able to easily end pregnancy using a
combination

04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
combination
 
04:37:53.670 --> 04:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
of medications five pills to induce
 
04:37:53.680 --> 04:37:55.029 align:start position:0%
of medications five pills to induce
miscarriage

04:37:55.029 --> 04:37:55.039 align:start position:0%
miscarriage
 
04:37:56.709 --> 04:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
because of covid
 
04:37:58.470 --> 04:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
the restricting patient's access to
 
04:38:01.189 --> 04:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
in-person care the fda has approved this
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
medication for telemedicine prescription
 
04:38:04.789 --> 04:38:04.799 align:start position:0%
and administration
 
04:38:07.269 --> 04:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
this it means that patients can access
 
04:38:09.910 --> 04:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
providers by providers via telehealth
 
04:38:09.920 --> 04:38:12.310 align:start position:0%
providers by providers via telehealth
medicine

04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
04:38:15.590 --> 04:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
this allows them to administer abortions
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
safely with their doctors
 
04:38:20.949 --> 04:38:20.959 align:start position:0%
and with the ultimate privacy
 
04:38:23.189 --> 04:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
abortion pills are 95 effective and have
 
04:38:25.590 --> 04:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
lower complication rate
 
04:38:26.949 --> 04:38:26.959 align:start position:0%
than tylenol
 
04:38:28.949 --> 04:38:28.959 align:start position:0%
not only that but a provider shortage of
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
patients have to often have to wait
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
several weeks to find an
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
available appointment time for an
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
in-person provider
 
04:38:37.269 --> 04:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire that means rural
 
04:38:39.910 --> 04:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
patients somehow sometimes have to drive
 
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
two to four hours to a clinic taking
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
time off work
 
04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
to find child care pay for gas and other
 
04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
expenses involved with accessing
 
04:38:48.869 --> 04:38:48.879 align:start position:0%
inpatient care
 
04:38:50.310 --> 04:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
these are massive barriers that we see
 
04:38:51.670 --> 04:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
patients struggling with every single
 
04:38:51.680 --> 04:38:53.990 align:start position:0%
patients struggling with every single
day

04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time i will just say
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
that i she strongly urges to support the
 
04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
repealing of the fetal health protection
 
04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%

muffled so sure but that will be your

04:40:57.990 --> 04:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
ultrasound of the fetal anatomy around
 
04:40:59.670 --> 04:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
20 weeks
 
04:41:01.510 --> 04:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
a screening blood test in the first
 
04:41:04.150 --> 04:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
trimester does not detect all fatal
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
fetal diagnoses
 
04:41:08.628 --> 04:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
not all women choose to do this test and
 
04:41:10.628 --> 04:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
not all women have insurance coverage
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
for it an early ultrasound can miss a
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
fatal fetal diagnosis
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
these women who present for the 20-week
 
04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
anatomic ultrasound are greeting this
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
test with anticipation and excitement
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
if a significant fetal problem is seen
 
04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
the patient has to be scheduled with a
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
specialty obstetrician which can take a
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
few weeks
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
if a genetic abnormality is suspected a
 
04:41:37.830 --> 04:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
procedure called an amniocentesis is
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
offered that extracts fetal cells from
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
the amniotic fluid in the uterus
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
these definitive results can take up to
 
04:41:47.430 --> 04:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
14 days to return
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
it is very possible that a woman and her
 
04:41:52.230 --> 04:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
family is faced with the reality of a
 
04:41:55.510 --> 04:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
fatal fetal diagnosis at or beyond 24
 
04:41:55.520 --> 04:41:56.708 align:start position:0%
fatal fetal diagnosis at or beyond 24
weeks

04:41:56.708 --> 04:41:56.718 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
we then offer information compassion and
 
04:41:59.760 --> 04:42:01.110 align:start position:0%
we then offer information compassion and
choice

04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
many women and their families choose to
 
04:42:05.590 --> 04:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
continue the pregnancy knowing that the
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
fetus will likely die in utero or die
 
04:42:10.628 --> 04:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
shortly after birth
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
some will choose induction of labor with
 
04:42:15.270 --> 04:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
her local obstetric provider in her
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
local hospital with access to her loved
 
04:42:18.000 --> 04:42:19.110 align:start position:0%
local hospital with access to her loved
ones

04:42:19.110 --> 04:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
ones
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
the goal for these women and families is
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
to have the opportunity to meet their
 
04:42:26.070 --> 04:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
baby and continue the grieving process
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
some when there is access to it will
 
04:42:29.990 --> 04:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
just choose a surgical termination of
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
pregnancy the key here is for women to
 
04:42:34.708 --> 04:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
have a choice
 
04:42:36.550 --> 04:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
these choices are met with pain and
 
04:42:36.560 --> 04:42:37.750 align:start position:0%
these choices are met with pain and
sorrow

04:42:37.750 --> 04:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
sorrow
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
a woman should not be forced to continue
 
04:42:43.190 --> 04:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
a pregnancy with a condition
 
04:42:45.190 --> 04:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
these clinical circumstances are rare
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
but the 24-week abortion ban without
 
04:42:49.350 --> 04:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
exemptions for fatal fetal diagnosis
 
04:42:51.190 --> 04:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
does not take into account how every
 
04:42:52.628 --> 04:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is different and every
 
04:42:54.628 --> 04:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
circumstance is unique again i ask for
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
your compassion
 
04:42:58.390 --> 04:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
24 weeks doctor i'm just going to ask
 
04:42:59.910 --> 04:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
you to wrap up sure just one more
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
sentence thank you so much 24 weeks
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
or 24 weeks or beyond elective
 
04:43:07.750 --> 04:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
terminations do not happen in our state
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
the 24 week abortion ban as it stands
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
without restrictions for fatal fetal
 
04:43:14.230 --> 04:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
diagnosis will cause women
 
04:43:16.708 --> 04:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
of our state physical and emotional harm
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
04:43:21.670 --> 04:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for dr al bushi
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative horrigan
 
04:43:24.868 --> 04:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you much
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
doctor did he quite get your doctor
 
04:43:28.470 --> 04:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
danielle what was your last name l
 
04:43:28.480 --> 04:43:29.670 align:start position:0%
danielle what was your last name l
bushy's

04:43:29.670 --> 04:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
bushy's
 
04:43:29.680 --> 04:43:30.868 align:start position:0%
bushy's
okay

04:43:30.868 --> 04:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
and um and of course the law takes a
 
04:43:34.390 --> 04:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
very uh
 
04:43:36.390 --> 04:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
understandably very broad rush view they
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
just have a one line description of
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
conception as you know the
 
04:43:41.110 --> 04:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
fusion of the
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
sperm and the ovum and of course uh as
 
04:43:45.590 --> 04:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know much better than
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
i do or anybody else in the room it's a
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
lot more complicated than that
 
04:43:50.948 --> 04:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
so how
 
04:43:53.430 --> 04:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
what percentage do you the approximate
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
estimate how many what percentage of
 
04:43:56.948 --> 04:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
pregnancies um
 
04:43:58.868 --> 04:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
you know ended either like abort
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
spontaneously or end in fatal
 
04:44:02.868 --> 04:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
abnormalities or otherwise you know
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't go according to plan
 
04:44:08.628 --> 04:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
in the first trimester we believe up to
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
20 percent of pregnancies end in
 
04:44:10.798 --> 04:44:12.230 align:start position:0%
20 percent of pregnancies end in
miscarriage

04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
miscarriage
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
the fatal fetal diagnosis question uh
 
04:44:16.868 --> 04:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
you know is too hard to give an answer
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
to these things are rare um and we take
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
them as they are presented to us um so
 
04:44:22.400 --> 04:44:23.190 align:start position:0%
them as they are presented to us um so
that

04:44:23.190 --> 04:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:24.550 --> 04:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
answer i
 
04:44:26.470 --> 04:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
i would not comment on
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:32.310 --> 04:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr taran thank you very much
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
doctor for taking my question we heard
 
04:44:37.030 --> 04:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
from the representative just a little
 
04:44:39.910 --> 04:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
bit ago he seemed to be pretty
 
04:44:42.868 --> 04:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
well versed in ultrasounds and being
 
04:44:44.550 --> 04:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
able to determine
 
04:44:47.350 --> 04:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
the age of a fetus can you tell me what
 
04:44:50.070 --> 04:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
other way there is besides an ultrasound
 
04:44:51.750 --> 04:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
how you would be able to tell the age of
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
a fetus
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
there there isn't or i mean specifically
 
04:44:58.470 --> 04:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
early on in a first trimester that
 
04:45:00.628 --> 04:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound has to be
 
04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
performed with any accuracy for
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
establishing gestational age
 
04:45:06.948 --> 04:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
although we use a fundal height
 
04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
measurement in our routine prenatal care
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
we would never use a tape measure and a
 
04:45:13.830 --> 04:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
fundal height
 
04:45:14.788 --> 04:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
that may
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to be according to a
 
04:45:18.310 --> 04:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
gestational age in weeks but never
 
04:45:20.948 --> 04:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
without an ultrasound
 
04:45:23.430 --> 04:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
claim to know the gestational age of a
 
04:45:25.750 --> 04:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
fetus i thank you very much for your
 
04:45:27.830 --> 04:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
answer other questions representative
 
04:45:27.840 --> 04:45:28.868 align:start position:0%
answer other questions representative
notter

04:45:28.868 --> 04:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
notter
 
04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:45:32.868 --> 04:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
04:45:34.708 --> 04:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
i've had seven pregnancies and i have
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
never heard of a transvaginal
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is it new
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
a transvaginal you are correct in that
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
many women and many of our patients do
 
04:45:42.958 --> 04:45:43.830 align:start position:0%
many women and many of our patients do
not

04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:45:45.750 --> 04:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
have a transvaginal ultrasound when
 
04:45:48.150 --> 04:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
there's question if a woman presents
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
with bleeding and we don't know how far
 
04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
along she is we'll do an ultrasound if a
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
woman comes to us not knowing how far
 
04:45:57.430 --> 04:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
along she is we'll do an ultrasound
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
which typically is transvaginal early on
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
for women who have
 
04:46:04.230 --> 04:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
uncomplicated pregnancies who are
 
04:46:06.550 --> 04:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
presenting to us for routine prenatal
 
04:46:06.560 --> 04:46:08.470 align:start position:0%
presenting to us for routine prenatal
care

04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
care
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
typically an ultrasound is done but if
 
04:46:11.040 --> 04:46:11.830 align:start position:0%
typically an ultrasound is done but if
that

04:46:11.830 --> 04:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is 13 weeks along or at
 
04:46:15.910 --> 04:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
certain gestational ages we can do a
 
04:46:18.310 --> 04:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
trans abdominal ultrasound
 
04:46:19.910 --> 04:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
so it is true that women who have
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
uncomplicated pregnancies
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
may not even ever have a first trimester
 
04:46:26.310 --> 04:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
ultrasound which is my point in this
 
04:46:29.190 --> 04:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
written testimony that in uncomplicated
 
04:46:29.200 --> 04:46:30.550 align:start position:0%
written testimony that in uncomplicated
pregnancies

04:46:30.550 --> 04:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
pregnancies
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
some women their first ultrasound is
 
04:46:36.310 --> 04:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
routine to have at around 20 weeks when
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
we can see the anatomy
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
for the very first time see
 
04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:46:55.350 --> 04:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you doctor
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:47:01.510 --> 04:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
doctor can you identify for me any other
 
04:47:04.230 --> 04:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
area in medicine where there is the kind
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
of legislative oversight
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:13.590 --> 04:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's occurring in any other part of
 
04:47:13.600 --> 04:47:15.430 align:start position:0%
that's occurring in any other part of
medicine

04:47:15.430 --> 04:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
um that i can you repeat the question
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
please can you identify any other area
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
of medicine that has the same type of
 
04:47:27.990 --> 04:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
legislative scrutiny or oversight in
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
terms of what can actually happen
 
04:47:34.708 --> 04:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
as do do abortions and the cure women's
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
health care yeah
 
04:47:39.030 --> 04:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
that i can't speak to that answer to is
 
04:47:41.110 --> 04:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not well versed in the history of
 
04:47:43.750 --> 04:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
legislative issues for all medicine i've
 
04:47:45.510 --> 04:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
certainly learned a lot about this issue
 
04:47:47.430 --> 04:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
in women's health care recently but i'm
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
sorry that i can't speak of
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:54.948 --> 04:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
issue would apply to other fields of
 
04:47:58.070 --> 04:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
medicine thank you
 
04:47:59.830 --> 04:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone else who has a
 
04:47:59.840 --> 04:48:02.708 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone else who has a
question

04:48:02.708 --> 04:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:04.708 --> 04:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
see thank you again for your testimony
 
04:48:04.718 --> 04:48:06.470 align:start position:0%
see thank you again for your testimony
today

04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:48:35.750 --> 04:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:37.350 --> 04:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
i think you need to press the button on
 
04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
your mic down there
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
there you go now
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee ian hewitt on behalf of
 
04:48:47.788 --> 04:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
cornerstone in opposition to house bill
 
04:48:47.798 --> 04:48:49.430 align:start position:0%
cornerstone in opposition to house bill
1673

04:48:49.430 --> 04:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
1673
 
04:48:51.110 --> 04:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
i have two points i'd like the committee
 
04:48:53.110 --> 04:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
to consider one i've provided the
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
committee with electronic copies of and
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
i have brought physical copies of senate
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
bill 399 as passed by the senate and
 
04:49:04.948 --> 04:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
house bill 1609 as passed by house hhs
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
either of these bills which cornerstone
 
04:49:09.750 --> 04:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
supports would further clarify the very
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
limited scope of the ultrasound
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
requirement in the fetal life protection
 
04:49:13.440 --> 04:49:14.230 align:start position:0%
requirement in the fetal life protection
act

04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
act
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
if any member of this committee has
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that the ultrasound requirement
 
04:49:20.550 --> 04:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
in our current law may be onerous i
 
04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
think that's a mistake and i'd be happy
 
04:49:24.868 --> 04:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
to address that in questioning but in
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
any case either of the bills i mentioned
 
04:49:29.430 --> 04:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
would more than address those concerns
 
04:49:32.310 --> 04:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
if this committee does not itl this bill
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
we would ask as the second best outcome
 
04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
that the committee retained the bill
 
04:49:38.310 --> 04:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
while it wait for the general court to
 
04:49:40.230 --> 04:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
act on either of the bills i just
 
04:49:40.240 --> 04:49:41.350 align:start position:0%
act on either of the bills i just
mentioned

04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:49:43.990 --> 04:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
secondly we think that some may ask this
 
04:49:47.590 --> 04:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
committee to amend 1673 to instead of
 
04:49:49.510 --> 04:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
outright repealing our current law
 
04:49:51.750 --> 04:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
either entirely remove the ultrasound
 
04:49:54.550 --> 04:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
requirement or add in an open-ended
 
04:49:56.948 --> 04:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
health exception either of those changes
 
04:49:59.590 --> 04:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
would make our current law unenforceable
 
04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
and meaningless and we significantly
 
04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
prefer the status quo ante to a purely
 
04:50:08.070 --> 04:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
symbolic law having no law is better
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
than a symbolic law for reasons of
 
04:50:12.948 --> 04:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
clarity and transparency and ultimately
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
we think better for life so to be clear
 
04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
we think house bill 1673
 
04:50:21.990 --> 04:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
seeks to authorize and facilitate crimes
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
against humanity
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
but if this committee is considering
 
04:50:27.990 --> 04:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
either entirely removing the ultrasound
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
requirement or creating an open-ended
 
04:50:32.550 --> 04:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
health exception we and our supporters
 
04:50:35.590 --> 04:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
would prefer as the second worst outcome
 
04:50:37.788 --> 04:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
that this committee otp
 
04:50:40.868 --> 04:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
1673 in its current form and without
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you and i'm happy to
 
04:50:44.470 --> 04:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
04:50:46.390 --> 04:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative notter
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:50:50.550 --> 04:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
taking the question uh mr hewitt um
 
04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
before i ask my question uh we can't
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
retain the bills because this is the
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
second year but we can do an interim
 
04:50:57.510 --> 04:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
study that's an option um my question is
 
04:50:58.708 --> 04:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
what i meant to say representative
 
04:51:01.750 --> 04:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me okay my question is um do
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
other states have a 24-week abortion ban
 
04:51:07.350 --> 04:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
well abortion laws around the country
 
04:51:09.750 --> 04:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
have been in a particular state of flux
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
for the last few years because we've
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
seen especially since 2019
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
a big push in democratic-led states to
 
04:51:19.360 --> 04:51:20.470 align:start position:0%
a big push in democratic-led states to
repeal

04:51:20.470 --> 04:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
modest late-term abortion bans and
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
authorize abortion up to birth it used
 
04:51:28.230 --> 04:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
to be just a few years ago before 2019
 
04:51:30.070 --> 04:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
when you looked at the spectrum of laws
 
04:51:32.708 --> 04:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
around the country a middle of the road
 
04:51:36.230 --> 04:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
moderate type of law was a 24-week ban
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
with felony penalties before 2019
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts had a 24-week ban with
 
04:51:44.550 --> 04:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
felony penalties it by the way had no
 
04:51:46.788 --> 04:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
fetal anomalies exception it had no rape
 
04:51:49.510 --> 04:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
exception because it was a 24-week or
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
six-month abortion ban
 
04:51:53.430 --> 04:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
likewise with new york likewise with
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
nevada all these states had 24-week
 
04:51:57.270 --> 04:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
felony bans
 
04:52:00.070 --> 04:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
similar in many ways to ours before 2019
 
04:52:03.430 --> 04:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
from 2019 to 2020 all of those states
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
effectively repealed those laws
 
04:52:07.270 --> 04:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
authorizing abortion up to birth for any
 
04:52:07.280 --> 04:52:08.230 align:start position:0%
authorizing abortion up to birth for any
reason

04:52:08.230 --> 04:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
reason
 
04:52:10.230 --> 04:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
the most recent state to do that was
 
04:52:13.190 --> 04:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts with its so-called roe act
 
04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
in december of 2020 which effectively
 
04:52:17.590 --> 04:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
authorized abortion up to birth we in
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire then went in the opposite
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
direction and went from allowing up
 
04:52:22.868 --> 04:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
abortion up to birth to having a
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
moderate 24 week abortion ban
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
representative did you have a follow-up
 
04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman does the act
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
contain an exception for fatal anomalies
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
our law does not contain an exception
 
04:52:38.788 --> 04:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
for fetal anomalies and it's a six-month
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
again abortion ban and i'd like to say a
 
04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
few things on the issue of fetal
 
04:52:42.480 --> 04:52:43.590 align:start position:0%
few things on the issue of fetal
anomalies

04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
anomalies
 
04:52:45.190 --> 04:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
one thing that i should say about fetal
 
04:52:47.590 --> 04:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
anomalies is i have not heard anyone on
 
04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
the other side in any of these hearings
 
04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
dispute that the vast majority of
 
04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
lethal fetal anomalies or fetal
 
04:52:56.230 --> 04:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
anomalies incompatible with life are
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
detected significantly in advance of the
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
six-month mark
 
04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
and so that leaves us with a handful of
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
exceptional cases on which we could make
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
law now the way to make law around those
 
04:53:10.470 --> 04:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
exceptional cases would be to instead of
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
passing a 6 month or 24 week ban to pass
 
04:53:16.230 --> 04:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
a viability ban which would by the way
 
04:53:19.030 --> 04:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
be more inclusive and would protect more
 
04:53:21.190 --> 04:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
unborn children than a 24-week ban
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
because you can be viable at 22 or even
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
21 weeks the reason that that wasn't
 
04:53:28.948 --> 04:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
done in this case is you can go back
 
04:53:32.470 --> 04:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
even to just 2018 in 2018 there was a
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill before this committee house bill
 
04:53:37.590 --> 04:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
1680 that attempted to ban abortion at
 
04:53:39.910 --> 04:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
viability doctors came before this
 
04:53:42.150 --> 04:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
committee and said it would be cruel to
 
04:53:44.150 --> 04:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
enact a subjective
 
04:53:46.788 --> 04:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
standard that varies from case to case
 
04:53:48.788 --> 04:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
and would sneak up on them and impose
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
penalties on them without giving them
 
04:53:53.350 --> 04:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
any clear standard the minority report
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
of this committee objected
 
04:53:57.830 --> 04:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
that viability is too subjective and
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
varies from case to case and that bill
 
04:54:02.230 --> 04:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
failed to provide a clear standard so a
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
clear standard is what we've done here
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
and and just quickly the only other
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
thing i'll add on this topic for now is
 
04:54:10.470 --> 04:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
that massachusetts again before december
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
of 2020 had a 24-week ban with no
 
04:54:16.708 --> 04:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
exception for lethal or severe fetal
 
04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
anomalies that did not deter physicians
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
from practicing in massachusetts which
 
04:54:22.948 --> 04:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
is often ranked as having the best
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
medical care in the country and that was
 
04:54:26.948 --> 04:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
in place for several years again just
 
04:54:30.550 --> 04:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
until december of 2020.
 
04:54:32.550 --> 04:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
and another follow-up representative
 
04:54:35.190 --> 04:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
otter yes and this will be the last one
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
first could you
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
send your testimony in email form to us
 
04:54:43.030 --> 04:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
to review later if you can and also
 
04:54:45.190 --> 04:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
does the act require
 
04:54:46.948 --> 04:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
the woman to carry
 
04:54:48.788 --> 04:54:48.798 align:start position:0%
a dead baby
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
well as to your first question what i
 
04:54:54.310 --> 04:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
have sent are copies of 399 and 1609 i
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
could also send to the committee
 
04:54:58.310 --> 04:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
material to the effect that i'm speaking
 
04:54:59.910 --> 04:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
on currently if that's what you would
 
04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
like but no the the second claim seems
 
04:55:04.788 --> 04:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
to have simply been invented out of
 
04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
nowhere in the last month or so
 
04:55:09.430 --> 04:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
in fact that scenario was explicitly
 
04:55:12.230 --> 04:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
provided for in the drafting of the bill
 
04:55:14.948 --> 04:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
the very definition of abortion
 
04:55:17.190 --> 04:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
specifically states that removing a
 
04:55:19.830 --> 04:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
child that has spontaneously died is not
 
04:55:22.070 --> 04:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
even an abortion so it doesn't come
 
04:55:25.430 --> 04:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
under the purview of this law
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
04:55:29.430 --> 04:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much mr chair thank
 
04:55:32.230 --> 04:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
you very much attorney hewitt um
 
04:55:34.310 --> 04:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
so you spoke of the
 
04:55:36.628 --> 04:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
law that was uh enacted
 
04:55:38.470 --> 04:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
during the budget trailer process a few
 
04:55:39.750 --> 04:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
months ago
 
04:55:39.760 --> 04:55:40.550 align:start position:0%
months ago
with

04:55:40.550 --> 04:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:55:42.310 --> 04:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
i don't recall much of a public hearing
 
04:55:42.320 --> 04:55:43.590 align:start position:0%
i don't recall much of a public hearing
processes

04:55:43.590 --> 04:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
processes
 
04:55:45.510 --> 04:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
our law are you saying that simply in
 
04:55:47.350 --> 04:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
the general sense that
 
04:55:48.788 --> 04:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
we're in new hampshire you're resident
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire you practice law in new
 
04:55:52.470 --> 04:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire or were you
 
04:55:55.430 --> 04:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
personally uh or otherwise involved with
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
actually crafting the language that is
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
ended up in the budget trailer lawn is
 
04:56:02.470 --> 04:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
now on the law books and we're now
 
04:56:03.830 --> 04:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
talking about deleting from the law
 
04:56:03.840 --> 04:56:05.110 align:start position:0%
talking about deleting from the law
books

04:56:05.110 --> 04:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
books
 
04:56:07.270 --> 04:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
i apologize representative horgan if i
 
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
did not say on behalf of cornerstone at
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
the beginning of my testimony i
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
certainly meant to i am speaking on
 
04:56:15.030 --> 04:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of cornerstone as a lobbyist with
 
04:56:16.788 --> 04:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
my orange name tag
 
04:56:19.110 --> 04:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
and not in my personal capacity and
 
04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
cornerstone did participate in the
 
04:56:23.590 --> 04:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
drafting of the bill which was drafted
 
04:56:25.830 --> 04:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire and not with any
 
04:56:28.628 --> 04:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
participation from any kind of outside
 
04:56:30.868 --> 04:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
national organizations i'm not sure if i
 
04:56:32.550 --> 04:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
can say the same for the millions of
 
04:56:34.470 --> 04:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
dollars that have been spent on ads to
 
04:56:36.150 --> 04:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
attempt to repeal this law i'm not sure
 
04:56:38.070 --> 04:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
where that money's come from but our
 
04:56:40.470 --> 04:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
activism was done here in this state
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
so you were one of the individuals at um
 
04:56:48.390 --> 04:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
04:56:50.310 --> 04:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
majority the senate finance committee at
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
least the majority there have consulted
 
04:56:52.948 --> 04:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
with while they're crafting this
 
04:56:52.958 --> 04:56:55.110 align:start position:0%
with while they're crafting this
language

04:56:55.110 --> 04:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
cornerstone i'm general counsel for
 
04:56:58.868 --> 04:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
cornerstone cornerstone participated in
 
04:57:01.110 --> 04:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
the drafting of this law the senate
 
04:57:02.470 --> 04:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
finance committee i think you mean the
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
senate judiciary committee
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
as as to whether this bill went through
 
04:57:09.350 --> 04:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
the full democratic process
 
04:57:12.070 --> 04:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
it was passed in hb2 but its predecessor
 
04:57:15.670 --> 04:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 1625 was virtually identical
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
it had a full hearing before
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
this committee uh at which i believe you
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
were present representative and that had
 
04:57:23.110 --> 04:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
a full hearing before the senate
 
04:57:25.510 --> 04:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee so to the best of my
 
04:57:27.270 --> 04:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
recollection all the language that is
 
04:57:28.708 --> 04:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
now in our current law went through the
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
entire normal democratic process and had
 
04:57:35.190 --> 04:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
a full here okay thanks other questions
 
04:57:38.788 --> 04:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:57:43.430 --> 04:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
04:57:45.430 --> 04:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
i would just like to know a little bit
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
more about your background
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
you said that you write policy for
 
04:57:53.750 --> 04:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
cornerstone but do you have any
 
04:57:55.270 --> 04:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
in addition do you have any medical
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
expertise on reproductive health
 
04:58:01.990 --> 04:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
i have no medical degree i'm a lawyer
 
04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
and familiar with the case law around
 
04:58:04.400 --> 04:58:05.510 align:start position:0%
and familiar with the case law around
abortion

04:58:05.510 --> 04:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
04:58:08.550 --> 04:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh as familiar as any of the lawyers
 
04:58:10.150 --> 04:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
that you're going to here testify on the
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
other side and i'd be happy to speak to
 
04:58:14.070 --> 04:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
any legal questions around the law
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
governing abortion because abortion is a
 
04:58:18.868 --> 04:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
recognized constitutional right under
 
04:58:20.708 --> 04:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
our federal law
 
04:58:23.350 --> 04:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
judges and lawyers from both sides must
 
04:58:26.470 --> 04:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
weigh in on abortion it is a legal issue
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
and so i'm addressing the law not with
 
04:58:30.868 --> 04:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
any medical expertise but in my capacity
 
04:58:32.230 --> 04:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
as an attorney
 
04:58:36.310 --> 04:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:38.230 --> 04:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
sing then thank you attorney hewlett
 
04:58:52.628 --> 04:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:54.788 --> 04:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
mr chair is prime sponsor of course i
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
will not participate in this
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
debate nor did i ask a question of our
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
witness but i would ask the chair if
 
04:59:07.350 --> 04:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
he considers it appropriate
 
04:59:11.110 --> 04:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
when gratuitous statements without
 
04:59:11.120 --> 04:59:12.430 align:start position:0%
when gratuitous statements without
factual

04:59:12.430 --> 04:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
factual
 
04:59:12.440 --> 04:59:14.070 align:start position:0%
factual
substantiation

04:59:14.070 --> 04:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
substantiation
 
04:59:15.670 --> 04:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
are made
 
04:59:15.680 --> 04:59:17.510 align:start position:0%
are made
by

04:59:17.510 --> 04:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:59:20.070 --> 04:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
someone who appears before us and i
 
04:59:22.550 --> 04:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
believe that this witness did cross the
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
line on that and i'd like to draw your
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
attention to it thank you
 
04:59:27.560 --> 04:59:27.570 align:start position:0%

mr chair i i heard your um observation
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
about the mask i respect that
 
05:00:23.830 --> 05:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
i have a four-year-old at home who's not
 
05:00:26.150 --> 05:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for a vaccination so i'm super
 
05:00:28.230 --> 05:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh cautious and i just wanted to preface
 
05:00:30.550 --> 05:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
that if anyone has a problem hearing um
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'll have to happily try to articulate
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
not a problem
 
05:00:37.990 --> 05:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um as i said i'm the
 
05:00:39.510 --> 05:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
vice president for government relations
 
05:00:40.868 --> 05:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
at dartmouth hitchcock dartmouth
 
05:00:42.628 --> 05:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
hitchcock opposed the fetal health
 
05:00:44.310 --> 05:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
05:00:47.190 --> 05:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
last year for several reasons yes the
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
ultra mandatory ultrasound was one of
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
those reasons but it was not the sole
 
05:00:50.718 --> 05:00:51.750 align:start position:0%
those reasons but it was not the sole
reason

05:00:51.750 --> 05:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
reason
 
05:00:53.270 --> 05:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
we also opposed for the lack of
 
05:00:56.070 --> 05:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
exception for rape incest and fetal
 
05:00:59.670 --> 05:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
anomalies incompatible with life
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
we also opposed
 
05:01:03.510 --> 05:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
for the imposition of criminal penalties
 
05:01:05.590 --> 05:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
and potential civil liability on our
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
providers and the implications on
 
05:01:10.628 --> 05:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
recruiting providers as a result
 
05:01:13.750 --> 05:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we support this effort
 
05:01:16.390 --> 05:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
i would however like to focus my
 
05:01:18.788 --> 05:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
comments on the latter two concerns
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
specifically what the failure to include
 
05:01:23.030 --> 05:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
an exception for fetal anomalies
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life means
 
05:01:27.190 --> 05:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
to the woman who discovers she has a
 
05:01:31.030 --> 05:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
non-viable fetus at or after 24 weeks
 
05:01:32.948 --> 05:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
i think the doctor who testified before
 
05:01:35.430 --> 05:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
me did a marvelous job of
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
explaining that situation
 
05:01:39.270 --> 05:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
but these are the results for that
 
05:01:39.280 --> 05:01:40.628 align:start position:0%
but these are the results for that
situation

05:01:40.628 --> 05:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:01:43.590 --> 05:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
that woman has to seek care out of state
 
05:01:45.510 --> 05:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
she has to carry a non-viable fetus to
 
05:01:45.520 --> 05:01:47.110 align:start position:0%
she has to carry a non-viable fetus to
delivery

05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
05:01:48.788 --> 05:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
or she has to convince a provider to
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
in my previous experience i was told
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
never to question the intentions behind
 
05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
or the motivations behind but i can't
 
05:01:59.910 --> 05:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
imagine that was the intent of the
 
05:02:03.910 --> 05:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to the last point the
 
05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
implication of criminal penalties on
 
05:02:09.510 --> 05:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
provider recruitment i'm genuinely sorry
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
that my colleague the chair of our ob
 
05:02:14.470 --> 05:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
gyn department dr alana cass is not here
 
05:02:16.390 --> 05:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
because she would be much more eloquent
 
05:02:18.390 --> 05:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
to speak to that issue as she is the
 
05:02:20.310 --> 05:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
person who's responsible for recruiting
 
05:02:22.470 --> 05:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
providers to dartmouth-hitchcock to
 
05:02:22.480 --> 05:02:23.270 align:start position:0%
providers to dartmouth-hitchcock to
serve

05:02:23.270 --> 05:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
serve
 
05:02:25.830 --> 05:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
a wide swath of the state of new
 
05:02:28.310 --> 05:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
maternal health care needs
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
i do however have a statement that i'm
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
happy to submit
 
05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
and if allowed read but one or two
 
05:02:34.240 --> 05:02:37.830 align:start position:0%
and if allowed read but one or two
sentences

05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
from dr cass i write today as the voice
 
05:02:42.150 --> 05:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
for women of new hampshire and their
 
05:02:44.948 --> 05:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
obstetrics care providers
 
05:02:46.628 --> 05:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
the fetal health protection act passed
 
05:02:49.030 --> 05:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
last year imperils the lives and equal
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
access to excellent health care that the
 
05:02:52.390 --> 05:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
women and families of new hampshire
 
05:02:52.400 --> 05:02:53.990 align:start position:0%
women and families of new hampshire
deserve

05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
deserve
 
05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
as of january 1st 2022
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
many of these women will be turned away
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
from the care that they're that we are
 
05:03:01.510 --> 05:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
fully capable of providing here in new
 
05:03:01.520 --> 05:03:02.390 align:start position:0%
fully capable of providing here in new
hampshire

05:03:02.390 --> 05:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
they will be forced to travel great
 
05:03:06.230 --> 05:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
distances away from the support of their
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
communities and families incur
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
additional expense 15 seconds thereby
 
05:03:12.788 --> 05:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
compounding the inequity of care for our
 
05:03:15.430 --> 05:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
most marginalized women
 
05:03:17.830 --> 05:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
left unchanged i believe the fetal
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
health protection act will steadily
 
05:03:20.788 --> 05:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
erode access to high quality health
 
05:03:22.948 --> 05:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
healthcare for the women and families of
 
05:03:24.070 --> 05:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:03:26.310 --> 05:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
by deterring the brightest obstetrician
 
05:03:28.150 --> 05:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
and neonatal providers
 
05:03:29.670 --> 05:03:29.680 align:start position:0%

05:04:13.670 --> 05:04:13.680 align:start position:0%

05:04:16.868 --> 05:04:16.878 align:start position:0%

good afternoon thank you for hearing my
 
05:04:21.430 --> 05:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
testimony i am here today to ask you to
 
05:04:25.590 --> 05:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
please vote against house bill 1673 fn
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine petternell i have
 
05:04:29.350 --> 05:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
lived in wolfeboro with my husband a
 
05:04:31.990 --> 05:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
practicing physician for 26 years we
 
05:04:33.430 --> 05:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
have four daughters and i hold a
 
05:04:35.590 --> 05:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
bachelor of science in nursing
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
it seems since birth my life has been
 
05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
entwined with the issue of life my own
 
05:04:41.830 --> 05:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
birth dealing with an unplanned
 
05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and facing a serious medical
 
05:04:46.628 --> 05:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
emergency while pregnant
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
when i was born in 1968
 
05:04:51.430 --> 05:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
five years before roe v wade it was
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
against the wishes of my maternal
 
05:04:53.280 --> 05:04:54.628 align:start position:0%
against the wishes of my maternal
grandmother

05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
grandmother
 
05:04:56.230 --> 05:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
she pressured my mother to get an
 
05:04:56.240 --> 05:04:57.510 align:start position:0%
she pressured my mother to get an
abortion

05:04:57.510 --> 05:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
fortunately my mother refused and
 
05:05:01.910 --> 05:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
instead released me for adoption
 
05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
i truly believe that if i had been
 
05:05:05.910 --> 05:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
conceived five years later my mother
 
05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
would have found it more difficult to
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
justify bringing me to term
 
05:05:12.310 --> 05:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
when i was 21 and single i faced my own
 
05:05:15.110 --> 05:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
unplanned pregnancy i ignored it for as
 
05:05:16.550 --> 05:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
long as i could
 
05:05:19.110 --> 05:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
until one day i felt the baby move
 
05:05:21.270 --> 05:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
fortunately i found a pregnancy center
 
05:05:23.270 --> 05:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
that supported me and referred me to a
 
05:05:25.350 --> 05:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
doctor who could help me deliver the
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
child and put her up for adoption there
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
are days that i regret not raising her
 
05:05:32.868 --> 05:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
but she is living a full life
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
now 32 she is a social worker and
 
05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
married with three children
 
05:05:39.750 --> 05:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
any inconvenience or embarrassment over
 
05:05:42.310 --> 05:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
that pregnancy seems so minor when i
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
look at all that she has brought to the
 
05:05:44.000 --> 05:05:45.590 align:start position:0%
look at all that she has brought to the
world

05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
world
 
05:05:47.350 --> 05:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
my husband and i have been through six
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancies together including four
 
05:05:53.030 --> 05:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
successful births and one miscarriage
 
05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
our sixth pregnancy put my life at
 
05:05:57.030 --> 05:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
significant risk
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
i developed a condition called placenta
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
procreta the placenta was growing
 
05:06:01.520 --> 05:06:02.708 align:start position:0%
procreta the placenta was growing
unchecked

05:06:02.708 --> 05:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
unchecked
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
growing through the uterine wall and
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
threatening my internal organs
 
05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
after much prayer i delivered my
 
05:06:11.350 --> 05:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
premature baby at 23 weeks through an
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
emergency c-section
 
05:06:16.470 --> 05:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
samuel was miraculously born alive
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
but only lived a short time
 
05:06:21.110 --> 05:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
in that time my beautiful son was
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
cherished lovingly held by family and
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
close friends as he peacefully passed
 
05:06:25.600 --> 05:06:27.750 align:start position:0%
close friends as he peacefully passed
away

05:06:27.750 --> 05:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
i cannot imagine choosing to abort him
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
and never having the chance to see and
 
05:06:34.390 --> 05:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
hold him
 
05:06:36.310 --> 05:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
so as you deliberate on repealing the
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
fetal life protection act and stripping
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
away any safeguards for preborn children
 
05:06:43.830 --> 05:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
think of individuals like me
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
and my daughter
 
05:06:46.868 --> 05:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
who were given the opportunity to be
 
05:06:49.350 --> 05:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
born and to live our lives
 
05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
think of babies like samuel who despite
 
05:06:53.910 --> 05:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
their short time with us were honored
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
and loved
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
please vote to reject house bill 1673 fn
 
05:07:05.110 --> 05:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:22.868 --> 05:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:24.708 --> 05:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the house
 
05:07:26.230 --> 05:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee my name is kayla
 
05:07:27.670 --> 05:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
montgomery i am the vice president of
 
05:07:28.948 --> 05:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
public affairs for planned parenthood
 
05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire action fund and planned
 
05:07:32.310 --> 05:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
parenthood of northern new england we
 
05:07:35.430 --> 05:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
support this bill house bill 1673 which
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
is a full repeal
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
of the recently enacted 24-week abortion
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
ban and ultrasound mandate because we
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
think it is cruel
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and we believe patients should
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
decide personal medical care with their
 
05:07:50.070 --> 05:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
health care providers not politicians
 
05:07:51.750 --> 05:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to touch on two points today
 
05:07:53.350 --> 05:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
although clearly there's a lot about
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
this bill to discuss
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
firstly this bill before you would
 
05:07:59.750 --> 05:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
repeal the unnecessary ultrasound
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
provision which as of january 1st in
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
this state is required for all patients
 
05:08:07.030 --> 05:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
who are seeking an abortion no matter
 
05:08:09.030 --> 05:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
what stage of pregnancy
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
i know that the house hhs committee and
 
05:08:13.990 --> 05:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
the senate have both passed identical
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
legislation to mitigate the harm of the
 
05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
ultrasound provision but i i think we
 
05:08:20.470 --> 05:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
can all agree the legislative process is
 
05:08:22.390 --> 05:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
complicated and this bill would address
 
05:08:24.708 --> 05:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound requirement
 
05:08:24.718 --> 05:08:25.670 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound requirement
secondly

05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
the lack of exceptions is cruel
 
05:08:30.390 --> 05:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the last few months you have
 
05:08:33.030 --> 05:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
heard from patients and providers
 
05:08:35.190 --> 05:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
who have experience in these complex
 
05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and who have shared their
 
05:08:37.040 --> 05:08:38.390 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and who have shared their
experiences

05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
05:08:41.030 --> 05:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
particularly surrounding fatal fetal
 
05:08:41.040 --> 05:08:42.550 align:start position:0%
particularly surrounding fatal fetal
anomalies

05:08:42.550 --> 05:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
anomalies
 
05:08:44.310 --> 05:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
you've heard about these much-wanted
 
05:08:46.708 --> 05:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
pregnancies where families have names
 
05:08:49.350 --> 05:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
picked out nurseries painted
 
05:08:52.070 --> 05:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
but who discover a fatal fetal anomaly a
 
05:08:55.110 --> 05:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
situation incompatible with life
 
05:08:58.150 --> 05:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
has occurred later in pregnancy an
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
example of this is anacephaly where a
 
05:09:03.350 --> 05:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
fetus develops without parts of the
 
05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
skull and the brain and there is no cure
 
05:09:10.230 --> 05:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
or no standard treatment for anticephaly
 
05:09:12.070 --> 05:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
now luckily these situations don't
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
happen very often
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
but they could happen to anyone
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
these granite staters are faced with
 
05:09:22.390 --> 05:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly complex decisions to make
 
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
they must have these conversations with
 
05:09:26.628 --> 05:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
their trusted providers and not be bound
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
by politicians arbitrary laws there is
 
05:09:31.670 --> 05:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
no playbook when it comes to pregnancy
 
05:09:33.990 --> 05:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
or pregnancy loss
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
families involved in these unique
 
05:09:37.430 --> 05:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
situations they deserve our compassion
 
05:09:39.030 --> 05:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
and our support
 
05:09:41.110 --> 05:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
not judgment and not government
 
05:09:41.120 --> 05:09:42.868 align:start position:0%
not judgment and not government
interference

05:09:42.868 --> 05:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
interference
 
05:09:44.550 --> 05:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
we have some of the best doctors in the
 
05:09:46.550 --> 05:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
world right here in new hampshire who
 
05:09:49.030 --> 05:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
are trained and experienced to take care
 
05:09:51.430 --> 05:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
of their patients in these cases yet the
 
05:09:53.190 --> 05:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is now sending
 
05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
people out of state if they can afford
 
05:09:55.360 --> 05:09:56.310 align:start position:0%
people out of state if they can afford
it

05:09:56.310 --> 05:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
everyone deserves care at their local
 
05:10:01.590 --> 05:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
hospital with their local doctor
 
05:10:03.750 --> 05:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
so planned parenthood believes this law
 
05:10:06.470 --> 05:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
should be repealed completely
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
which can be done by supporting this
 
05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
bill but
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
we of course are open to discussions on
 
05:10:13.350 --> 05:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
how to mitigate the harm of this by
 
05:10:14.868 --> 05:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
adding exceptions and removing the
 
05:10:16.628 --> 05:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
ultrasound mandate
 
05:10:19.830 --> 05:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
15 seconds all set thank you
 
05:10:21.350 --> 05:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from ms
 
05:10:21.360 --> 05:10:22.788 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from ms
montgomery

05:10:22.788 --> 05:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
montgomery
 
05:10:24.390 --> 05:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative notter
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:10:27.670 --> 05:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
taking the question how many late term
 
05:10:29.190 --> 05:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
abortions were there performed in new
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire each year before the ban
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:10:34.708 --> 05:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
at planned parenthood we do not provide
 
05:10:36.708 --> 05:10:36.718 align:start position:0%
abortion care after about
 
05:10:39.030 --> 05:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
16 weeks in new hampshire so i don't
 
05:10:41.190 --> 05:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
have that information for you but
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
i know there are representatives from
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
dartmouth-hitchcock who already spoke
 
05:10:45.910 --> 05:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
and could probably answer that question
 
05:10:48.310 --> 05:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
other questions yes
 
05:10:52.390 --> 05:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
the criminal penalty section of the law
 
05:10:53.590 --> 05:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
says that
 
05:10:53.600 --> 05:10:54.470 align:start position:0%
says that
only

05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:10:56.470 --> 05:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
this law only punishes providers for a
 
05:10:58.390 --> 05:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
violation if the provider is conscious
 
05:10:59.190 --> 05:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
of a
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
substantial risk
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
that a fetus is 24 weeks old if the
 
05:11:05.190 --> 05:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
provider skips an ultrasound when the
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
fetus is for example seven weeks old
 
05:11:09.350 --> 05:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
what criminal penalties do you think he
 
05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
would face under this law and why
 
05:11:14.150 --> 05:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
so if i understand your question about
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound provision i think as
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
has been established the intent of the
 
05:11:22.230 --> 05:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
ultrasound provision was
 
05:11:24.310 --> 05:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
around the 24 weeks which is what the
 
05:11:26.230 --> 05:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
representative from cornerstone and
 
05:11:26.240 --> 05:11:27.750 align:start position:0%
representative from cornerstone and
representative

05:11:27.750 --> 05:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:11:30.310 --> 05:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
said earlier
 
05:11:33.190 --> 05:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
but the implication that what is
 
05:11:34.948 --> 05:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
happening is that because of the way the
 
05:11:37.030 --> 05:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
law is written it requires it's required
 
05:11:38.310 --> 05:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
for all
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
abortion care at any stage of pregnancy
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
and at planned parenthood of northern
 
05:11:44.310 --> 05:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
england we certainly follow the law
 
05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
even if that law does not reflect
 
05:11:49.910 --> 05:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
best medical practices so even if there
 
05:11:51.670 --> 05:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
is no criminal penalty on it we have
 
05:11:53.510 --> 05:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
still course have to follow the law so
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
right now at planned parenthood and
 
05:11:58.470 --> 05:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh and other providers of abortion care
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
we are making sure that every
 
05:12:03.910 --> 05:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
every abortion has a ultrasound done
 
05:12:06.390 --> 05:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
prior and you asked a question earlier
 
05:12:08.310 --> 05:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
of someone about where in the law does
 
05:12:09.430 --> 05:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
it say
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
that this has to be transvaginal it does
 
05:12:13.830 --> 05:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
not say that in the law to be perfectly
 
05:12:16.550 --> 05:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
clear but at planned parenthood for
 
05:12:18.868 --> 05:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
first trimester abortions we it is an
 
05:12:21.270 --> 05:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
internal ultrasound which was explained
 
05:12:22.628 --> 05:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
already about some of the reasons as to
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
why it has to be transvaginal
 
05:12:28.070 --> 05:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representative
 
05:12:30.708 --> 05:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
otter yes i'm just curious
 
05:12:33.110 --> 05:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
would you do an abortion with without
 
05:12:36.550 --> 05:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
ultrasound because um isn't there um the
 
05:12:39.350 --> 05:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
risk of perforating a uterus without
 
05:12:41.190 --> 05:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
without seeing what you're doing so
 
05:12:43.430 --> 05:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and there are
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
providers who continue to provide
 
05:12:48.550 --> 05:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
to perform ultrasounds
 
05:12:50.390 --> 05:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
for every abortion
 
05:12:51.750 --> 05:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
prior to every abortion but we're
 
05:12:53.830 --> 05:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
finding and this is
 
05:12:56.390 --> 05:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
consistent with best medical practices
 
05:12:56.400 --> 05:12:57.510 align:start position:0%
consistent with best medical practices
updated

05:12:57.510 --> 05:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
updated
 
05:12:59.190 --> 05:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines when it comes to medication
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
that sometimes people just don't need an
 
05:13:03.830 --> 05:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
ultrasound prior a really good example
 
05:13:05.350 --> 05:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
is if someone comes in early in
 
05:13:05.360 --> 05:13:06.788 align:start position:0%
is if someone comes in early in
pregnancy

05:13:06.788 --> 05:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
and they're looking for a medication
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
abortion which is a safe effective way
 
05:13:12.310 --> 05:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
to terminate a pregnancy up to 11 weeks
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
if they know the date of their last
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
of their last menstruation they know
 
05:13:18.788 --> 05:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
exactly how far along they are if they
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
don't have any risk factors
 
05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
often an ultrasound just isn't necessary
 
05:13:24.390 --> 05:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
they can come in they can talk to their
 
05:13:26.310 --> 05:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
provider they can take their abortion
 
05:13:27.750 --> 05:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
pills and they can go home and have
 
05:13:30.310 --> 05:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
their abortion at home
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
so yes sometimes an ultrasound is
 
05:13:36.550 --> 05:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
necessary but not every time
 
05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:44.948 --> 05:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
05:13:49.270 --> 05:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
the next person will be laurie safford
 
05:13:51.590 --> 05:13:51.600 align:start position:0%

05:13:51.600 --> 05:13:53.510 align:start position:0%
and then following lori would be frank

05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you chairman and
 
05:14:04.868 --> 05:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
i'm lori safford from pelham
 
05:14:10.070 --> 05:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
and my son ben and i are here to testify
 
05:14:13.590 --> 05:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
against house bill 1673.
 
05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act is a
 
05:14:18.310 --> 05:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
moderate common sense law
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
that should stand as it is
 
05:14:22.868 --> 05:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
like me most granite staters believe in
 
05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
these protections for the preborn after
 
05:14:27.510 --> 05:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
24 weeks
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'm also a widow and the mom of two
 
05:14:33.430 --> 05:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
adult sons with a fatal illness called
 
05:14:36.310 --> 05:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
duchenne muscular dystrophy
 
05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
when they were young i was told by our
 
05:14:41.830 --> 05:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
neurologist at children's hospital in
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
boston that they would not survive their
 
05:14:46.708 --> 05:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
teens that i should take them home and
 
05:14:48.788 --> 05:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
love them
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
well sam turned 24 last month
 
05:14:54.868 --> 05:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
and ben will be 26 in may
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
although sam couldn't be here today i
 
05:14:59.510 --> 05:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
speak for them both
 
05:15:01.910 --> 05:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
when i say that although they have a
 
05:15:06.070 --> 05:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
fatal genetic fetal anomaly
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
due to a genetic defect at birth
 
05:15:11.190 --> 05:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
they are living productive
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
meaningful lives
 
05:15:14.948 --> 05:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
not that it has been easy
 
05:15:17.670 --> 05:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
they lost their father 10 years ago
 
05:15:20.150 --> 05:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
but ben has a social work degree
 
05:15:22.788 --> 05:15:22.798 align:start position:0%
and he works for a non-profit helping
 
05:15:25.670 --> 05:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
other young adults with disabilities
 
05:15:27.750 --> 05:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
sam is a musician
 
05:15:31.110 --> 05:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
a songwriter and a motivational speaker
 
05:15:33.510 --> 05:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
my friend rosalie stafford also wanted
 
05:15:36.390 --> 05:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
me to share her story with you today
 
05:15:38.868 --> 05:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
after an amniocentesis
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
when she was seven months pregnant she
 
05:15:43.670 --> 05:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
was told that her baby would not survive
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
birth due to a diagnosis as
 
05:15:46.000 --> 05:15:48.390 align:start position:0%
birth due to a diagnosis as
hydrocephalus

05:15:48.390 --> 05:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
hydrocephalus
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
well crystal
 
05:15:52.390 --> 05:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
kristen even though she had a fatal
 
05:15:54.150 --> 05:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly
 
05:15:57.590 --> 05:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
is alive and well at age 21.
 
05:16:00.310 --> 05:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
had rosalie listened to her doctor she
 
05:16:03.510 --> 05:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
would have killed her beautiful daughter
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
doctors are often wrong
 
05:16:08.550 --> 05:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
we are asking you to vote against house
 
05:16:11.030 --> 05:16:11.040 align:start position:0%

05:16:13.350 --> 05:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
and to give people like ben
 
05:16:15.270 --> 05:16:15.280 align:start position:0%

ben and i would be happy to take your
questions

05:16:23.510 --> 05:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:16:28.390 --> 05:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you for coming today
 
05:16:33.350 --> 05:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
as i said the next person will be frank
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
nack and that he would be followed by
 
05:16:57.030 --> 05:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:58.550 --> 05:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee
 
05:17:00.150 --> 05:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
05:17:01.590 --> 05:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
today my name is frank knack i'm the
 
05:17:03.270 --> 05:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
policy director with the aclu of new
 
05:17:03.280 --> 05:17:04.390 align:start position:0%
policy director with the aclu of new
hampshire

05:17:04.390 --> 05:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:17:07.750 --> 05:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
um so we support uh strongly support hb
 
05:17:09.990 --> 05:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
1673 for the reasons that have been laid
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
out from our colleagues at planned
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
parenthood from the bill's sponsors
 
05:17:15.270 --> 05:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to focus on two aspects of
 
05:17:18.788 --> 05:17:18.798 align:start position:0%
why we think this bill is so important
 
05:17:21.110 --> 05:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
so what hasn't been discussed right now
 
05:17:22.310 --> 05:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
i want to dig in a little bit on the
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
civil and the criminal penalties in
 
05:17:26.310 --> 05:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
existing law and so looking at the civil
 
05:17:28.390 --> 05:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
penalties for example current law
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
deputizes people unconnected with an
 
05:17:33.670 --> 05:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
abortion to sue abortion providers the
 
05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
civil penalty section allows a spouse or
 
05:17:37.910 --> 05:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
a parent
 
05:17:40.390 --> 05:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
to sue the abortion provider if the
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
pregnant person had an abortion outside
 
05:17:45.270 --> 05:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the the parameters of the 24-week ban
 
05:17:46.948 --> 05:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
and again as we talked about yesterday
 
05:17:48.708 --> 05:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
during the fatherhood bill
 
05:17:51.190 --> 05:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
what this means in reality is that an
 
05:17:53.990 --> 05:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
abusive spouse or in a parent who's been
 
05:17:56.708 --> 05:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
completely estranged from their child
 
05:17:58.868 --> 05:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
has standing to sue
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
for that for the pregnant person's
 
05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
decision we think that that is deeply
 
05:18:04.550 --> 05:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
problematic and something that needs to
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
immediately be remedied in new hampshire
 
05:18:06.400 --> 05:18:07.590 align:start position:0%
immediately be remedied in new hampshire
law

05:18:07.590 --> 05:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:18:07.600 --> 05:18:08.868 align:start position:0%
law
second

05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:18:10.708 --> 05:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
again a lot of these bills have been you
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
know couched in this um uh the the
 
05:18:15.110 --> 05:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
abortion bans have been couched in the
 
05:18:16.788 --> 05:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
uh patient health
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
from the patient health perspective
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
again this legislation the existing
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
legislation on the books places both
 
05:18:25.350 --> 05:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
medical providers and patients at risk
 
05:18:26.310 --> 05:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
so as
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
as has been discussed there's very
 
05:18:30.868 --> 05:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
limited exceptions to the 24-week ban
 
05:18:33.750 --> 05:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
including simply medical emergencies and
 
05:18:35.670 --> 05:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
the definition for that is outlined in
 
05:18:35.680 --> 05:18:37.430 align:start position:0%
the definition for that is outlined in
hb2

05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
but because there is no clear universal
 
05:18:41.350 --> 05:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
definition at the point at which a
 
05:18:43.110 --> 05:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
pregnant person's life becomes
 
05:18:43.120 --> 05:18:44.390 align:start position:0%
pregnant person's life becomes
endangered

05:18:44.390 --> 05:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
endangered
 
05:18:46.390 --> 05:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
a physician may delay
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh treatment may delay an abortion
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
because of fear of both civil and
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties if they move forward
 
05:18:54.470 --> 05:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
so we think again that is another reason
 
05:18:56.230 --> 05:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
why this bill is important and needs to
 
05:18:57.670 --> 05:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
go through thank you for the opportunity
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
to testify and i'd be happy to answer
 
05:19:00.470 --> 05:19:00.480 align:start position:0%

seeing them thank you for your testimony
 
05:19:09.830 --> 05:19:09.840 align:start position:0%

05:19:31.990 --> 05:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'm also a resident of empires new
 
05:19:35.830 --> 05:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i have a phd in
 
05:19:38.948 --> 05:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
computational sciences and statistics
 
05:19:40.868 --> 05:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire right to life opposes hp
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
1673 for several reasons
 
05:19:44.550 --> 05:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
the first thing i would like to ask
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
though is that everybody listening
 
05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
consider two fundamental questions
 
05:19:50.310 --> 05:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
who is a person
 
05:19:53.190 --> 05:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
and what rights do people deserve
 
05:19:54.868 --> 05:19:54.878 align:start position:0%
some of the greatest depressions in
 
05:19:57.510 --> 05:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
human history are because we've gotten
 
05:19:59.110 --> 05:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
these questions wrong some of the
 
05:20:02.470 --> 05:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
greatest human rights violations
 
05:20:03.990 --> 05:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
if this bill was just about personal
 
05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
medical decisions i wouldn't be here
 
05:20:07.510 --> 05:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
testifying on this
 
05:20:09.030 --> 05:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
but medical science says that there's a
 
05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
second person
 
05:20:12.550 --> 05:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
and the flpa
 
05:20:15.270 --> 05:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
only protects babies that are at 24
 
05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
weeks generally considered when a baby
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
can survive outside the womb
 
05:20:22.390 --> 05:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would move new hampshire
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
backwards to have one of the most
 
05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
hostile abuse in the country
 
05:20:28.390 --> 05:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
against unborn children
 
05:20:29.830 --> 05:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
allowing them to be killed for any
 
05:20:32.150 --> 05:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
reason up to the hour before they're
 
05:20:34.548 --> 05:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
born for any reason
 
05:20:36.310 --> 05:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
the goodmacher institute a pro
 
05:20:38.070 --> 05:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
pro-choice organization that advocates
 
05:20:41.430 --> 05:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
for abortion says that 43 other states
 
05:20:43.030 --> 05:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
have some restrictions on late-term
 
05:20:43.040 --> 05:20:44.150 align:start position:0%
have some restrictions on late-term
abortion

05:20:44.150 --> 05:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
05:20:46.310 --> 05:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
a poll as recently as 2019 showed that
 
05:20:48.070 --> 05:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
about 80 percent of americans agreed
 
05:20:49.590 --> 05:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
that late-term abortions should not be
 
05:20:49.600 --> 05:20:51.030 align:start position:0%
that late-term abortions should not be
allowed

05:20:51.030 --> 05:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
05:20:54.390 --> 05:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
this the flpa reflects a broad consensus
 
05:20:56.788 --> 05:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
within new hampshire and across america
 
05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
about who who deserves protections
 
05:21:02.628 --> 05:21:02.638 align:start position:0%
and if the law is there to defend the
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
vulnerable from harm who is more
 
05:21:06.868 --> 05:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
vulnerable than someone
 
05:21:08.230 --> 05:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
who can't run
 
05:21:13.590 --> 05:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:15.670 --> 05:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
if we agree that an unborn child that 24
 
05:21:18.230 --> 05:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
weeks is a person then that the child
 
05:21:20.230 --> 05:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
deserves society's protections and we
 
05:21:21.670 --> 05:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
need to take their interests into
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:26.150 --> 05:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
this is not just about the rights of the
 
05:21:27.670 --> 05:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
pregnant mother
 
05:21:29.910 --> 05:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's another person there
 
05:21:31.110 --> 05:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
when you hear people raising the issue
 
05:21:32.788 --> 05:21:32.798 align:start position:0%
of criminal penalties keep please keep
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
this in mind
 
05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
would laws against assault be effective
 
05:21:37.990 --> 05:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
without a criminal penalty i don't think
 
05:21:42.390 --> 05:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:45.030 --> 05:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:47.430 --> 05:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
so i guess in terms of the safety i have
 
05:21:49.350 --> 05:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
one thing i haven't heard mentioned here
 
05:21:50.548 --> 05:21:50.558 align:start position:0%
is about the safety of late term
 
05:21:50.558 --> 05:21:52.390 align:start position:0%
is about the safety of late term
abortion

05:21:52.390 --> 05:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
05:21:53.750 --> 05:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
the mother's health is actually
 
05:21:55.670 --> 05:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
significantly at a significantly higher
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
risk with late term abortion versus
 
05:21:58.948 --> 05:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
giving birth naturally or through
 
05:21:58.958 --> 05:22:00.150 align:start position:0%
giving birth naturally or through
c-section

05:22:00.150 --> 05:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
c-section
 
05:22:01.510 --> 05:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to provide the references
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
on that if anybody's interested
 
05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
being significantly riskier for fatal
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
anomalies it would actually make more
 
05:22:10.628 --> 05:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
sense for the health of the mother to
 
05:22:10.638 --> 05:22:11.670 align:start position:0%
sense for the health of the mother to
deliver

05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
deliver
 
05:22:14.310 --> 05:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
than to actually 15 seconds to kill her
 
05:22:14.320 --> 05:22:15.990 align:start position:0%
than to actually 15 seconds to kill her
child

05:22:15.990 --> 05:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion i ask that you not turn
 
05:22:19.990 --> 05:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
back the clock by allowing a risky
 
05:22:22.230 --> 05:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
procedure and with that i would love to
 
05:22:23.590 --> 05:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
05:22:25.910 --> 05:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from mr hennessy
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative notter
 
05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just quickly do
 
05:22:31.590 --> 05:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
you have written testimony because i
 
05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
missed part of what you were saying and
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
it was something about the number of
 
05:22:35.040 --> 05:22:36.548 align:start position:0%
it was something about the number of
states

05:22:36.548 --> 05:22:36.558 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:22:40.628 --> 05:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
um i i'm happy to send some in
 
05:22:40.638 --> 05:22:41.830 align:start position:0%
um i i'm happy to send some in
okay

05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
other questions representative chase
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
my question i'm curious if you have any
 
05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
idea who um
 
05:22:54.390 --> 05:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
who's most at fault in late term
 
05:22:56.708 --> 05:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
abortion or late term pregnancies for
 
05:22:59.430 --> 05:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
abortions would it be the mother or the
 
05:22:59.440 --> 05:23:01.190 align:start position:0%
abortions would it be the mother or the
doctors

05:23:01.190 --> 05:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
05:23:01.990 --> 05:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:23:04.708 --> 05:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
representative i believe that the law
 
05:23:06.548 --> 05:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
criminalizes not the mother but the
 
05:23:06.558 --> 05:23:09.590 align:start position:0%
criminalizes not the mother but the
provider

05:23:09.590 --> 05:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:09.600 --> 05:23:10.830 align:start position:0%

xenon thank you mr hennessy for you
 
05:23:15.590 --> 05:23:15.600 align:start position:0%

and this will show be followed by
 
05:23:27.590 --> 05:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:28.628 --> 05:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
honorable chair and members of the
 
05:23:30.310 --> 05:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
committee my name is devin quinn i'm the
 
05:23:31.750 --> 05:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
director of policy for the new hampshire
 
05:23:35.110 --> 05:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
women's foundation we support hb 1673
 
05:23:37.590 --> 05:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
because the 24-week abortion ban and
 
05:23:40.628 --> 05:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
ultrasound mandate impose inequitable
 
05:23:42.390 --> 05:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
barriers to accessing abortion and
 
05:23:44.708 --> 05:23:44.718 align:start position:0%
create a culture of shame and stigma for
 
05:23:46.708 --> 05:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
those seeking reproductive care
 
05:23:48.948 --> 05:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
a 24-week abortion ban places a
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
particularly inequitable burden on some
 
05:23:52.390 --> 05:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
people who will be forced to seek
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
abortion in another state who may not
 
05:23:55.990 --> 05:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
have means to do so
 
05:23:57.670 --> 05:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
this would include low-income women
 
05:23:59.830 --> 05:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
women living in rural areas survivors of
 
05:24:01.990 --> 05:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and control who are
 
05:24:04.150 --> 05:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
limited in their movement and travel and
 
05:24:07.030 --> 05:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
those without access to transportation
 
05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
a 24-week abortion ban in new hampshire
 
05:24:10.868 --> 05:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
targets women who need local
 
05:24:12.868 --> 05:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
compassionate reliable and affordable
 
05:24:14.310 --> 05:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
care the most
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound mandate when applied to
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
people who would not medically need or
 
05:24:21.430 --> 05:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
personally want an ultrasound sometimes
 
05:24:23.670 --> 05:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
very early on in pregnancy contributes
 
05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
to a culture of shaming women this
 
05:24:27.990 --> 05:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
medically unnecessary requirement adds
 
05:24:29.510 --> 05:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
an additional barrier and is
 
05:24:31.590 --> 05:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
disempowering to women and individuals
 
05:24:33.670 --> 05:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
seeking reproductive health care
 
05:24:35.190 --> 05:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
we believe women and people who can
 
05:24:36.708 --> 05:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
become pregnant should have access to
 
05:24:38.230 --> 05:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
the full range of reproductive health
 
05:24:40.470 --> 05:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
care including abortion free from shame
 
05:24:42.390 --> 05:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
and stigma and we urge the committee to
 
05:24:44.788 --> 05:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
recommend 1673 ought to pass i have
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
additional written testimony for you
 
05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%

05:25:05.670 --> 05:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
and she'll be
 
05:25:10.390 --> 05:25:10.400 align:start position:0%

05:25:22.470 --> 05:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
off of a diagnosis that wasn't even
 
05:25:22.480 --> 05:25:23.590 align:start position:0%
off of a diagnosis that wasn't even
correct

05:25:23.590 --> 05:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:25:25.750 --> 05:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
makes it honestly surprising to me that
 
05:25:28.470 --> 05:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
i'm even standing here today
 
05:25:30.788 --> 05:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
especially considering the fact that so
 
05:25:34.708 --> 05:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
many others are not as lucky
 
05:25:36.868 --> 05:25:36.878 align:start position:0%
no medical test could say that i love
 
05:25:38.470 --> 05:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
reading and writing
 
05:25:41.670 --> 05:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
or show that i like doing puzzles
 
05:25:43.510 --> 05:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
no one could tell my family and my
 
05:25:46.310 --> 05:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
friends that i'm creative or that i like
 
05:25:46.320 --> 05:25:48.310 align:start position:0%
friends that i'm creative or that i like
agriculture

05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
05:25:52.868 --> 05:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
they could not say who i am as a person
 
05:25:54.868 --> 05:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
everything i ever have done and ever
 
05:25:57.750 --> 05:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
will do i got the opportunity to do
 
05:26:00.470 --> 05:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
because i was not aborted
 
05:26:02.868 --> 05:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
that is an opportunity that everyone
 
05:26:03.910 --> 05:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
should have
 
05:26:07.750 --> 05:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately not everyone does
 
05:26:09.910 --> 05:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act should
 
05:26:11.910 --> 05:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
remain in place
 
05:26:13.830 --> 05:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
it cannot determine the fate of a child
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
before 24 weeks gestation
 
05:26:18.788 --> 05:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
but it can protect those beyond six
 
05:26:21.110 --> 05:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
months of pregnancy after a child is
 
05:26:23.910 --> 05:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
able to feel pain
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:27.030 --> 05:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from this mark
 
05:26:27.040 --> 05:26:29.750 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from this mark

05:26:48.310 --> 05:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to my testimony
 
05:26:49.830 --> 05:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
i do want to let you know it's three
 
05:26:51.510 --> 05:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
minutes and 10 seconds and i will do my
 
05:26:52.868 --> 05:26:52.878 align:start position:0%
very best
 
05:26:57.430 --> 05:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
i am a mom of seven children including a
 
05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
daughter kayla ryan that i lost 16 years
 
05:27:04.390 --> 05:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
ago after having a medical termination
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire at 22 weeks
 
05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
when i became pregnant with kayla my
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
first child was two years old i could
 
05:27:12.548 --> 05:27:12.558 align:start position:0%
not have been more excited for her to be
 
05:27:14.948 --> 05:27:14.958 align:start position:0%
a big sister and our family to grow
 
05:27:16.628 --> 05:27:16.638 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any testing through our
 
05:27:18.390 --> 05:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
pregnancy other than our first routine
 
05:27:21.190 --> 05:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
ultrasound when i was 21 weeks along
 
05:27:22.868 --> 05:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
during the ultrasound i almost
 
05:27:25.110 --> 05:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
immediately knew something was wrong
 
05:27:27.270 --> 05:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
the tech turned continually went from
 
05:27:30.070 --> 05:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
kayla's heart to her head back and forth
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
i finally asked is something wrong
 
05:27:33.830 --> 05:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
our daughter
 
05:27:35.910 --> 05:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
our doctor told us she couldn't explain
 
05:27:37.510 --> 05:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
the findings but she needed to
 
05:27:39.510 --> 05:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
immediately send us to a specialist for
 
05:27:41.750 --> 05:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
further evaluation
 
05:27:43.430 --> 05:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
two days later we went for our
 
05:27:45.190 --> 05:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
appointment with dr kaufman at the
 
05:27:46.628 --> 05:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
elliott hospital
 
05:27:48.230 --> 05:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
upon performing a higher level
 
05:27:50.230 --> 05:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
ultrasound dr kaufman explained that our
 
05:27:51.910 --> 05:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
baby had only three chambers in her
 
05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
heart minimal brain tissue and she had
 
05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
severe hydrocephalus
 
05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
my heart was crushed
 
05:27:59.628 --> 05:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
he asked if we would like to do an
 
05:28:01.830 --> 05:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
amniocentesis and i thought immediately
 
05:28:03.590 --> 05:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want to lose my baby i can't
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
risk it i had been thinking for two days
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
no matter what was wrong we would go
 
05:28:09.510 --> 05:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
through it and we would do whatever we
 
05:28:11.430 --> 05:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
could for our child
 
05:28:12.788 --> 05:28:12.798 align:start position:0%
i asked him
 
05:28:15.270 --> 05:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
what our child's chances of survival was
 
05:28:17.350 --> 05:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
and he replied unfortunately your baby
 
05:28:19.270 --> 05:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
has no chance to survive outside of your
 
05:28:19.280 --> 05:28:20.470 align:start position:0%
has no chance to survive outside of your
womb

05:28:20.470 --> 05:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
womb
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
he explained she would need an immediate
 
05:28:24.868 --> 05:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
heart transplant and be because of her
 
05:28:26.708 --> 05:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
brain they would not be able to give her
 
05:28:28.390 --> 05:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
a new heart
 
05:28:30.230 --> 05:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
this was not just a disability or a
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
situation of around-the-clock care for
 
05:28:33.430 --> 05:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
our daughter she didn't have the
 
05:28:36.310 --> 05:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
slightest chance of living outside of me
 
05:28:38.150 --> 05:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
after our ultrasound we sat with dr
 
05:28:40.150 --> 05:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
kaufman in his office he explained that
 
05:28:41.670 --> 05:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
due to the measurements of kayla's head
 
05:28:43.350 --> 05:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
we needed to make an immediate decision
 
05:28:45.110 --> 05:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
she was measuring 22 weeks and the
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
current situation in new hampshire
 
05:28:49.030 --> 05:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
allowed no time to decide
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
the available providers for a late term
 
05:28:52.628 --> 05:28:52.638 align:start position:0%
abortion and their own regulations were
 
05:28:55.190 --> 05:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
the time limiting factor he advised us
 
05:28:57.030 --> 05:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
of our options including waiting for our
 
05:28:59.430 --> 05:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
baby to die in utero going through a dna
 
05:29:01.030 --> 05:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
or being induced to go through labor and
 
05:29:03.270 --> 05:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
delivery as a mother i knew there was no
 
05:29:05.270 --> 05:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
way i could continue to carry kayla
 
05:29:07.190 --> 05:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
knowing she was going to die inside of
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
me and knowing that my little girl would
 
05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
only grow closer to her soon-to-be
 
05:29:10.320 --> 05:29:11.430 align:start position:0%
only grow closer to her soon-to-be
sister

05:29:11.430 --> 05:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
sister
 
05:29:12.788 --> 05:29:12.798 align:start position:0%
going to work every day and having
 
05:29:14.948 --> 05:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
people congratulating me asking details
 
05:29:16.628 --> 05:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
about when my baby was due and what
 
05:29:18.628 --> 05:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
gender we were expecting all the while
 
05:29:20.230 --> 05:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
knowing we were just waiting for kayla
 
05:29:21.270 --> 05:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
to die
 
05:29:22.868 --> 05:29:22.878 align:start position:0%
we chose to have a medical termination
 
05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
by labor and delivery we were scheduled
 
05:29:26.230 --> 05:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
that friday for the cardiac injection
 
05:29:28.470 --> 05:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
and saturday i would be induced
 
05:29:30.150 --> 05:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
we met the physician that friday and she
 
05:29:31.990 --> 05:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
performed a third ultrasound to confirm
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
kayla's fatal anomaly she emphasized
 
05:29:35.830 --> 05:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
that she only performed terminations for
 
05:29:37.350 --> 05:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
fatal anomalies
 
05:29:39.510 --> 05:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
kayla was born still on december 10
 
05:29:41.750 --> 05:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
2005. i went through labor with no
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
medication i wanted to feel the pain i
 
05:29:45.030 --> 05:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
knew she would never have the chance to
 
05:29:45.040 --> 05:29:45.990 align:start position:0%
knew she would never have the chance to
feel

05:29:45.990 --> 05:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
feel
 
05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
we held her for several hours had her
 
05:29:48.240 --> 05:29:49.590 align:start position:0%
we held her for several hours had her
baptized

05:29:49.590 --> 05:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
baptized
 
05:29:51.750 --> 05:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
she was 12 inches long and weighed 14
 
05:29:51.760 --> 05:29:52.868 align:start position:0%
she was 12 inches long and weighed 14
ounces

05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
ounces
 
05:29:54.548 --> 05:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
her fingers and toes were perfect and
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
her little feet and hands were imprinted
 
05:29:58.390 --> 05:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
and hang on my wall today it was the
 
05:29:59.830 --> 05:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
hardest day of my life leaving her
 
05:30:01.510 --> 05:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
behind when i left the hospital the next
 
05:30:01.520 --> 05:30:02.390 align:start position:0%
behind when i left the hospital the next
day

05:30:02.390 --> 05:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:30:04.390 --> 05:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
a month afterwards we found out kayla
 
05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
had a large deletion in her 15th
 
05:30:06.240 --> 05:30:07.430 align:start position:0%
had a large deletion in her 15th
chromosome

05:30:07.430 --> 05:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
chromosome
 
05:30:09.110 --> 05:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
if we had waited for those results to
 
05:30:10.470 --> 05:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
determine our decision it would have
 
05:30:12.868 --> 05:30:12.878 align:start position:0%
been beyond the 24 weeks
 
05:30:14.708 --> 05:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
when you think of why this exception is
 
05:30:16.708 --> 05:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
important to this bill i hope you think
 
05:30:17.830 --> 05:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
of kayla
 
05:30:19.510 --> 05:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
i hope you too believe that she has a
 
05:30:21.990 --> 05:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
purpose in all of our lives i hope you
 
05:30:23.510 --> 05:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
see that allowing a loving mother to
 
05:30:25.430 --> 05:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
make a decision to let her child go from
 
05:30:27.270 --> 05:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
a body that will not sustain her outside
 
05:30:29.190 --> 05:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
of her mother's womb is the right thing
 
05:30:30.150 --> 05:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
i hope you see it as a decision made
 
05:30:34.150 --> 05:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
from true love nothing more and nothing
 
05:30:34.160 --> 05:30:35.670 align:start position:0%
from true love nothing more and nothing
less

05:30:35.670 --> 05:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
less

05:30:59.110 --> 05:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
my name is sarah marcu i am from
 
05:31:01.590 --> 05:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
northfield and i oppose this bill
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
when i was 24 weeks pregnant with my
 
05:31:05.670 --> 05:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
daughter i was sent for genetic testing
 
05:31:08.070 --> 05:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
due to abnormalities in an ultrasound
 
05:31:09.030 --> 05:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
they determined that she had
 
05:31:11.350 --> 05:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
microcephaly a hole in her heart a slew
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
of genetic disorders and that if she
 
05:31:15.670 --> 05:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
managed to survive being born at all
 
05:31:17.670 --> 05:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
that she would never walk or talk
 
05:31:19.270 --> 05:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
we were told that the only humane thing
 
05:31:21.910 --> 05:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
to do would be to abort her humane as if
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
she were an animal and i declined
 
05:31:26.390 --> 05:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
immediately another physician rushed
 
05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
into the room and said i cannot express
 
05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
to you how dire this situation is you
 
05:31:34.548 --> 05:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
need to take care of this as she put it
 
05:31:36.548 --> 05:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
because after 25 weeks we would be
 
05:31:39.110 --> 05:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
required to resuscitate her if she were
 
05:31:42.708 --> 05:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:45.430 --> 05:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
it would be too late to make a decision
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
and again i declined
 
05:31:49.830 --> 05:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
it was never a choice for me because i'm
 
05:31:52.390 --> 05:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
a firm believer in the sanctity of life
 
05:31:54.070 --> 05:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
but i've often wondered about those who
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
waver those who don't have a moral
 
05:31:57.750 --> 05:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
compass or those who are just too plain
 
05:31:59.670 --> 05:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
scared or confused
 
05:32:01.910 --> 05:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
these questions don't stem from any
 
05:32:04.310 --> 05:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
judgment whatsoever but rather from a
 
05:32:06.070 --> 05:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
heart of complete understanding as one
 
05:32:07.350 --> 05:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
who's been there and who's walked that
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
road before because you see
 
05:32:11.110 --> 05:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
i was also
 
05:32:12.948 --> 05:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
i also know what it's like to be a
 
05:32:14.310 --> 05:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
teenager and find out that there's a
 
05:32:15.830 --> 05:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
baby on the way
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
had i given into the pressure because of
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
my age i would have robbed this world of
 
05:32:21.990 --> 05:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
an amazing young man who is the first to
 
05:32:23.990 --> 05:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer he's kind and compassionate
 
05:32:25.670 --> 05:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
and who by the way will graduate from
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
unh this coming may with his third
 
05:32:31.830 --> 05:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
college degree at the age of 21.
 
05:32:34.150 --> 05:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
later if i'd given in to the pressure of
 
05:32:35.670 --> 05:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
those in the medical field who were so
 
05:32:37.030 --> 05:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
insistent that they were right and that
 
05:32:39.190 --> 05:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
they could not under any circumstance be
 
05:32:39.200 --> 05:32:39.990 align:start position:0%
they could not under any circumstance be
wrong

05:32:39.990 --> 05:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
05:32:41.430 --> 05:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
this world would miss an incredible
 
05:32:43.350 --> 05:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
young woman who is equally as gifted in
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
whom you heard from a few minutes ago
 
05:32:47.830 --> 05:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
if you take the time to listen there is
 
05:32:50.470 --> 05:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
a moral outcry from the people
 
05:32:52.470 --> 05:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
from your constituents and it is being
 
05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
drowned out by corporations with an
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
agenda and seemingly endless money to
 
05:32:58.548 --> 05:32:58.558 align:start position:0%
throw at their cause they are losing
 
05:33:00.548 --> 05:33:00.558 align:start position:0%
ground across the country
 
05:33:02.548 --> 05:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
as legislators governors and judges
 
05:33:04.628 --> 05:33:04.638 align:start position:0%
uphold the will of the people and they
 
05:33:05.590 --> 05:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
have turned their sights on new
 
05:33:07.110 --> 05:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire because they think that we're
 
05:33:08.628 --> 05:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
a small state and that we're not paying
 
05:33:08.638 --> 05:33:09.750 align:start position:0%
a small state and that we're not paying
attention

05:33:09.750 --> 05:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
attention
 
05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
25 states are further along
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
in this aspect than new hampshire
 
05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
currently is
 
05:33:17.430 --> 05:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
without even bringing into this
 
05:33:19.190 --> 05:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
discussion the lack of constitutional
 
05:33:21.190 --> 05:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
merit the massive human rights issue the
 
05:33:22.868 --> 05:33:22.878 align:start position:0%
emotional trauma that post-abortive
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
family members live with are the
 
05:33:26.708 --> 05:33:26.718 align:start position:0%
physical trauma and increased cancer
 
05:33:28.788 --> 05:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
rates that post-abortive mothers face
 
05:33:30.708 --> 05:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
it's time to take every possible step
 
05:33:32.470 --> 05:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
toward halting abortion simply because
 
05:33:34.150 --> 05:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do
 
05:33:35.830 --> 05:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
i could stand here and bring study after
 
05:33:37.590 --> 05:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
study as to the physical and emotional
 
05:33:39.190 --> 05:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
effects that post-abortive mothers and
 
05:33:40.868 --> 05:33:40.878 align:start position:0%
fathers live with but the strongest
 
05:33:42.708 --> 05:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
testimony that i have is the willingness
 
05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
to give my children life even in the
 
05:33:45.670 --> 05:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
face of knowing that it would be
 
05:33:47.830 --> 05:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
difficult and possibly even
 
05:33:49.510 --> 05:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
not possible if they were to survive
 
05:33:51.270 --> 05:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
with these abnormalities
 
05:33:54.310 --> 05:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
at 24 weeks i was 15 seconds i was 20
 
05:33:56.548 --> 05:33:56.558 align:start position:0%
told to abort my daughter
 
05:33:58.390 --> 05:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
and because at 25 weeks doctors would
 
05:34:00.390 --> 05:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
resuscitate her let that sink in for a
 
05:34:01.990 --> 05:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
minute the repeal of the fetal life
 
05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
protection act advocates for the murder
 
05:34:05.830 --> 05:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
and dismembering of a child at a point
 
05:34:07.270 --> 05:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
when the greater medical community
 
05:34:08.470 --> 05:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
already admits that this child is
 
05:34:10.150 --> 05:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
developed enough to live independently
 
05:34:12.390 --> 05:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
from his mother okay ms marcou could you
 
05:34:13.990 --> 05:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
just finish yes
 
05:34:15.430 --> 05:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's time to stop encouraging the
 
05:34:16.788 --> 05:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
slaughter of innocent people on the
 
05:34:19.030 --> 05:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
altar of convenience and it's time to
 
05:34:20.548 --> 05:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
stop allowing doctors to push their
 
05:34:20.558 --> 05:34:21.670 align:start position:0%
stop allowing doctors to push their
agenda

05:34:21.670 --> 05:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
05:34:23.110 --> 05:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act should
 
05:34:25.350 --> 05:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
stand thank you thank you other
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
questions from ms marco

thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:34:33.830 --> 05:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
question i heard you in your fast speak
 
05:34:36.470 --> 05:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
say that a woman who's had an abortion
 
05:34:39.030 --> 05:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
has a higher risk of cancer where where
 
05:34:41.190 --> 05:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
do you have that information from so
 
05:34:42.548 --> 05:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
that's actually a
 
05:34:46.470 --> 05:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
matter of medical record and i believe
 
05:34:46.480 --> 05:34:47.830 align:start position:0%
matter of medical record and i believe
um

05:34:47.830 --> 05:34:47.840 align:start position:0%

maris holland i'm a resident physician
 
05:35:59.590 --> 05:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
in obstetrics and gynecology i'm here on
 
05:36:01.670 --> 05:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself i'm a resident here of
 
05:36:02.948 --> 05:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i'm completing my
 
05:36:06.788 --> 05:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
your current legislation
 
05:36:11.350 --> 05:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
banning abortion later in pregnancy and
 
05:36:14.628 --> 05:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
mandating ultrasounds i believe sends a
 
05:36:16.548 --> 05:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
message of mistrust
 
05:36:19.030 --> 05:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
and derision to doctors who are already
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid in short supply and quite
 
05:36:23.590 --> 05:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
burnt out
 
05:36:25.750 --> 05:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
by threatening doctors with a felony for
 
05:36:27.510 --> 05:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
providing the most up-to-date
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
compassionate and evidence-based medical
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
options to patients you invalidate our
 
05:36:35.430 --> 05:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
training and our expertise
 
05:36:38.150 --> 05:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is such an emotional topic
 
05:36:39.910 --> 05:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's poignantly
 
05:36:41.910 --> 05:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
illustrated by the different personal
 
05:36:44.390 --> 05:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
stories that we've heard today from
 
05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
those testifying
 
05:36:48.948 --> 05:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
i'm so glad to have heard them and i
 
05:36:52.230 --> 05:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
can't help reflecting the very fact that
 
05:36:54.310 --> 05:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
individuals here that all of you are
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
hearing about their personal medical
 
05:36:57.270 --> 05:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
stories from
 
05:36:59.750 --> 05:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
having children with duchenne's muscular
 
05:37:03.270 --> 05:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
dystrophy from having placenta procreda
 
05:37:05.910 --> 05:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
each can have very different
 
05:37:09.270 --> 05:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
opinions preferences and desires when
 
05:37:11.590 --> 05:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
faced with these extremely challenging
 
05:37:11.600 --> 05:37:13.190 align:start position:0%
faced with these extremely challenging
diagnoses

05:37:13.190 --> 05:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
diagnoses
 
05:37:15.750 --> 05:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
it really to me emphasizes the need to
 
05:37:19.190 --> 05:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
have an array of medically safe options
 
05:37:22.230 --> 05:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
to tailor to individual situations
 
05:37:25.670 --> 05:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
there is no one right answer to this
 
05:37:27.910 --> 05:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
many women do not want to have abortions
 
05:37:30.310 --> 05:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
and they do not need to
 
05:37:31.510 --> 05:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
many women
 
05:37:34.070 --> 05:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
do feel differently and having that safe
 
05:37:38.708 --> 05:37:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:41.590 --> 05:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
i do think i'd like to also just say
 
05:37:41.600 --> 05:37:42.868 align:start position:0%
i do think i'd like to also just say
that

05:37:42.868 --> 05:37:42.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
while i can only speak on behalf of
 
05:37:46.230 --> 05:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
myself i do think that
 
05:37:49.190 --> 05:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
bills of this nature that limit
 
05:37:52.150 --> 05:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
doctors abilities to talk about
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
what is evidence-based and what is
 
05:37:57.990 --> 05:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
what is
 
05:38:01.430 --> 05:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
currently practiced in the medical field
 
05:38:03.430 --> 05:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
it really
 
05:38:05.350 --> 05:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
makes me not want to practice in the
 
05:38:06.788 --> 05:38:06.798 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
05:38:08.788 --> 05:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
i have a choice in where i practice when
 
05:38:10.948 --> 05:38:10.958 align:start position:0%
i finish my subspecialty training and
 
05:38:12.868 --> 05:38:12.878 align:start position:0%
these legislative
 
05:38:15.910 --> 05:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
issues and efforts to restrict access to
 
05:38:18.310 --> 05:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
life medical life-saving medical care
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
and risk restrict
 
05:38:22.390 --> 05:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
the autonomy of patients taking the
 
05:38:24.548 --> 05:38:24.558 align:start position:0%
choice out of patients and out of
 
05:38:28.150 --> 05:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
doctors hands and to penalize providers
 
05:38:28.160 --> 05:38:29.590 align:start position:0%
doctors hands and to penalize providers
for

05:38:29.590 --> 05:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:38:31.350 --> 05:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
providing those reasonable and safe
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
medical options in these horrible
 
05:38:35.910 --> 05:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
situations is frustrating i don't want
 
05:38:37.750 --> 05:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
to see the repercussions
 
05:38:39.350 --> 05:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
of these actions on the constituents of
 
05:38:41.510 --> 05:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i want to be able to
 
05:38:43.190 --> 05:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
provide all medically appropriate
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
options to my patients without the fear
 
05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
of legal ramifications i know i'm not
 
05:38:49.270 --> 05:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
alone in this
 
05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
please pass hb 1673 to repeal the
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
inflammatory bills
 
05:38:58.708 --> 05:38:58.718 align:start position:0%
the medical community is really trying
 
05:39:00.628 --> 05:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
to provide the best care possible and i
 
05:39:03.350 --> 05:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be so hard
 
05:39:05.910 --> 05:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
other questions for dr tolen
 
05:39:10.470 --> 05:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you dr tolen for taking my
 
05:39:14.150 --> 05:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman i'm
 
05:39:16.628 --> 05:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could help me
 
05:39:19.030 --> 05:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
understand something that i think will
 
05:39:21.190 --> 05:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
probably result in
 
05:39:24.470 --> 05:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
a translation of the legal words we have
 
05:39:24.480 --> 05:39:25.270 align:start position:0%
a translation of the legal words we have
here

05:39:25.270 --> 05:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:39:27.830 --> 05:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
to the medical practice so
 
05:39:29.910 --> 05:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing that
 
05:39:31.750 --> 05:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
there is an ultrasound
 
05:39:33.510 --> 05:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
examination requirement that's that's
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
the act is titled that
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
but then there's this question of
 
05:39:40.708 --> 05:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
a transvaginal ultrasound so i'm
 
05:39:42.868 --> 05:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
wondering based on your medical practice
 
05:39:44.548 --> 05:39:44.558 align:start position:0%
and your experience
 
05:39:46.548 --> 05:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
is there a scenario
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
where our general requirement of the
 
05:39:50.638 --> 05:39:51.990 align:start position:0%
where our general requirement of the
ultrasound

05:39:51.990 --> 05:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
ultrasound
 
05:39:54.708 --> 05:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
effectively translates into a medical
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
requirement for a transvaginal
 
05:39:59.270 --> 05:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
ultrasound or a more invasive ultrasound
 
05:40:00.628 --> 05:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
is there some scenario like that where
 
05:40:02.948 --> 05:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
it is a requirement effectively yes
 
05:40:04.070 --> 05:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:40:06.230 --> 05:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative page um
 
05:40:08.150 --> 05:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
it is confusing and i understand the
 
05:40:10.150 --> 05:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
confusion about the ultrasound i believe
 
05:40:11.910 --> 05:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
the way the law is written it requires
 
05:40:14.470 --> 05:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
an obstetrical ultrasound from a medical
 
05:40:16.310 --> 05:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
perspective an obstetrical ultrasound
 
05:40:18.788 --> 05:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
just means an ultrasound to be able to
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
look at
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
an embryo or a fetus depending on what
 
05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
gestational age that is
 
05:40:28.390 --> 05:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
depending on how large that embryo or
 
05:40:30.628 --> 05:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
fetus the term we use the terms
 
05:40:32.948 --> 05:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
differently depending on how far
 
05:40:35.510 --> 05:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
progressed it is basically um
 
05:40:37.350 --> 05:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
you may need to use a different type of
 
05:40:38.948 --> 05:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
ultrasound in order to obtain the
 
05:40:41.910 --> 05:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
necessary information so usually in the
 
05:40:43.750 --> 05:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
early part of pregnancy
 
05:40:45.270 --> 05:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:40:47.270 --> 05:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
rationale but behind performing an
 
05:40:49.510 --> 05:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is in order to confirm or
 
05:40:51.510 --> 05:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
determine the gestational age of a
 
05:40:55.190 --> 05:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
pregnancy how far along someone is and
 
05:40:58.390 --> 05:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
if the pregnancy is large enough you can
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
perform that ultrasound and get good
 
05:41:03.270 --> 05:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
measurements um using a probe on the
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
belly or an abdominal probe if the
 
05:41:08.150 --> 05:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is
 
05:41:11.590 --> 05:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
very very early it is
 
05:41:13.990 --> 05:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
very challenging to see that pregnancy
 
05:41:16.390 --> 05:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
because it's just not very big um you
 
05:41:18.230 --> 05:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
know it's it's it's like the size of a
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
walnut at the very beginning you can't
 
05:41:21.830 --> 05:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
see that with our ultrasound no matter
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
how good it is however
 
05:41:25.750 --> 05:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
the way we see it is by using a
 
05:41:27.270 --> 05:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound which
 
05:41:29.030 --> 05:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
essentially takes the sound rays of the
 
05:41:31.110 --> 05:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
ultrasound probe and puts them as close
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
to the uterus as possible and as close
 
05:41:35.430 --> 05:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
to the uterus as possible requires an
 
05:41:37.270 --> 05:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
internal probe
 
05:41:39.030 --> 05:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
which can be very challenging for many
 
05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
of my patients to undergo depending on
 
05:41:43.350 --> 05:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
whether they've had a history of trauma
 
05:41:46.948 --> 05:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
or depending on their physical anatomy
 
05:41:48.788 --> 05:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
okay other questions representative
 
05:41:48.798 --> 05:41:50.390 align:start position:0%
okay other questions representative

maclean
 
05:41:51.670 --> 05:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:41:52.948 --> 05:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:41:57.350 --> 05:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the in the 24-week window um
 
05:41:58.470 --> 05:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
which this
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
current law covers
 
05:42:02.390 --> 05:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
what kind of ultrasound would you be
 
05:42:06.150 --> 05:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
using to determine gestational age
 
05:42:06.160 --> 05:42:07.510 align:start position:0%
using to determine gestational age
well

05:42:07.510 --> 05:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:42:09.910 --> 05:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
you mean if if a patient if you already
 
05:42:11.990 --> 05:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
know the um gestational age of the
 
05:42:13.270 --> 05:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
patient i'm not sure
 
05:42:15.270 --> 05:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
if there is doubt
 
05:42:19.110 --> 05:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
that the gestational age is 24 weeks and
 
05:42:20.390 --> 05:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
so you want to go in to make that
 
05:42:20.400 --> 05:42:22.230 align:start position:0%
so you want to go in to make that
determination

05:42:22.230 --> 05:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
determination
 
05:42:25.590 --> 05:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
which ultrasound type would you use
 
05:42:27.910 --> 05:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
um in that
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
when you have doubt that it's 24 weeks
 
05:42:32.230 --> 05:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
sure so so if you have a patient who say
 
05:42:35.590 --> 05:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
based on their last menstrual period is
 
05:42:37.030 --> 05:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
suspects that their pregnancy is
 
05:42:39.270 --> 05:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 24 weeks you would use an
 
05:42:40.948 --> 05:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
abdominal ultrasound you do not need to
 
05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
use a transvaginal ultrasound at 24
 
05:42:45.990 --> 05:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
weeks if
 
05:42:47.190 --> 05:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
if you
 
05:42:50.628 --> 05:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
do not know the age of the pregnancy and
 
05:42:50.638 --> 05:42:51.750 align:start position:0%
do not know the age of the pregnancy and
and

05:42:51.750 --> 05:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:42:53.430 --> 05:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's very very early you may need to use
 
05:42:56.310 --> 05:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
a transvaginal ultrasound
 
05:42:57.190 --> 05:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:42:59.430 --> 05:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative nader
 
05:43:00.948 --> 05:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:43:02.070 --> 05:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
taking the question and thank you for
 
05:43:04.390 --> 05:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
your testimony today
 
05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
could you and tell me how many late-term
 
05:43:08.868 --> 05:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
abortions were performed in new
 
05:43:12.230 --> 05:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:14.310 --> 05:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
i actually don't have those numbers so i
 
05:43:16.708 --> 05:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
can't tell you exactly how many
 
05:43:19.270 --> 05:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
abortions are are performed later in
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
pregnancy it's quite uncommon nationally
 
05:43:25.110 --> 05:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
and from my just um
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know hearing uh it's not common and
 
05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
there's not not that many places that do
 
05:43:30.718 --> 05:43:31.670 align:start position:0%
there's not not that many places that do
it

05:43:31.670 --> 05:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:43:31.680 --> 05:43:33.350 align:start position:0%
it
however

05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
like i said
 
05:43:39.350 --> 05:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
the there are situations where
 
05:43:42.548 --> 05:43:42.558 align:start position:0%
fetal diagnoses that may not be apparent
 
05:43:45.430 --> 05:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
at the routine 20 week ultrasound that's
 
05:43:48.230 --> 05:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
previously been discussed there are many
 
05:43:49.990 --> 05:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
conditions that
 
05:43:54.150 --> 05:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
do not show up until later in particular
 
05:43:56.788 --> 05:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
one just comes to mind is in the third
 
05:44:00.310 --> 05:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
trimester there's a particularly um
 
05:44:02.470 --> 05:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
devastating fetal diagnosis called less
 
05:44:04.230 --> 05:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
encephalitis that cannot be seen until
 
05:44:06.868 --> 05:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
the third trimester there's situations
 
05:44:08.708 --> 05:44:08.718 align:start position:0%
where um
 
05:44:11.190 --> 05:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
where there are tragic fetal diagnoses
 
05:44:13.590 --> 05:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
that happen after 24 weeks so even
 
05:44:16.948 --> 05:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
though it is exceedingly uncommon it is
 
05:44:20.708 --> 05:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
still a a situation that occurs
 
05:44:22.548 --> 05:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
not um
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh anyway yeah it's a situation that
 
05:44:29.670 --> 05:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%

by our new hampshire legislature
 
05:45:26.470 --> 05:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
in a subsequent passing into law by

governor sununu
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
why is why the outrage you may ask this
 
05:45:33.590 --> 05:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
is this new law for the first time in
 
05:45:35.350 --> 05:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's history

via abortion procedure after 24 weeks
 
05:45:48.150 --> 05:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
from the con from conception to its
 
05:45:50.948 --> 05:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
natural birth date if you have any sense
 
05:45:53.030 --> 05:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
of morality and you are instinctively
 
05:45:55.750 --> 05:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
aware of what is right and wrong you may
 
05:45:57.830 --> 05:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
say wow this is great
 
05:46:00.070 --> 05:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
however according to the democratic
 
05:46:01.510 --> 05:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
party leadership
 
05:46:03.590 --> 05:46:03.600 align:start position:0%

with over one million dollars worth of
 
05:46:16.868 --> 05:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
ads demanding that fetal life protection
 
05:46:18.548 --> 05:46:18.558 align:start position:0%
act be overturned
 
05:46:18.558 --> 05:46:19.830 align:start position:0%
act be overturned
why

05:46:19.830 --> 05:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:46:22.788 --> 05:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
as the old saying goes follow the money
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
these new ads many of you may have
 
05:46:28.070 --> 05:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
already seen on tv or social media are
 
05:46:30.390 --> 05:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
expensive sleek and emotional
 
05:46:32.868 --> 05:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
under the guise of focusing only on a
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
mother's product reproduction rights
 
05:46:36.948 --> 05:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
a mother's health care
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
an inconvenience of having to carry
 
05:46:40.230 --> 05:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
their baby
 
05:46:43.350 --> 05:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
girl or boy to its natural birth date
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
so what happens when when an evil act of
 
05:46:47.750 --> 05:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
abortion is performed
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
the simple fact is an innocent
 
05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
defenseless baby is brutally killed in
 
05:46:53.670 --> 05:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
the mother's womb
 
05:46:56.230 --> 05:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
and yes they feel the pain
 
05:46:58.868 --> 05:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
and he or she is sucked out and thrown
 
05:47:02.230 --> 05:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
into the trash like common garbage
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
the dirty little secret is planned
 
05:47:06.070 --> 05:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
parenthood is in new hampshire
 
05:47:07.830 --> 05:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
and throughout the u.s
 
05:47:09.670 --> 05:47:09.680 align:start position:0%

05:47:16.310 --> 05:47:16.320 align:start position:0%

05:48:41.990 --> 05:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
battle between democrats and republicans
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
and you made the assertion
 
05:48:46.390 --> 05:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
that democratic candidates are taking
 
05:48:49.830 --> 05:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
money from planned parenthood
 
05:48:54.150 --> 05:48:54.160 align:start position:0%

i i did not say that every democrat is
 
05:49:01.920 --> 05:49:03.430 align:start position:0%
i i did not say that every democrat is
receiving

05:49:03.430 --> 05:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
05:49:05.110 --> 05:49:05.120 align:start position:0%

05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
relevancy but
 
05:49:28.470 --> 05:49:28.480 align:start position:0%

05:49:42.548 --> 05:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
you you talk about planned parenthood as
 
05:49:45.190 --> 05:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
if all they do is an abortion machine
 
05:49:47.190 --> 05:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the
 
05:49:49.270 --> 05:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood is mainly takes care
 
05:49:50.868 --> 05:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
of women's health
 
05:49:54.310 --> 05:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
and gives a lot of support with women
 
05:49:56.150 --> 05:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
through many different aspects of their
 
05:49:56.160 --> 05:49:57.270 align:start position:0%
through many different aspects of their
life

05:49:57.270 --> 05:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
this focus seems to just be on abortions
 
05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
and planned parenthood is not the only
 
05:50:04.470 --> 05:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
place that you could have an abortion
 
05:50:07.110 --> 05:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious why
 
05:50:07.120 --> 05:50:08.470 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious why
well

05:50:08.470 --> 05:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:50:10.708 --> 05:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
the answer is that
 
05:50:13.190 --> 05:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
the majority of their income comes from
 
05:50:15.670 --> 05:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
abortions without question it's a proven
 
05:50:15.680 --> 05:50:17.190 align:start position:0%
abortions without question it's a proven
fact

05:50:17.190 --> 05:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
fact
 
05:50:19.590 --> 05:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
granted they perform other services but
 
05:50:21.430 --> 05:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
the majority of their income on a
 
05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
national scale
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
is through abortion services
 
05:50:27.190 --> 05:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
that's the truth
 
05:50:28.708 --> 05:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
okay other
 
05:50:28.718 --> 05:50:31.510 align:start position:0%
okay other
questions

05:50:31.510 --> 05:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:50:32.788 --> 05:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan did you have a
 
05:50:32.798 --> 05:50:33.750 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan did you have a
question

05:50:33.750 --> 05:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:50:37.590 --> 05:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
oh probably i hope it's a question um
 
05:50:39.430 --> 05:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
which is uh where would i
 
05:50:42.708 --> 05:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
go to find the line items in their uh
 
05:50:45.510 --> 05:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
in their uh financial reports and
 
05:50:47.110 --> 05:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
actually just for full disclosure i've
 
05:50:49.110 --> 05:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
never received any money from them i do
 
05:50:50.948 --> 05:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
actually give them money every year so
 
05:50:53.510 --> 05:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:55.590 --> 05:50:55.600 align:start position:0%

their financial reports so i can verify

high school in durham new hampshire
 
05:51:45.990 --> 05:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to kind of sort of
 
05:51:47.270 --> 05:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
move closer to the microphone we're
 
05:51:48.948 --> 05:51:48.958 align:start position:0%

people like me
 
05:52:05.510 --> 05:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
i ask that you think of us when you vote
 
05:52:08.628 --> 05:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
because we are the people whose bodies
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
you are regulating with this legislation
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
we are the ones who these laws will
 
05:52:16.868 --> 05:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
affect in the future
 
05:52:18.948 --> 05:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
we are the ones who will spend a large
 
05:52:21.430 --> 05:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
portion of our lives
 
05:52:24.548 --> 05:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
with your decisions in effect
 
05:52:26.470 --> 05:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
we will either be grateful for the
 
05:52:28.310 --> 05:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
protections you have given us and given
 
05:52:29.430 --> 05:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
our bodies
 
05:52:32.628 --> 05:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
or we will have to fight against the
 
05:52:37.590 --> 05:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:37.600 --> 05:52:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:52:39.510 --> 05:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
look at us
 
05:52:42.708 --> 05:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
look at us and think of us when you vote
 
05:52:46.070 --> 05:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
we deserve control of our bodies we
 
05:52:49.670 --> 05:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
deserve privacy and we deserve safety
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
and we deserve the respect and trust
 
05:52:55.110 --> 05:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
that we can make our own decisions
 
05:52:58.150 --> 05:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
we are smart we are responsible
 
05:53:00.150 --> 05:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
and i assure you that we are perfectly
 
05:53:02.628 --> 05:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
capable of making decisions about what
 
05:53:04.628 --> 05:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
to do with our own bodies
 
05:53:05.670 --> 05:53:05.680 align:start position:0%

thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:53:15.110 --> 05:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
question and coming here to testify

thank all of you for being here i just
 
05:53:20.150 --> 05:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
have one question i'd like to ask you i
 
05:53:22.788 --> 05:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
wonder do you think it's appropriate for
 
05:53:25.990 --> 05:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature to tell pregnant people
 
05:53:28.548 --> 05:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
what to do with their bodies
 
05:53:30.788 --> 05:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:53:33.350 --> 05:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
no i do not think that is appropriate
 
05:53:35.030 --> 05:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
for a legislator
 
05:53:39.190 --> 05:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
to tell me what to do with my body um
 
05:53:39.200 --> 05:53:40.310 align:start position:0%
to tell me what to do with my body um
i

05:53:40.310 --> 05:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:53:42.548 --> 05:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
think it was akin to when my mother
 
05:53:44.150 --> 05:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
would when i would tell my mother i was
 
05:53:46.628 --> 05:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
sick and she would ask me well how sick
 
05:53:49.670 --> 05:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
how do you feel i don't have your body i
 
05:53:51.510 --> 05:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't know what you're feeling
 
05:53:53.910 --> 05:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
this legislator this committee does not
 
05:53:55.270 --> 05:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
have my body
 
05:53:58.230 --> 05:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
it does not have my life it cannot know
 
05:54:01.350 --> 05:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
what i am feeling what is good for me
 
05:54:04.070 --> 05:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
what i want to do with my life and what
 
05:54:06.948 --> 05:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
decision is best for me
 
05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
half of this committee does not even
 
05:54:11.670 --> 05:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to carry a baby
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
they cannot
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
understand what it is like to make that
 
05:54:15.840 --> 05:54:17.030 align:start position:0%
understand what it is like to make that
decision

05:54:17.030 --> 05:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:54:18.788 --> 05:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
therefore it should be left up to the
 
05:54:20.390 --> 05:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
women and
 
05:54:22.470 --> 05:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
people with uteruses
 
05:54:22.480 --> 05:54:23.350 align:start position:0%
people with uteruses

05:54:23.350 --> 05:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
have that shot have that
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
child in them to make the decision for
 
05:54:32.708 --> 05:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
them and what's best for their lives
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%

discuss my written testimony my my
 
05:55:22.868 --> 05:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
prepared testimony to address the
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
question of the transvaginal ultrasounds
 
05:55:27.430 --> 05:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's come up several times not only in
 
05:55:29.350 --> 05:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
this hearing but in other hearings
 
05:55:32.390 --> 05:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
related to the fetal life protection act
 
05:55:34.628 --> 05:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
where it's said that a transvaginal
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
ultrasound may be necessary in order to
 
05:55:39.030 --> 05:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
determine the gestational age of the
 
05:55:42.390 --> 05:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
child we heard earlier from an ob gyn
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
who talked about the very fact that a
 
05:55:47.510 --> 05:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound is likely only
 
05:55:49.830 --> 05:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
necessary in the early stages of
 
05:55:49.840 --> 05:55:50.948 align:start position:0%
necessary in the early stages of
pregnancy

05:55:50.948 --> 05:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
05:55:54.310 --> 05:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
if the woman is pregnant approximately
 
05:55:56.470 --> 05:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
at 24 weeks where there is as the
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
legislation at the law reads substantial
 
05:56:02.230 --> 05:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
risk that the child is 24 weeks it's
 
05:56:05.270 --> 05:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to be fairly obvious at that point
 
05:56:07.110 --> 05:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
that it is not necessary for a
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
transvaginal ultrasound to determine the
 
05:56:14.070 --> 05:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:17.510 --> 05:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
some of you recall last year during the
 
05:56:21.910 --> 05:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb 1625 i shared the story of
 
05:56:21.920 --> 05:56:22.948 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb 1625 i shared the story of
my

05:56:28.868 --> 05:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
friend and my college roommate who had a
 
05:56:31.270 --> 05:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
lethal fetal diagnosis of her daughter
 
05:56:35.750 --> 05:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
cecilia at 18 weeks at their ultrasound
 
05:56:37.830 --> 05:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
and they chose to
 
05:56:40.070 --> 05:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
carry the child to term despite the fact
 
05:56:42.868 --> 05:56:42.878 align:start position:0%
that the child had a diagnosis that was
 
05:56:45.670 --> 05:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
basically a severe form of dwarfism such
 
05:56:48.470 --> 05:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
that the rib cage at the time that
 
05:56:50.868 --> 05:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
cecilia would breathe her first breath
 
05:56:50.878 --> 05:56:51.910 align:start position:0%
cecilia would breathe her first breath
without

05:56:51.910 --> 05:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
without
 
05:56:53.750 --> 05:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
outside of the womb that she would
 
05:56:53.760 --> 05:56:54.868 align:start position:0%
outside of the womb that she would
smother

05:56:54.868 --> 05:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
smother
 
05:56:54.878 --> 05:56:55.910 align:start position:0%
smother
and

05:56:55.910 --> 05:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:56:58.708 --> 05:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
they did in fact deliver at 40 weeks she
 
05:57:01.510 --> 05:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
went into natural labor and
 
05:57:03.910 --> 05:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
she was born alive but died a couple of
 
05:57:06.470 --> 05:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
hours later not being able to breathe
 
05:57:09.350 --> 05:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that the life that
 
05:57:11.750 --> 05:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
she had during that time in the womb and
 
05:57:13.750 --> 05:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
the influence that she had on so many
 
05:57:16.230 --> 05:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
others was incredibly powerful and the
 
05:57:17.910 --> 05:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
fact that they were able to carry the
 
05:57:20.390 --> 05:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
baby to term and to go into labor
 
05:57:22.708 --> 05:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
naturally allowed the opportunity for
 
05:57:25.030 --> 05:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
the family to hold the child to have the
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
baby baptized and it was truly a
 
05:57:30.310 --> 05:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
beautiful life and a beautiful death and
 
05:57:32.470 --> 05:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
none of it was easy that's for sure i
 
05:57:35.030 --> 05:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
had the blessing of journeying through
 
05:57:37.750 --> 05:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
her with that pregnancy
 
05:57:39.990 --> 05:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
i want to share my personal story now
 
05:57:42.788 --> 05:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
and that is that with my last pregnancy
 
05:57:44.868 --> 05:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
in 2015
 
05:57:48.230 --> 05:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
i was diagnosed at 18 weeks with a
 
05:57:48.240 --> 05:57:49.830 align:start position:0%
i was diagnosed at 18 weeks with a
developmental

05:57:49.830 --> 05:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
05:57:52.070 --> 05:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
issue with my son
 
05:57:54.390 --> 05:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
and a couple of days later i had a level
 
05:57:57.190 --> 05:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
2 ultrasound and at that time he was
 
05:57:59.350 --> 05:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with a congenital fetal
 
05:58:00.948 --> 05:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
anomaly although it wasn't
 
05:58:03.030 --> 05:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
life-threatening it would require a
 
05:58:05.590 --> 05:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
number of surgeries and that he would be
 
05:58:07.590 --> 05:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
on medication for the rest of his life
 
05:58:10.230 --> 05:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
we were given options of term the option
 
05:58:11.990 --> 05:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
of terminating their pregnancy of having
 
05:58:14.150 --> 05:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
an abortion another way to say it
 
05:58:16.070 --> 05:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
my husband and i chose to pursue a
 
05:58:18.548 --> 05:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
second opinion in boston at boston
 
05:58:20.310 --> 05:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
children's hospital
 
05:58:21.830 --> 05:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
and we went through a series of tests
 
05:58:24.070 --> 05:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
over the course of the day 15 seconds
 
05:58:27.430 --> 05:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
with multiple different physicians and
 
05:58:29.750 --> 05:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
it was concluded that there was nothing
 
05:58:31.430 --> 05:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
wrong with the child and that they
 
05:58:33.190 --> 05:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
didn't understand the diagnosis and
 
05:58:34.868 --> 05:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
although we didn't know for sure until
 
05:58:38.150 --> 05:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
he was born he was born completely fine
 
05:58:40.470 --> 05:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i often wonder what other women
 
05:58:42.230 --> 05:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
would have chosen who wouldn't have been
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
able to have the ability and to go and
 
05:58:48.628 --> 05:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
receive a second opinion and i can tell
 
05:58:51.430 --> 05:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
you that our sons would be deprived of
 
05:58:53.110 --> 05:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
the blessing of their little baby
 
05:58:55.030 --> 05:58:55.040 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:59:19.670 --> 05:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um we've heard
 
05:59:22.150 --> 05:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
some concerns about the existing bill a
 
05:59:24.470 --> 05:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion about the ultrasounds
 
05:59:26.230 --> 05:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
which you kind of clarified
 
05:59:29.110 --> 05:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
another area of concern was just with
 
05:59:31.430 --> 05:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
the fatal fetal anomalies and they're
 
05:59:33.910 --> 05:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
saying there is no exception in the law
 
05:59:36.230 --> 05:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
for that it was discussed in earlier
 
05:59:38.868 --> 05:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
testimony that massachusetts for a very
 
05:59:42.150 --> 05:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
extended period up until 2019
 
05:59:45.430 --> 05:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
also had a 24-week ban without any
 
05:59:48.070 --> 05:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
exceptions for for fatal fetal anomalies
 
05:59:50.390 --> 05:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
do you either personally or in your
 
05:59:54.070 --> 05:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
capacity with cornerstone um have any
 
05:59:56.070 --> 05:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
information or data
 
05:59:58.150 --> 05:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
about you know how the fatal fetal
 
05:59:59.750 --> 05:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
anomalies were addressed in
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts during that time
 
06:00:03.750 --> 06:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
and how they were able to navigate that
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
particular issue
 
06:00:07.350 --> 06:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
well it's been said a number of times
 
06:00:09.670 --> 06:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the hearings that having a
 
06:00:11.590 --> 06:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
law like we do on the books now would
 
06:00:13.830 --> 06:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
cause us to be challenged in being able
 
06:00:17.430 --> 06:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
to recruit physicians um and we can say
 
06:00:20.150 --> 06:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
with confidence that massachusetts never
 
06:00:22.230 --> 06:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
reported having those issues of
 
06:00:24.150 --> 06:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
recruitment especially considering the
 
06:00:25.830 --> 06:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
fact that they are ranked in the top
 
06:00:28.708 --> 06:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
three of medical providers in the entire
 
06:00:28.718 --> 06:00:31.430 align:start position:0%
three of medical providers in the entire
country

06:00:31.430 --> 06:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:34.310 --> 06:00:34.320 align:start position:0%

mr chairman my name is margaret dry i'm
 
06:00:55.830 --> 06:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
from plainfield new hampshire
 
06:00:58.548 --> 06:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
today is day 41 for the fetal life
 
06:01:01.030 --> 06:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
protection act though on the books less
 
06:01:03.750 --> 06:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
than six weeks already it's been had a
 
06:01:06.150 --> 06:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
number of chances to repeal it
 
06:01:08.310 --> 06:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
a bill to clarify it hasn't even made
 
06:01:10.070 --> 06:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
the house floor yet
 
06:01:12.628 --> 06:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
rebuild repealing the statute would
 
06:01:14.708 --> 06:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
allow abortion without restriction
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
throughout pregnancy in new hampshire
 
06:01:17.520 --> 06:01:18.310 align:start position:0%
throughout pregnancy in new hampshire
the

06:01:18.310 --> 06:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
common reasons given for allowing
 
06:01:22.230 --> 06:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
abortion after 24 weeks are that it is
 
06:01:24.470 --> 06:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
rare and then it usually includes a
 
06:01:24.480 --> 06:01:25.910 align:start position:0%
rare and then it usually includes a
fatal

06:01:25.910 --> 06:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
fatal
 
06:01:28.868 --> 06:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly or the risk of the mother
 
06:01:30.948 --> 06:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
last month i sat through testimonies
 
06:01:32.548 --> 06:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
from mothers
 
06:01:34.948 --> 06:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
all around the state who though given
 
06:01:37.030 --> 06:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
discouraging diagnoses like you've heard
 
06:01:39.350 --> 06:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
today ended up giving birth to healthy
 
06:01:39.360 --> 06:01:40.390 align:start position:0%
today ended up giving birth to healthy
children

06:01:40.390 --> 06:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:01:43.030 --> 06:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
i sat behind the young woman who was
 
06:01:45.670 --> 06:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
born at 24 weeks gestation and
 
06:01:48.548 --> 06:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
admired her as i listened to her read
 
06:01:50.470 --> 06:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
her testimony
 
06:01:53.670 --> 06:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
we have almost 50 years of technological
 
06:01:55.510 --> 06:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
and medical advances that weren't
 
06:01:58.310 --> 06:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
available now back in 1973 when roe v
 
06:01:59.910 --> 06:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
wade was decided
 
06:02:01.590 --> 06:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
why are we trying to take our abortion
 
06:02:04.548 --> 06:02:04.558 align:start position:0%
law back to 1973
 
06:02:07.270 --> 06:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
when presented with hard cases we have a
 
06:02:09.670 --> 06:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
choice before us we should choose to
 
06:02:12.470 --> 06:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
treat two patients involved trying the
 
06:02:14.390 --> 06:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
best to save both
 
06:02:16.390 --> 06:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
knowing that sometimes we won't get the
 
06:02:18.310 --> 06:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
outcome that we want
 
06:02:20.470 --> 06:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
with all due respect for the very moving
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that i heard here of the
 
06:02:24.708 --> 06:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
mother that delivered that baby
 
06:02:26.708 --> 06:02:26.718 align:start position:0%
with hydroencephaly
 
06:02:28.390 --> 06:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
repealing this law
 
06:02:30.868 --> 06:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't open a door just for fetal
 
06:02:30.878 --> 06:02:32.150 align:start position:0%
doesn't open a door just for fetal
anomaly

06:02:32.150 --> 06:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
anomaly
 
06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
it opens the door for everything no
 
06:02:34.558 --> 06:02:36.830 align:start position:0%
it opens the door for everything no
reason

06:02:36.830 --> 06:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
reason
 
06:02:39.350 --> 06:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
whatsoever there is a big difference
 
06:02:41.270 --> 06:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
between working for good outcomes for
 
06:02:43.510 --> 06:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
both the mother and the child and not
 
06:02:44.948 --> 06:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
getting both
 
06:02:47.990 --> 06:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
and deliberately causing a bad outcome
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
for one of them
 
06:02:53.110 --> 06:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
i ask that you vote hb 1673 in expedient
 
06:02:55.190 --> 06:02:55.200 align:start position:0%

goffstown new hampshire
 
06:03:21.190 --> 06:03:21.200 align:start position:0%

06:03:24.470 --> 06:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
and i am here reading the testimony of
 
06:03:25.910 --> 06:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
deborah bishop
 
06:03:28.548 --> 06:03:28.558 align:start position:0%
of where new hampshire she was scheduled
 
06:03:31.270 --> 06:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
to appear but had a medical emergency
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
with her mother so she's asked me to
 
06:03:35.270 --> 06:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
read her testimony on her behalf if that
 
06:03:36.868 --> 06:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
would be all right as long as you can do
 
06:03:38.788 --> 06:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
it within three minutes
 
06:03:41.350 --> 06:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
this is from debbie when i discovered i
 
06:03:44.150 --> 06:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
was pregnant at 22 and unmarried i
 
06:03:46.548 --> 06:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
immediately set a date for an abortion
 
06:03:48.948 --> 06:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
at the recommendation of my doctor the
 
06:03:50.708 --> 06:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
insurance at my job at the time would
 
06:03:52.470 --> 06:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
cover all expenses
 
06:03:54.230 --> 06:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
after a few days of wrestling with my
 
06:03:56.470 --> 06:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
decision i decided to cancel the
 
06:03:58.628 --> 06:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
appointment and moved instead in the
 
06:04:00.230 --> 06:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
direction of adoption
 
06:04:03.030 --> 06:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
my daughter was born in may of 82 and
 
06:04:05.430 --> 06:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
she became the sheer joy of a couple who
 
06:04:07.510 --> 06:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
were unable to conceive
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
three years later my husband and i
 
06:04:11.270 --> 06:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
discovered we were pregnant with a baby
 
06:04:14.310 --> 06:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
boy and we were overjoyed however after
 
06:04:17.030 --> 06:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
some testing and an amniocentesis
 
06:04:18.868 --> 06:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
it was determined that the possibility
 
06:04:21.590 --> 06:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
of fetal anomalies is significant
 
06:04:21.600 --> 06:04:23.110 align:start position:0%
of fetal anomalies is significant
impending

06:04:23.110 --> 06:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
impending
 
06:04:26.310 --> 06:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
intrauterine fetal demise or severe
 
06:04:29.270 --> 06:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
intrauterine growth retardation are also
 
06:04:31.670 --> 06:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
possibilities another possibility is
 
06:04:33.990 --> 06:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
congenital neurosis
 
06:04:35.830 --> 06:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
although some infants can survive for
 
06:04:36.948 --> 06:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
short time
 
06:04:39.110 --> 06:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
it appears that congenital neurosis is
 
06:04:40.708 --> 06:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
invariably fatal
 
06:04:42.948 --> 06:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
this fetus is extremely high risk for
 
06:04:44.628 --> 06:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
having some other type of fetal
 
06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
abnormalities or impending fetal demise
 
06:04:50.310 --> 06:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
if the pregnancy continues to viability
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
etc etc as you can imagine we're
 
06:04:55.830 --> 06:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
devastated at this news but rejected the
 
06:04:58.070 --> 06:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the doctor to end the
 
06:05:00.470 --> 06:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
life of our baby boy in the womb and
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
rather chose life
 
06:05:05.430 --> 06:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
adam wesley was born in june of 85 and
 
06:05:07.510 --> 06:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
whisked away from us immediately upon
 
06:05:10.310 --> 06:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
delivery to be inspected for any norman
 
06:05:12.788 --> 06:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
abnormalities he was brought back to us
 
06:05:15.110 --> 06:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
a short time later and told you have a
 
06:05:17.910 --> 06:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly healthy baby boy
 
06:05:20.070 --> 06:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
20 years and 10 months later during the
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
mother's day flood here in new hampshire
 
06:05:26.390 --> 06:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
in 2006 his life came to a tragic end
 
06:05:28.390 --> 06:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
when his car veered off the road and he
 
06:05:31.030 --> 06:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
was killed instantly while driving home
 
06:05:34.230 --> 06:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
from liberty liberty university to make
 
06:05:36.150 --> 06:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
a surprise visit to me on mother's day
 
06:05:36.160 --> 06:05:37.110 align:start position:0%
a surprise visit to me on mother's day
morning

06:05:37.110 --> 06:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
morning
 
06:05:39.750 --> 06:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
little did i know 20 fewer years before
 
06:05:39.760 --> 06:05:40.548 align:start position:0%
little did i know 20 fewer years before
this

06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:05:42.390 --> 06:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
it would be the daughter i had given up
 
06:05:43.670 --> 06:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
for adoption
 
06:05:46.390 --> 06:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
who would be the bomb of my broken heart
 
06:05:48.390 --> 06:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
needed while grieving the death of my
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
second child
 
06:05:51.830 --> 06:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
she had come to find us just 20 months
 
06:05:55.190 --> 06:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
before adam's death she calls me mom
 
06:05:57.990 --> 06:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
she phones me at least once a day and as
 
06:06:00.548 --> 06:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
if we were never separated i often think
 
06:06:02.788 --> 06:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
of the loss i would have faced if i had
 
06:06:04.948 --> 06:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
decided on abortion for either of these
 
06:06:07.830 --> 06:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
people i would have missed out on 21
 
06:06:10.470 --> 06:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
years of my son's life and now to have
 
06:06:12.470 --> 06:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
both my daughters to help me bear the
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
burden of losing him has 50 seconds
 
06:06:17.830 --> 06:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
he filled my empty arms when i chose
 
06:06:20.150 --> 06:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
adoption and she has helped me to mend
 
06:06:22.628 --> 06:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
my broken heart after his death
 
06:06:24.070 --> 06:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
06:06:27.670 --> 06:06:27.680 align:start position:0%

and then the last card i have will be
 
06:06:37.110 --> 06:06:37.120 align:start position:0%

for state representative perez after
that

06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:42.310 --> 06:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
my name is kelly potenza i live in
 
06:06:44.390 --> 06:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
rochester new hampshire
 
06:06:45.670 --> 06:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
i strongly
 
06:06:45.680 --> 06:06:47.030 align:start position:0%
i strongly
oppose

06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
06:06:48.868 --> 06:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:06:51.590 --> 06:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
i think we have to be very clear
 
06:06:53.990 --> 06:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
about what this is this legislation that
 
06:06:54.000 --> 06:06:55.110 align:start position:0%
about what this is this legislation that
passed

06:06:55.110 --> 06:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
passed
 
06:06:58.230 --> 06:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
that has barely been in place
 
06:07:00.708 --> 06:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
it is truly
 
06:07:01.990 --> 06:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
a modest
 
06:07:03.350 --> 06:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
modest means
 
06:07:06.470 --> 06:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's um really stopping partial birth
 
06:07:06.480 --> 06:07:07.590 align:start position:0%
it's um really stopping partial birth
abortions

06:07:07.590 --> 06:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
06:07:09.510 --> 06:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if everybody knows what
 
06:07:13.030 --> 06:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
that is these are viable babies that can
 
06:07:14.628 --> 06:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
live outside the womb
 
06:07:16.628 --> 06:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
and so we're not talking about
 
06:07:19.270 --> 06:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
women's you know a woman's choice and in
 
06:07:21.670 --> 06:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
just her body and all of that there's a
 
06:07:24.470 --> 06:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
living breathing viable baby in there as
 
06:07:26.548 --> 06:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
well that needs to be considered
 
06:07:28.708 --> 06:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
and so in regards with partial birth
 
06:07:30.788 --> 06:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
abortion we obviously all know about the
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
partial birth abortion ban act that came
 
06:07:35.590 --> 06:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
from the feds years ago
 
06:07:39.270 --> 06:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to just
 
06:07:43.190 --> 06:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
describe what it really is
 
06:07:45.030 --> 06:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's basically when
 
06:07:46.548 --> 06:07:46.558 align:start position:0%
performing abortion deliberately and
 
06:07:48.548 --> 06:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
intentionally vaginally delivers a
 
06:07:50.470 --> 06:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
living fetus
 
06:07:52.628 --> 06:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
until the breach presentation any part
 
06:07:54.548 --> 06:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
of the fetus drunk past the navels
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
outside the body the mother and then
 
06:07:58.830 --> 06:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
kills the baby
 
06:08:01.350 --> 06:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
um this basically
 
06:08:01.360 --> 06:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
um this basically
is

06:08:02.230 --> 06:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:08:02.240 --> 06:08:05.190 align:start position:0%
is
a

06:08:05.190 --> 06:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:07.350 --> 06:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know abortions puncture the base of
 
06:08:09.110 --> 06:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
the baby's skull with its surgical
 
06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
instruments such as a long surgical
 
06:08:14.150 --> 06:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
scissors or a pointed hollow metal tube
 
06:08:16.948 --> 06:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
called a trocar then inserts a catheter
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
into the wound and removes the baby's
 
06:08:20.948 --> 06:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
brain with a powerful suction machine
 
06:08:23.510 --> 06:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
this causes the skull to collapse
 
06:08:25.350 --> 06:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
after which the abortionist completes
 
06:08:29.190 --> 06:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
the delivery of the now dead baby
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is horrific
 
06:08:33.510 --> 06:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we have people here that want to
 
06:08:35.270 --> 06:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
remove that
 
06:08:38.070 --> 06:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
24 weeks
 
06:08:40.310 --> 06:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's already against federal law
 
06:08:42.548 --> 06:08:42.558 align:start position:0%
what are we doing here and i'd like to
 
06:08:43.830 --> 06:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
speak about what the gentleman from
 
06:08:46.708 --> 06:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
wyndham said this is not a democrat or a
 
06:08:49.430 --> 06:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
republican issue because we have many
 
06:08:51.750 --> 06:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
people that are that have the r by their
 
06:08:51.760 --> 06:08:52.868 align:start position:0%
people that are that have the r by their
name
