um there are a number of people who also
 
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
co- requesting the introduction of uh
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and can they participate in
 
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't think so uh uh Mr leader I
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
think you know why don't you make your
 
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
presentation and we'll go from there
 
00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
okay um I would request uh permission
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
for a late introduction of a bill that
 
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
would amend the um the house uh to the
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
legislative uh Ethics Committee to allow
 
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
for a a provision um that there could be
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
to amend it to right now we have
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
Provisions that relate to um uh sexual
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
um abuse and misconduct and financial
 
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
and exploitative and this would allow it
 
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
to include um uh act actions that were
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
uh engaged in by members of the
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
legislature uh that would constitute um
 
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
violations that would that would be
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
considered um harassment uh of based
 
00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 align:start position:0%
upon uh
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
specific conditions that are included um
 
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
in the resolution as I presented it to
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
you and I would ask that you allow this
 
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
to be in the reason that this is comes
 
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
as a late request is
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
because subsequent to the closing and
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
the filing period uh it uh became public
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge that a member had posted what
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
uh as I looked at it was kind of a vile
 
00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 align:start position:0%
uh hurtful and um quite frankly
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh meme on Facebook page um I
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
think that's the that's the type of
 
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
activity that should not be condoned by
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature I think by making a
 
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
provision uh where it would be um that a
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
complaint could be filed with the um
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
with the Ethics Committee it would
 
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 align:start position:0%
provide for um for process a due process
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
for anyone who would be um for for whom
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
it would be uh the the the misconduct
 
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
would be um alleged and provide for a
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
mechanism to to hear that to gather
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
facts and make a recommendation akin to
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
the way that we deal sexual misconduct
 
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
akin to the way that we deal with
 
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
problems with you know self-dealing with
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
financial interest and it became
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
necessary because quite frankly I until
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
I saw that it never had I I could not
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
believe that that typee of uh you what
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
would be like hate speech um directed it
 
00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh a vulnerable population would be
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
engaged in by a member of the
 
00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:11.629 align:start position:0%
engaged in by a member of the
legislature

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
so are there any

go ahead
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you chairman um so
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
I am requesting late drafting for a
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
simple resolution to deem emergency
 
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
order 76
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um obviously the reason
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
for late drafting would be that uh the
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
order wasn't signed until last
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
Friday um but it is unconstitutional it
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
was only in 2018 that the citizens of
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
this state decided uh to add a article
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
2B which protects their privacy and
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state should be able to
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
have their vaccination status private if
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
they so choose this order also violates
 
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.069 align:start position:0%
they so choose this order also violates
article

00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
article
 
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
29 um in article 29 it states that only
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
the legislator May uh suspend law and
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
yet he has suspended multiple laws in
 
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
this order now this resolution is simply
 
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
a statement that the is here that we are
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
going to be willing participants in this
 
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
process and it is a reminder that he
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
does not have the authority to um
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm I'm sorry not having anything
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
in front of me I am not not sure which
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
emergency order and what the content of
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
the emergency order is we're talking
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
about so this is emergency order 76
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
which was the one uh that made the
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
registry the vaccine registry um uh not
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
able to opt
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
out um for the purpose of the covid-19
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
vacine uh currently the way that the
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
registry is written um it is a voluntary
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh process when the registry was written
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
it needed to be voluntary to be able to
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
be constitutional and this eliminates
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
the ability for it to be
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
voluntary and my understanding is that
 
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry Mr may I have go ahead go
 
00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
ahead resentative uh thank you and thank
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
you for taking my followup um am I
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
correct in understanding that although
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
the participation has become mandatory
 
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
there is no disclosure it's just the
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
particip ation that you're objecting
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
to correct correct so um everybody's
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
vaccination status will as far as the
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine will now be tracked um
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
either they will be in the registry
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
because they received the vaccine um or
 
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
they will be in there because they did
 
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
not uh get the vaccine thank you very
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%

resolution it is a simple house
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
resolution again it's just a statement
 
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
um it would not actually be able to
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
resend we don't have the power to
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
actually resend an order this is just a
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%

um representative wasborn
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
do um so while are we allowed to discuss
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
at this point or do we need a motion
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
first or um why don't we get a motion
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
it Mr chair representative Cushing had
 
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
raised his
 
00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
hand okay I'm sorry representative
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
cushion um Mr sh I'll move to not allow
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
it okay is there a
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
second okay representative Webber
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
seconds it yes now we can discuss the
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
motion go ahead representative Bron okay
 
00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:46.150 align:start position:0%
motion go ahead representative Bron okay
so

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
um so on on this one I see the
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
um uh the matter of urgency uh just
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
because of the uh the timing of this
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
order Rel relative to our deadlines so
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
in in that respect I
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
um I can be agreeable to that um if if
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
it's just a a resolution that um doesn't
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't do anything I guess
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
guess that question yeah I you know I
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
just don't understand why um
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
having not recognized the urgency of
 
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
trying to do something when um hate
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
speech is being uh engaged in uh by
 
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:49.959 align:start position:0%
legislators and um not having a clear
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
provision on how to do it that the the
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
that that legislation was dismissed and
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
now um we want to see because someone
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
the government took action um we want to
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
allow that in I just don't understand I
 
00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:06.519 align:start position:0%
want to at least have some consistency
 
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
in what we're not going to allow
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
in further
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
discussion senator Rice representative
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
Stephen Smith and then represent
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
B thank you so first of all my take on
 
00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:26.759 align:start position:0%
this is um I'm not telling anyone what
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinations I get I I don't care what
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
executive order it is it's it's my
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
personal business and it's quite frankly
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
between me and my doctor but I don't see
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
the purpose of doing this I I I think
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's a posturing move but I it really
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
has no effect I mean I think the
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
governor knows how we feel about this
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
necessary representative Smith
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I disagree with
 
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
representative Cushing that this act
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
relates to the earlier one because we
 
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
already have a process in place to deal
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
with egregious ethics violations and
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
we've used it before so we know it works
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
in this case I mean representative BLC
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
has a point in expressing the will of
 
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
the house on something that happened
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
after the filing deadline and that's how
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
it's different um having said that the
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
res resolution bill will still go
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
through the whole process if we actually
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to do something about it couldn't
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
an amendment be introduced to one of the
 
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
other executive order bills to raise
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
this issue and have a discussion on it
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
without um going around the rules
 
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
process so I guess I kind of ended with
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
an inquiry of the chair or the
 
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.470 align:start position:0%
an inquiry of the chair or the
clerk

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
sorry well I I I will attempt to uh give
 
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
you what I perceive to be and then the
 
00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
clerk can step in if I State anything
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
but I do believe that uh there's what
 
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
four or five bills that have to do with
 
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
the emergency orders uh Mr clerk am I
 
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
correct I've seen several lsrs um that
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
are are specific to the state of
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
emergency and and the various orders
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
deriving there
 
00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
from okay
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
um personally I do not like the idea
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
whatsoever of a state regist
 
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
I I I'm afraid that um personal
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
information like that could easily get
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
out but I
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
also am concerned about the separate
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
resolution when something could be added
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
um kind of in a little quander about
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
this one myself because I agree with the
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
principle of it but I'm not sure this is
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
r i i I agree with you representative
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
Packard I think that let's let's try to
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
keep everything all together I don't
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
think there's a need to to draft
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
anything new let's add an amendment to
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
the already existing um executive order
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that's out
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
there okay representative Tim Smith has
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
his hand up Mr chair uh go ahead Miss uh
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith Tim Smith yeah I
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm also inclined to agree um with
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative Packard uh you know I'm I
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
don't like speaking as a tech guy um I
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
have serious concerns about the privacy
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
of this registry um but I'm I'm not sure
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
that late introduction of a house
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
resolution that would not have the force
 
00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
of law is really the vehicle to um
 
00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
express our our feelings on that I would
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
be more inclined to support the late
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
introduction of a concurrent resolution
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
um than a house resolution and if if the
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
member would like to proceed with just
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
the house resolution I I think the
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
member can just move to suspend the
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
rules in so far as you know through the
 
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
normal process um and and let that play
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
out on the floor or add the amendment as
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
was suggested um onto one of those other
 
00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:16.190 align:start position:0%
was suggested um onto one of those other
existing

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
bills I I oh go ahead representative
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
question no just an inquiry of the of
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
the cleric or or or or the the chair are
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
any of the legislation that are directed
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
at that that relate to the emergency uh
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
orders of the governor um are any of
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
those resolutions or are they all for
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
bills you
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
know um I can uh take a look if you give
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
me just a moment I mean I guess the
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
reason I I I I asking this is because I
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
know that under our rules the director
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
of legislative Services um when receives
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
a request from uh on a subject matter
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
from more than one legislator there's an
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
effort to try to get them to combine the
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh as I don't think
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
there have been any bills that have been
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
introduced or signed off on isn't the
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
isn't it a possibility that that the
 
00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
that the individual could go to one of
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of the um what have already
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
been filed lsrs and seek to incorporate
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
the you know that language seek to
 
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
address that um executive order in that
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
um in what's already an existing LSR
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I do have the answer to
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
the question representative Cushings ask
 
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:35.559 align:start position:0%
if you'd like thank you yes please um
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
the lsrs that have been uh filed
 
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the the emergency um do all
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
appear to be HBS at the moment um and I
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
do want to just to to clarify um the
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
statute RSA 4-4 equal 445 um is is
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
specific that um a concurrent resolution
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
um can end the state of emergency period
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
um it does not speak to individual
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
emergency orders um so I I wanted to
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
clarify that and our our legal council
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
is on the line if you if you do want to
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
ask any questions there as well so if
 
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
I'm correct and what you're saying Mr
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
clerk is that if we accepted this it
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
would nullify all the emergency orders
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
no this this is so if it's a resolution
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
just a simple house resolution
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
stating a position of the house it does
 
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
not have any in fact force of law or
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
anything it is basically a a policy um
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
statement and representative Weber has
 
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.510 align:start position:0%
statement and representative Weber has
sir

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
oh you have your hand up representer
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
Weber oh okay I'm sorry go ahead thank
 
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker um I think that really
 
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
the nub of the matter is that we have a
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
number of vehicles the the if if one is
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about being added to the
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
registry you need a law to make sure
 
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be added to the
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
registry and it's very much a debate
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
worth having but we already have a
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
number of vehicles available to us for
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
that debate all of which can be amended
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
and all of which would have the force of
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
law passed by the house so for that
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
reason and being very sensitive to the
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
fact that adding more debate and more
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
time to our calendars is going to be
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
very difficult this year uh I am going
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
to vote uh in favor of uh denying the
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
late drafting in this case knowing that
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
there is an appropriate way that the
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
representative can address the issue so
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
that all of us can have a proper debate
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
on it and a final floor action if
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
necessary thank
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
um as I said I personally am against
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
this registry I I I have very serious
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
concerns about being able to keep safe
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's medical records and I would
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
rather see this myself in the
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
law and move
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
quickly then passing a resolution that
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
isn't going to accomplish anything uh
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's a basically a statement saying that
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
we disapprove of it um and I will say
 
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:27.799 align:start position:0%
categorically right here I disapprove of
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
it but passing a resolution at this
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
point to me it's it's it's making a
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
statement but it's meaningless I would
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
much rather see this into law and I
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
would be glad to work with the
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
representative to find a place to put it
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
roll the motion is to not allow
 
00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.789 align:start position:0%
roll the motion is to not allow
representative

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:38.190 align:start position:0%
 
someplace

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:48.679 align:start position:0%

65 is there a second
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
a second okay uh
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
discussion this is um yeah what we
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
discussed if I'm
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
correct about two three weeks ago am I
 
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
correct Mr Clark this was it is Sir
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative Weber has raised her hand
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
okay and I think representative kushin
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
Weber sorry I would defer to
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
representative Cushing oh go go ahead
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weber oh okay uh then I
 
00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
won't uh my my only concern is that
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
under January
 
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
15th uh one of the second entry is last
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
day to amend House Rules by majority
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
vote which is very much in in keeping
 
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
with our normal proceedings but I'm
 
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about only about that one line
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
in case we find that things are
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
cumbersome on January 6th then we have
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
to have a an abbrevi ated meeting on
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
January 6th then we only have the the
 
00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:08.919 align:start position:0%
15th to allow house members to bring in
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
um their um amendments to house rules
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
and because it is such an important
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
thing and because it is um uh because
 
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799 align:start position:0%
we're still sorting out how things are
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
going to proceed I I wonder if that
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
could be phrased something more like uh
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
the first session after January 6th or
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
the second session after January 6 so
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
there's a little more leeway there uh
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
but that's that's my only concern and
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure how we do that or
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
whether we we move that date a little
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
later but knowing that we may not have a
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
session on the
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
15th um you know that that's makes it
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
seem a little worrisome in terms of
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
giving people an opportunity to make
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
discussion is there
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
um any clarification you might have Mr
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
clerk uh no sir that's um if you if you
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
choose to move that to another date you
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
are welcome to I I would only state that
 
00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:28.710 align:start position:0%
are welcome to I I would only state that
we

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
um uh we would typically we we've never
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
not had a date assigned to something um
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
so to to put in um if you wanted to make
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
it such that it wasn't a date um I would
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
suggest that maybe um adding a a a
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
subsection B um that stated the last day
 
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
to amend House Rules by majority vote
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
would be the session um following the
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
January 6th session or something along
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
those lines we you could you could do
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
that if that uh is what you would like
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
to do uh I see that representative Weber
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
has raised her hand again and
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative Tim Smith has raised his
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
hand okay I would ver oh representative
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
Weber go ahead I'm sorry I would very
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
much like to move that we draft it in
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
draft that change in accordance with the
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
clerk's recommendation the other thing I
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
had thought was that perhaps to keep it
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
cleaner we could have this session
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
deadlines drafted exactly as they are
 
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
and as we would in any other year and
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
then have a rule somewhere else that we
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps in in the section on emergency
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
rules uh to be adopted later that we add
 
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:46.519 align:start position:0%
in a section there that says uh not
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
withstanding the deadline to amend House
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
Rules by majority vote contained in rule
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
65 that uh rules may be amended by
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
majority vote on on the first section
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
follow session following January 6th um
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
that might be a way to do that that
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
would keep the deadlines clean for the
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
clerk and also recognize that we are in
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
an emergency
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
situation so um that would be my
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation Mr chairman I would just
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
state that uh I appreciate
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
representative Weber uh recognizing that
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
I would like to try to keep this as
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
clean as possible um and and I I think
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
that the suggestion that she's making um
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh in in terms of of adding that to the
 
00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
um rule amendment to be adopted later
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
might be a better proposition I'll hold
 
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
off on it till then then thank you uh
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
questioning no I'm satisfied with this
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
conversation The Exchange that just had
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
with the clerk and with representative
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
Weber that will deal with the concerns
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%
that represented Weber has which I I
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
share um in another portion of the
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
amendment so I'm ready to move on this
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
and and support
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
it uh I can't see any of the other uh
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
members do uh anybody else have their
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
hand up Paul I
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
can't um no sir is there any further
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
discussion uh yeah I've had my hand up
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I I yeah okay I'm sorry I
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
can't I can't see everybody on my screen
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
so I don't know who does and doesn't yep
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
so go ahead yeah
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'll I Echo the the
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
concerns about the January 15th deadline
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
um I air on the side given the current
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
situation of giving um whoever the
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
speaker ends up being a little bit more
 
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
latitude with the scheduling and and
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
airing on the side of flexibility with
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
that and i' you know I'd be in favor of
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
changing that January 15th to you know
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
just making it like January 30th or
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
whatever at the end of the month um just
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
so that the the new speaker doesn't find
 
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
thems in a scramble against a
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
deadline um you know to to get a rule
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
change made dealing with something that
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
that comes up in the next week or two um
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
it you know I I I know there's been some
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
public discussion um again that I
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
haven't been part of you know there
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
there's been uh a lot of discourse about
 
00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
how we're going to do our our
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions and all of that and
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
I I'm very cognizant that it it is going
 
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
to be a challenge um to to come up with
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
something and make all the logistical
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
arrangements and I you know
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
I the the deadlines are kind of cramped
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
and they always are that's just the way
 
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
we do business but the the January 15th
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
for the the house rules um yeah that
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
that bothers me i' I'd prefer to give
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
the speaker a little bit more
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility and just bump that to the
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
end of the month or as representative
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
Weber had suggested um have another
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
section drafted somewhere that that
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
gives a little bit more line item
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
date I think uh personally if we're
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
going to amend this and change it I
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
would rather see a u a finite date uh as
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
was just suggested maybe January
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
get too complicated with this so
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
if Mr Speaker representative rice and
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative Weber had their hands up
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
representative rice thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
so my question
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
is this is the only opportunity we would
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
have to amend this if we found that
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
going forward we were running into time
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
time issues we couldn't change this
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
later on
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
did that make any
 
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
sense if if I may answer that um thank
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
you representative rice so
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
um it's it's kind of a two-fold question
 
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
because the um the amendment that you'll
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
be discussing later um the emergency
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
rule Amendment uh does have a provision
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
in there where the speaker has the
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
authority to move um some of the dates
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
around uh with in discussion with the
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
majority and minority leaders
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
um the the session regard the section
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
regarding House Rules by majority vote
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
um we have typically tied that to and it
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
typically has not been a session day
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's usually a Thursday or Friday
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
sometime in the middle of the month um
 
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
and it and and and specifically we we um
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
the the more important day in that well
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
for me anyway is is that that last day
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
to introduce house bills as well because
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
uh by by changing that to the Third 30th
 
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
that leaves us um sort of at a a a
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
little bit of a problem in in getting
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
all bills to committees in in time and
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
um allows for greater chances of of
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
endless redrafts that we're very
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about um so uh you know that
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's why that those two dates have
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
typically been assigned
 
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
together if I may follow up further
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
question that that that is my concern I
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
don't want us to keep pushing stuff out
 
00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
and end up bogg down and in a crunch and
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
concern representative Weber has her
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
hand up Mr chair representative Weber uh
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um what I would
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
propose to do which I think does not
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
actually uh extend things too far but uh
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair my concern is if we did not
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
have another meeting in January there's
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
there good reasons that we might not
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
want to have a new another meeting in
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
January if we have a date certain for
 
00:37:09.069 --> 00:37:09.079 align:start position:0%
that the opportunity is lost so what I
 
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
would suggest doing is when we get to
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment to house rules that deals
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
with rues 67 emergency rules for covid
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic I would suggest that at that
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
point we add section F that would read
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
not withstanding the provisions of rule
 
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
65 the deadline for amending house rules
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
shall be extended to the next session
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
after the January 6th session so there's
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
only one session more that they can be
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
raised at and that would preserve our
 
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.470 align:start position:0%
raised at and that would preserve our
normal

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
normal
 
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
procedure uh and whenever the next
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
session is that would be the last
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity so you're not extending
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
things out um you know on on beyond that
 
00:37:59.309 --> 00:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
it's just that there I want to preserve
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
one specific protected opportunity for
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
our members to have a chance to
 
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
challenge house rules should they feel
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
they needed to do
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
you I don't see any other hands up Mr
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
Speaker okay
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
um motion is to adopt
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%

page okay Mr chair this is um the
 
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to house rule 49 um and and
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
just to be clear this amendment was one
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
that was um adopted Last by
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
enum it was adopted uh by Voice vote on
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house this was actually
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
something that was proposed by myself
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
and our um uh house committee Services
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
team um and because of the the the the
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
way we adopted rules on December 2nd
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
this um Amendment uh unfortunately um
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
went by the way in that so uh this
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
brings that back and it has to do
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
specifically specifically um which
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
extends deadlines of study committees
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
Beyond November first of the second year
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
um and uh which technically is is both a
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
violation of rules and statutes so that
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
is why we asked um two years ago to to
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
in okay is there any discussion on this
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%

following the January 6th session but I
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%

that all right well we have a motion
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
right now in front of us uh is there any
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
discussion and I will say that we
 
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh try and keep keep things as simple as
 
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
possible here if we want to discuss that
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
point so um the the motion at the at the
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
moment is to amend the amendment um
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
right which by the way we can do in this
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
committee on these things when we're on
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
the floor we don't amend amendments but
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
um we can do that in this committee to
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
to to clarify things so
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%

00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:01.559 align:start position:0%
representative Weber's hand is up Mr
 
00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:03.559 align:start position:0%
chair yes go ahead representative Weber
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
I I just thought it would be cleaner and
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
simpler for everybody if all of the
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
emergency rules were adopted as as one
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
package and if if if the committee is um
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay with this with this one small
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Osborne has his
 
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
hand up Mr chair okay go ahead
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:34.799 align:start position:0%
oh you're muted
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative sorry sorry um so in
 
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
section c there it talks about uh being
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
able to uh alter the deadlines in an
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
effort to thwart uh the
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um so do we really need uh
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
another um section here um and then
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
secondly should it read uh the deadline
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
for amending House Rules by simple
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
majority shall be extended
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber I think I think
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
that that is the intention there
 
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.309 align:start position:0%
that that is the intention there
correct

00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
um for amending the the deadline for
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
amending House Rules by a majority vote
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
by a simple majority by a majority vote
 
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would see that as a friendly
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I would be glad to include
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
if my second who is representative
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:48.750 align:start position:0%
 
agree

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
okay does anybody have any discussion
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
on the amendment to the amendment
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
I I would just note a question yeah I
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
would just note that I believe the
 
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:04.839 align:start position:0%
language in this is has a slight change
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
from what it was previously and relative
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
to the um discussions with a majority
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
and minority leader and public health
 
00:51:14.829 --> 00:51:14.839 align:start position:0%
officials but um I'm comfortable I mean
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
change so the motion before us Mr chair
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
is to adopt representative Weber's uh
 
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:28.799 align:start position:0%
new f into the amendment and then we
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
would vote on the amendment

representative John Graham Hillsboro 7
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
which is the town of Bedford myself and
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh John cluder the representative from
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
Claremont propose this relatively minor
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
change to house R 37 in order to
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
facilitate work in the second year of
 
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
the session as you all know the governor
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
proposes the 10-year Transportation plan
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
not on the 15th of January in even
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
numbered years when he does that we then
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
have to go to the rules committee to get
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
approval for for uh late Drafting and
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
introduction of a bill um by putting
 
00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
this into the same category as we do for
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
the budget and the capital budget we
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
would preclude that additional step but
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
still be able to uh work with the clerk
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
and with u edmin Ser services to get um
 
00:55:52.589 --> 00:55:52.599 align:start position:0%
everything done in a timely manner so
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
that we could look at the bill before
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
having the second year crossover date
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
Loom before us as we work on the P plan
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
it puts it into the same category as I
 
00:56:05.309 --> 00:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
said as the general budget and the
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
capital budget um but just in the second
 
00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
year so I would ask that the committee
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
approve this relatively minor change to
 
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
to make one comment to my good friend
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
and colleague
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative uh Kim rice to say how it
 
00:58:53.789 --> 00:58:53.799 align:start position:0%

that each day she's better and better
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and I know many people share that
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
view um in terms of this amendment uh to
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
house rule
 
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.990 align:start position:0%
house rule
two

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
um I am and my colleagues are a
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
very have a very high degree of
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
commitment both to process um in the
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives and respect for
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the House of
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
Representatives I believe that this
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to the rule helps to make
 
00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
clear how important the speaker is to
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
determining how we are able to conduct
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
business both amongst the members the
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
staff and the public and although it
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
certainly applies specifically to the
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
current circumstances that we find
 
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves in I believe it also is
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
something that applies generally and
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
reinforces the importance of the speaker
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
in how we as a house a very large body
 
01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
functions and I would ask that you
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
I believe Representative Steve Smith has
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
a uh motion you have do you have um yeah

know I'm a specificity kind of guy and
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh the speaker shall so that's crystal
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
clear that the state house so I'm
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
assuming that means the entire complex
 
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
is a welcoming inclusive environment for
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
the members staff and members of the
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
public in attendance so I guess I want
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
to know what that looks like in real
 
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
life so if a member of the cleaning
 
01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
staff is not welcoming somehow then the
 
01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:21.559 align:start position:0%
speaker is the one who gets involved in
 
01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary action or the labor
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
dispute so I I agree agree with the the
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
idea here but I don't think it's
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
something that can actually
 
01:01:32.829 --> 01:01:32.839 align:start position:0%
work uh representative rce I can see
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
your hand up thank you Mr Speaker so my
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
question is would this open up um the
 
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
possibility of litigation against the
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
speaker if someone were to to follow I
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
mean we have all that construction what
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
if they left something out I just see a
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
lot of different variables and I think
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
this um could could set the speaker up
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
for some some bad
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
things uh representative questionin I
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
think you had your hand up yeah I I I
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
think that this is a again consistent
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
with what representative Smith said I
 
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
just think this is a matter in the one
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
first instance of respecting the speaker
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
and acknowledging that the powers
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
inherent with the position include being
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for the protection of health
 
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
and safety of members uh staff and
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
members of the public um and I think
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's an appropriate addition to the
 
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.390 align:start position:0%
it's an appropriate addition to the
house

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
rules I trust the speaker whomever it
 
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.470 align:start position:0%
rules I trust the speaker whomever it
would

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
be and I want to make clear it's not
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
going to be the and quite frankly it's
 
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
because the speaker needs to be
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
responsible it's not enough to be you
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
know a chief of staff or someone else
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately um you know ultimately it's
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
the speaker's responsibility and we know
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
the keyword is insure it doesn't mean
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
that he has to or she has to do it uh
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
you know be micromanaging things it's
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
just part of the overall responsibility
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
ities that a speaker
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
has further
 
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
discussion if not I guess I I just want
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
to say a couple of
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
things I would hope and pray that any
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
speaker of either party would do this
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
automatically that we shouldn't have to
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
have an in house
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
roles and uh I
 
01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
I I agree with it 100% that it is the
 
01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
the speaker's responsibility to do the
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
best here she can to make sure that you
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
know the health and the safety of of
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
everybody in the building is a a top
 
01:03:34.359 --> 01:03:36.510 align:start position:0%
everybody in the building is a a top
priority

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
priority
 
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
and I I just don't believe that he or
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
she has to
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
be kind of I I would just say told that
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
in in a uh in a uh rule I I would hope
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
that should be
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
automatic and uh I hope that never
 
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
changes if there's no further discussion
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
clerk call
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%

chance to put it all together so that's
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%

repres um thank you very much um Mr
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
chair um before um I continue I do have
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
one question if we were in
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
person um as someone who presented um an
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
amendment um I might have had an
 
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
respond and um while I signaled raay
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
hand um I guess that didn't count and I
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
just want to say as to the
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
last um Amendment there was nothing in
 
01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:00.549 align:start position:0%
last um Amendment there was nothing in
that

01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh that assumed that the
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
speaker would not want to do this the
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
language in that amendment was to ensure
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
that no one would challenge the speaker
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
who exercised his or her authority
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
to keep the environment safe and that I
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
would have added if I had been allowed
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
to say anything thing as to amending uh
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
house rule 30 um M uh we know that we
 
01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:41.730 align:start position:0%
house rule 30 um M uh we know that we
have

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:41.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:50.829 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
um am I on again you are I thank you um
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
um this adds just it shall be the
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
further duty of the committee on
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration to review the
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
existing statutory and study committees
 
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all committees are still
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
necessary for the work of the house we
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
have had over the years any number of um
 
01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
cumbersome structures um relating to our
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
love of creating statutory and study
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
committees and then having them continue
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
to exist long after they are
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
useful this is a way to give one of our
 
01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.990 align:start position:0%
useful this is a way to give one of our
statutory

01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
committees um clear authority to review
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
the other statutory and study committees
 
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
and to to ensure that their time has not
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
come and gone um we believe that this is
 
01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
a way to increase the
 
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
efficiency and um the
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh the efficiency of of the house and um
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
to increase the relevance of the work
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
that we ask members of the house to do
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
and I would urge you to increase the
 
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
powers of the committee on legislative
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
language um Mr chair representative
 
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
Weber has her hand up for question uh
 
01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
well first let's uh see if we can get a
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
motion and then we can go into the
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
discussion Mr Sher if I may I I think um
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
to address representative Smith's uh
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
concern from before uh typically um you
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
would you would normally have questions
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
um of the of the proposer uh and then um
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
you can you can certainly have your
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
motion following
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
that um and I apologize to uh
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh what I'm seeing
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
on my screen is just a still picture of
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
you and uh if I is is not my intention
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to deny anybody uh to speak
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
to their Amendment and not takes
 
01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
questions so I apologize for that thank
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and there's no need to
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't have any choice I
 
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
believe in what you see and the picture
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
is probably better than what I look like
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
anyway it's a wonderful picture
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh so are there uh questions for uh yes
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
represent Weber has her hand up uh
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair I had my hand up to make a
 
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
motion if that was
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
acceptable well yes yeah I would move
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
that we accept this language and I would
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
like to speak to my motion okay
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
second um thank you I I just having been
 
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
involved in several rounds when we had
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
to file
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and had a five or 10e
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
buildup of committees some of which were
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
useful some of which were not useful it
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
just seems to me to be very helpful if
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration as a
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee has the authority to go ahead
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
and take a look at these at whatever
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
time they think is is most um is most
 
01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
time they think is is most um is most
useful

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
useful
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
um and by putting it in here they can do
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing that they do with
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
other issues they can send it to a
 
01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee it can either go back to
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
allege admin or come straight to the
 
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
house but I think it's a very efficient
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
way and and saves us a couple of steps
 
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe focuses the mind a little more
 
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
on making sure that we police all of
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
those committees and and get rid of the
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
ones we're not needing in a timely
 
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
fashion because it's a huge drain on
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
staff time and uh it's a huge um it's it
 
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
it will be a huge uh issue for your
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
Deputy speaker in terms of appointing
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
people to committees which may then not
 
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
meet so um uh I'm I'm pleased to make a
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
motion to
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
accept well when I looked at this
 
01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
representative Weber the other day um I
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
we were looking at so much stuff I
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
didn't really have a chance to really
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
look at it closely um having done those
 
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
appointments for twice um even both in
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
the majority and the minority it is a
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
daunting task because especially we had
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
such a hard time finding people to fill
 
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.550 align:start position:0%
such a hard time finding people to fill
the

01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
seats um I actually like this uh if I
 
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:43.990 align:start position:0%
seats um I actually like this uh if I
remember

01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
correctly uh under speaker narelli I
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
think she did something like this a
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
number of years ago that they took a
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
close look at the um statutory and
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
commissions and cut some of them down
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
that weren't meeting or
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so I I I think this is a um
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
not a bad idea to uh to add on to the
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
policies and it could cut down quite a
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
bit on on as you say staff time and
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
having committees that don't meet except
 
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
for once every four or five years and uh
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
really don't accomplish anything
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative rice has her hand up Mr
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative rice yes thank you very
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
much so my my only question is um I'm
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
having a hard time reading it because
 
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
it's small but would this go in front of
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
um like would there be public testimony
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
people be able to testify against like
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
them wanting to get rid of a certain
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee or is this just going to be
 
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
like a unilateral they can do what they
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
want without input from the public
 
01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
I would hope representative Smith and
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to clarify this that
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
if we're going to put this in there that
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
it would be the duty of the legislative
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
Administration committee to bring uh a
 
01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
particular commission or statutory
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
committee up and actually bring people
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
in to uh testify in favor or against
 
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
that so that uh there could be
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
clarification as to what the committee
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
does when it meets how often it meets
 
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
meets if it meets and what any of the uh
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
reports that were supposed to be
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
submitted usually in November to the uh
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
speaker the Senate President and the
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
governor so um and I I will refer to the
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
clerk that if does this do what um I
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
believe it should do so so um Mr chair
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
to answer your question um any any type
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
of change would require legislation uh
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
so so this
 
01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
this would empower the committee um to
 
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
do their work and bring in legislation
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh to to get rid of or you know enhance
 
01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
or elongate the the the time of the
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee or
 
01:14:14.669 --> 01:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
commission okay
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
now we can do that now anyways can't
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
we yes um to to an extent uh this you
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
know by having by having this in here uh
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
it does sort of empower the committee to
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
to take that uh on as as as a task um
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
you know you referenced uh speaker
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
narelli back in in
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
2010 uh we did have uh we actually
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
called it the committee on committees um
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it was a creation by legislation uh
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
that looked at all of these these
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
various things and made several
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations um and and filed
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
legislation uh based on their work uh to
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
to get rid of some of these things and
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
also to um reorganize and that sort of
 
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
thing as
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
well representative um Cushing has his
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
hand up and representative Weber did as
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
well uh representative Cushing yeah I
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
when I looked at this I kind of think of
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
it the same way um we assigned to the
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
policy committee that had jurisdiction
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
over a particular area to take a look at
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
the performance audits that the LBA did
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
so that um you know someone had the
 
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility to take a look at uh you
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
know a specific report and perhaps
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation perhaps not but at
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
least have someone somebody who's who's
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for acting upon this
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
work that was done I think it makes
 
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
sense just to have legislative
 
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
Administration to have as its
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to you know be alert find
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
out if there are any you know Phantom
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
study Phantom study committees out there
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
things that aren't functioning that
 
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
aren't working that we just need to we
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
should just be able to clean it up as
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to having every five years uh
 
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
commit appoint and pass the statute to
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
have a new other Committee of committees
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
obsolete representative Weber has minut
 
01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
first okay where sener Weber and I would
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
I would just add that if if we put the
 
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
permission in here then the committee on
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
committees could have a subcommittee a
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
standing subcommittee if they wanted or
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc committee which then would all
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
to in order to meet because it's an
 
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
official house committee anytime that
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee met there would have to be
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
notice and uh uh public attendance uh to
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
to um with respect to their discussions
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
a and I just think it focuses the mind
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
to have it in there as a duty um and and
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
allows some leeway for uh the way to
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
deal with it as the clerk says any
 
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
ultimate resolution has to come by
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
Statute so um it would all have the
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
proper um public input but it might be
 
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
useful to be able to get things resolved
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat informally first and then draft
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
a statute afterwards that is an Omnibus
 
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
statute that takes care of all the
 
01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
things that have been resolved thank
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Tim Smith has his
 
01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
hand up all right representative Tim
 
01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:24.990 align:start position:0%
hand up all right representative Tim
Smith

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um I I just want to say that
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
as somebody who has been appointed to a
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
number of these Phantom committies over
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
the years um that had membership but no
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
business uh didn't didn't meet didn't
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
produce reports at least not that anyone
 
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
ever made me aware of um you know I I
 
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
asked the question several times over my
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
my tenure in the legislature like why am
 
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
I on this weird committee that doesn't
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
do anything in some cases I didn't even
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
find out out for months um that I was
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
appointed to this committee uh
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
specifically because it's it's a phantom
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
committee left over from you know
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
legislation seven years ago that no
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
longer serves a function um and no one
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
could tell me um what I was supposed to
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
do or like who had the responsibility to
 
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
review that situation um and I I really
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
strongly support the idea of you know
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
adding this line item to the
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of legis ative
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
Administration as being the the people
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
with that responsibility so that um you
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
know a member of the the house who finds
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
thems in a similar situation um at least
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
has a particular place to go um to to
 
01:18:43.229 --> 01:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
provide feedback or seek information
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
rather than just blindly send emails to
 
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate staff and hope that
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
somebody can give them something um I I
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
think that this would be an extremely
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
posit POS clarifying measure if nothing
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
else um for for members of our body who
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
who finds confused wondering why they're
 
01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
they're on the the committee to stutter
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know the committee to stutter
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
study water filtration patterns in 2012
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
and it it's now going to be 2021 and
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
that further
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
discussion Representative Steve Smith
 
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
has his hand up Representative Steve
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair um so you
 
01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
probably won't be surprised to here I
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't disagree more I I don't think
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
legi admin can do this uh a few years
 
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
ago I was appointed to a couple of
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
commissions and actually was surprised
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
to find out that by Statute I was the
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
chair of one and I'd never heard of
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
either of them so I looked them up and I
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
was able to find a little information on
 
01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
one and zero on the other looking at the
 
01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
general Court website there had never
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
been any meetings there had never been
 
01:19:58.760 --> 01:19:59.629 align:start position:0%
been any meetings there had never been
any

01:19:59.629 --> 01:19:59.639 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
reports so I filed bills to repeal both
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
of them and one case crickets and the
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
other one my phone started ringing uh
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
staff from the Department of Safety the
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Motor Transport
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
Association uh whoever it is that's in
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
charge of the taxes turns out this
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
commission was actually meeting was
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
doing good work and it was just
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
invisible for some reason it was a
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
pretty arduous process to figure out
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
that one of them the duties some of the
 
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
duties should be transferred to that and
 
01:20:32.669 --> 01:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
it requires a high level of subject
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
matter expertise I would vote against
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
this and direct ask whoever the next
 
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
speaker is to make this the job of each
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
committee chair rather than one house
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
committee who may never have heard of
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
either of them and not know who the
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
specific contacts were I mean uh just
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
think if my phone had not rang and we
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
ended up repealing a commission that was
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
doing good work was just having
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
reporting problems and to fix that it
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
required um a slight tweak to the
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
membership to allow getting it on their
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
meetings onto the house calendar um so I
 
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
totally agree with doing this and Mr
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
chair you've heard me shake the cage
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
before that this is something we should
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
be focusing on but I disagree that the
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
committee on legislative Administration
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
is the committee to do
 
01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is

one pertains to alcohol is there an
 
01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:55.719 align:start position:0%
order in which you'd like to
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
proceed um I am uh at your uh Mercy um
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
Mr clerk you and the chair are in charge
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
and I would just like to mention yet
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
again that it would have been nice if I
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
could have answered some of the
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
questions on the
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
previous um
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh proposal I did press raise hand
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
but I guess raising hand for me doesn't
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
count but you're in charge so you tell
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
me how to
 
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:29.639 align:start position:0%
proceed so as I was trying to explain
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
earlier representative Smith and this is
 
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
U normally what happens in rules is a
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
member makes their proposal uh and
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
members ask their questions of the the
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
proposer uh and at that point um when
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
the when a uh a motion is made
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
essentially the the committee is in exec
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
session and does not take input um thank
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
you very
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%

01:23:58.270 --> 01:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
if if you have a preference uh that no
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%

01:24:02.669 --> 01:24:02.679 align:start position:0%

01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
then we'll we'll we'll go alphabetical
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
just because so let's do
 
01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:11.420 align:start position:0%
that okay we'll start with the alcohol
 
01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
that okay we'll start with the alcohol

01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much um Mr chair um
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
the only change in uh house rule 63 is
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
to add a sentence at the
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
end sometimes it is true that we um are
 
01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:55.639 align:start position:0%
fighting the last war
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
and we figure out what to do based on
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
what happened before not knowing if it's
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to happen again uh and there's no
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
question that this falls into that
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
category up until um recent
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
events uh we would not have thought
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
there was any need to clarify what
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate decorum would be in the
 
01:25:26.109 --> 01:25:26.119 align:start position:0%
house of repres Representatives but now
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
we all know that it is necessary to be
 
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
specific about certain behaviors that
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
are clearly not in the do not respect
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
the safety or the decorum or appropriate
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
behavior of members of the house and
 
01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
because of that perhaps it's belt and
 
01:25:50.109 --> 01:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
suspenders perhaps not but um I would
 
01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
propose that we add this language so
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
that people would not be
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
confused and think that perhaps it would
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to behave in this way
 
01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
that among other things damages the
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
you repes representative sh uh yeah
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Sher I thank you Mr
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker I would move the
 
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
acceptance of this
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Weber seconds
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
if I could just speak briefly to my
 
01:26:31.109 --> 01:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
motion Mr Speaker you may thank you Mr
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker in the last session of the house
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
one of the saddest
 
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
days that we met was the day that we
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
found that a dozen cans of empty beer
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
were found behind one particular section
 
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
of the house and I learned that this
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't the first occasion that members
 
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
had Drank In The House
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
chamber uh this was at least the second
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
second time they had done something so
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
soft moric as to drink alcohol in the
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
chamber of the New Hampshire House of
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
Representatives Mr chair Mr chairman
 
01:27:05.199 --> 01:27:05.950 align:start position:0%
Representatives Mr chair Mr chairman
like

01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
yourself um I have great respect for the
 
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
institution of the New Hampshire house
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
and especially the chamber in which we
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
meet no matter where the legislature
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
meets that is our house chamber and to
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
have members of the New Hampshire house
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
act with less maturity than a fourth
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
grade class visiting the state house
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
just simply amazes me if they think when
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
their constituents elect them to serve
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the house chamber it's the equivalent
 
01:27:42.430 --> 01:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
of going to a Red Sox game they're in
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
the wrong body and I would urge the
 
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
members of this committee to pass this
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
amendment so that never again will
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
anybody disgrace in New Hampshire house
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
by thinking they can drink alcohol in
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
the body in the people's house where
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
we're passing legislation on behalf of
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
the people we serve thank you Mr
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
discussion see any hands up Mr chair oh
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative Osborne has raised his
 
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
hand represent
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
re really uh I really don't want to get
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
dragged into the gutter
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
today and I I can't uh I can't believe
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
that we're still pretending to be
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
outraged over this
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
situation uh we no no member meant
 
01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.709 align:start position:0%
situation uh we no no member meant
anything

01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
disrespectful on that
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
day uh as far as I
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
know members believed that during
 
01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
lunchtime that that building we were in
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
ceased to be the house and instead
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
became a Cafeteria Restaurant whatever
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
you want to call it um you know members
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
had food on the floor uh that they were
 
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
eating which we don't normally do in the
 
01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:16.510 align:start position:0%
eating which we don't normally do in the
house

01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
chamber number of behaviors occurring
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
during that time period that we do not
 
01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:27.639 align:start position:0%
do in the house chamber this rule is
 
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and uh I think it is uh it
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
is best for all of us to be able to get
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
through these times that we are in if we
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
can let this go and uh and take care of
 
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
the people's
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
Privilege I will allow a little bit of
 
01:29:53.159 --> 01:29:54.669 align:start position:0%
Privilege I will allow a little bit of
attitude

01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
attitude
 
01:29:57.149 --> 01:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
I mean I only asked Mr chair because the
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
member had just said it's too late for
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
people to be to still pretend to be
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
outraged there's no pretense in my
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
outrage at what happened that day it's
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
not pretend it's not trying to be
 
01:30:11.709 --> 01:30:11.719 align:start position:0%
political I'm not attacking any
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
political party or any two individuals
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
who I think were taking part in that the
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
fact that no matter what we may be
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
having our lunches there because of the
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
Health crisis but to for someone to come
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
in and bring alcohol in uh denigrates
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
the body in which I am so proud like you
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
01:30:38.669 --> 01:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
Osborne all may I respond I I I will
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
respond to apologize for
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I get
 
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
um insinuating a a motive or putting
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
putting thoughts in uh the
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative's head that uh it's not
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
my place to put there I thank the
 
01:30:57.629 --> 01:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
member representative Tim Smith has his
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
hand up Sir uh representative Tim
 
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
Smith um thank you um I i' just say that
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment and others like it um I
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
see this as empowering the Speaker of
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
the House you know we um we find
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
ourselves in situations sometimes where
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
somebody does something
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
and there's no
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
there's no clear Authority for them to
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
be held accountable for it um and you
 
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
know I I'll I'll say this as someone who
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
has sat on a legislative disciplinary
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
hearing um you know in recent memory the
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
the question comes up sometimes it's
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
like okay this person did something that
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know denigrated the house or or was
 
01:31:49.709 --> 01:31:49.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise unacceptable um but was it
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
actually against the rules and if not we
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
don't have any Authority or the speaker
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even have any authority to you
 
01:31:59.109 --> 01:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
know to do to discipline them or hold
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
them accountable or or even really just
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
have a a Stern sort of a discussion with
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
them asking them to you know cut the
 
01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
nonsense um this would provide a grounds
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
for such action you know if if we find
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
somebody uh drinking alcohol or or using
 
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
illegal substances or something in the
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
chamber um as it stands right now it
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
would be very difficult for for for the
 
01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
house leadership to to Really find a
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
justification um to even just ask that
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
member to stop um and I I I see this
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
entirely as empowering the speaker of
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
the house and I I share the sentiments
 
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
of Representative shirtliff um and
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Smith who presented it I
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
think it's unfortunate that this is uh
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
necessary but it is reactionary and it
 
01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
is necessary um so that's all I would
 
01:32:51.639 --> 01:32:54.830 align:start position:0%
is necessary um so that's all I would
add

01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative Osborne's hands up as his
 
01:32:59.950 --> 01:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve Smiths okay uh
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative Osborne oh he's waving

01:33:04.199 --> 01:33:06.109 align:start position:0%
off oh he's waving off Representative
Steve

01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
Steve
 
01:33:08.910 --> 01:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair and this may
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
make you smile a little but I remember
 
01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:15.560 align:start position:0%
the Representative Steve Smith of say I
 
01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
don't know six to eight years
 
01:33:20.669 --> 01:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
ago you'll know that I'm an authority
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
that the speaker staff can they've got a
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
lot things they can do to troublemakers
 
01:33:27.149 --> 01:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
and I experienced some of that I'm
 
01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
pretty sure I experienced some of it
 
01:33:32.109 --> 01:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
from you as well Mr chair and I have
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
full confidence in the speaker's office
 
01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
to have the ability to deal with
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
situations as they arise even if they're
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
not covered in a specific house rule but
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's Behavior that's um
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
clearly well I don't I don't want to
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
beat myself up too bad since I was the
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
Troublemaker back then but I have full
 
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
full confidence in your ability to deal
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
with situations that come up without
 
01:33:56.159 --> 01:34:00.070 align:start position:0%
with situations that come up without
this

01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
rule I I I agree
 
01:34:06.669 --> 01:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
um having
 
01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
been involved in the speaker's office
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
for four
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
years I can't count the number of
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances where a member was brought
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
in because of some kind of activity or
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
something of that nature that they they
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
partic participated in and um they were
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
brought in and and
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
and talked to uh and and I'm sure uh
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
speaker Sheriff you know had to do the
 
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
same thing so I
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
I I agree that I I really believe that
 
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:49.400 align:start position:0%
the speaker has the ability to bring
 
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
anybody in at any time and speak to them
 
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:56.360 align:start position:0%
about an activity that they deem to be
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
unsatisfactory and I I don't think we
 
01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
need to continually put these type of
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
things into the rules so I will be
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
this there's no further further
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
questions or I'm it discussion
 
01:35:15.149 --> 01:35:15.159 align:start position:0%
representative Cushing has his hand
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative King yeah you know I I
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
think it's important not just that the
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
the speaker uh on a Case by case BAS
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
can call someone out and and and tell
 
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
them that drinking in the in the house
 
01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
Chambers is is not a good idea I think
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's important that the house itself as
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
a body that we take a position and put
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
it in our rules that nobody should be
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
drinking or using illegal substance in
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
rep's hall or in in the chamber I think
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of the the kind of the
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
respect and honor of the house itself
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
that we take this position and I will be
 
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
supporting it
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
I just got to
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
um to say that um and I I don't know of
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
this but um I don't know the whole
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances of what happened at
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
UNH uh I wasn't involved to them I
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
didn't see anything happen um so I'm not
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
going to comment on what happened or
 
01:36:18.910 --> 01:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
didn't happen but having been a member
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
of the House for 30 years I don't ever
 
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.830 align:start position:0%
of the House for 30 years I don't ever
remember

01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
and I could be wrong and just not been
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
informed of it of any of these type of
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances ha happening in our house
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
chamber at the state
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
house and I'm not sure we need
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
to put different kind of rules in place
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
for one
 
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
incident or two incidences that happen
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
in unusual
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances so uh again I I respect
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
what you're saying as far as you don't
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
want it happening I don't want it
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
happening either but I do believe the
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
speaker already has that authority to to
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh attend to it if something does
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary there be no
 
01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessary there be no
further

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:17.490 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:37:17.490 --> 01:37:19.390 align:start position:0%
further

[Music]
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
um unless representative marjerie Smith
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
has something as we can't see her hand
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
so I I I want to make sure that uh if
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
she uh wishes to uh say something that
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
she has the ability to do that even
 
01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
though we can't see her
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
hand if that be the case then the clerk
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
will call her
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
all the motion is uh to accept the
 
01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Packard
 
01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:50.440 align:start position:0%

four give me just a moment I will pull
 
01:38:23.709 --> 01:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:23.719 --> 01:38:57.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:04.920 align:start position:0%

screen uh representative Smith majie
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much Mr chairman
 
01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
with three Smiths on the call it's a
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
little complicated isn't it only one
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
Packard though
 
01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
um when in the 2006
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
election um the Earth Shook and uh
 
01:39:32.589 --> 01:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
Democrats uh were in the majority in the
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
house um everyone including all the
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
Democrats were quite
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
shocked and we came in with nobody
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
having had any training or experience um
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of being chairs or vice chairs
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
or anything like that but we did have
 
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.990 align:start position:0%
or anything like that but we did have
rules

01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
and when the Democrats achieved the
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
majority we respected to the to the
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
greatest possible extent the rules that
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
existed in the house and the rules that
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
existed in the house included
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
language that um limited
 
01:40:16.719 --> 01:40:18.589 align:start position:0%
language that um limited
uh

01:40:18.589 --> 01:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:24.109 --> 01:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
weapons in the chamber that was the long
 
01:40:24.119 --> 01:40:26.790 align:start position:0%
weapons in the chamber that was the long
established

01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
Republican position and it was a
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
position that
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
continued until there was a slight break
 
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
in the action and then continued
 
01:40:42.189 --> 01:40:42.199 align:start position:0%
again and now we're at a point when this
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
language is not in the rules as they
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
were adopted a few weeks ago at the
 
01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
field in front of um the whittimore
 
01:40:52.599 --> 01:40:53.990 align:start position:0%
field in front of um the whittimore
center

01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:40:57.390 --> 01:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
this proposes to bring back into the
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
rules language which has long been
 
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
included um
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
under overwhelmingly Republican and
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes three times
 
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
Democratic um uh control and it is I
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
Believe essential to the well being of
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
the house and to the safety of the
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
members of the house and uh it is
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
responsible and it is historically
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
consistent with what the house has done
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
over the years and I ask that
 
01:41:48.589 --> 01:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
you um accept this amendment to house
 
01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:54.770 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:57.350 align:start position:0%

01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
chair Mr chair I uh speak in opposition
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
to the motion not to accept this

01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
I remember when we first voted in the
 
01:43:31.149 --> 01:43:31.159 align:start position:0%
house to allow firearms and I had we had
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
a dear old state representative from
 
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester whose name I won't mention
 
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
but uh he was not in the best of health
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
and I remember him coming over to tell
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
me don't worry Steve if anything happens
 
01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
in the house I've got my gun with me
 
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
today and I thought to myself Mr chair
 
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
heaven forbid something should happen
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
because you never know who he might hit
 
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
when he starts firing that gun because
 
01:43:58.350 --> 01:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
of his ill
 
01:44:00.990 --> 01:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
health we know that many members of the
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
House carry weapons I don't know how
 
01:44:06.189 --> 01:44:06.199 align:start position:0%
many of them have gone had any training
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
whatsoever we've had incidents in the in
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
the in the legislature where house
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
members have dropped their weapons I sat
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
in a committee room next to a person who
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
whose weapon fell out of their shoulder
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
holster and bounced on the ground in the
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee um
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
we've had problems we had members in
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
another Committee just a couple years
 
01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:32.679 align:start position:0%
ago same thing uh her weapon fell out of
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
her purse um there is no training there
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
is no requirement and I always think Mr
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
chair that uh we are the House of
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
Representatives we're there to make the
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
laws for the people of New Hampshire but
 
01:44:49.589 --> 01:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
we also serve as a
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
classroom and I I worry about those
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
fourth grade ators in the visitors
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
Gallery they should not be in an
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
environment where anybody can be
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
carrying a a firearm including the
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
person sitting next to him in the
 
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
visitor center it just is not
 
01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate in the New Hampshire house
 
01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh we have an excellent security between
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
our Capitol Police our doorkeepers in
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State Police um I feel
 
01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
perfectly secure the New Hampshire house
 
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
chamber is not a place for firearms
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative Tim Smith is
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
next I
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
believe thank you Mr chairman um you
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
know i' I'd point out that as a as a
 
01:45:41.070 --> 01:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
society we identify there are certain
 
01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
places uh out in
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
society um
 
01:45:49.149 --> 01:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
where it's better for the public good to
 
01:45:49.159 --> 01:45:50.629 align:start position:0%
where it's better for the public good to
have

01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
facilities security
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
handle security Arrangements rather than
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
just leave it to you know individual
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
people to to carry a gun or whatever for
 
01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.390 align:start position:0%
people to to carry a gun or whatever for
personal

01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
personal
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
protection um jails courtrooms the White
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
House so on and so
 
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
on I think that the New Hampshire house
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know the legislative
 
01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
chamber um is correct in being one of
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
those places or has for a very long time
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
been correct in being one of those
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
places that
 
01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
that empowers and tasks uh the
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
facilities staff with the security
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
Arrangements rather than just leaving it
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
up to individuals and the reason we do
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
that I feel compelled to again remind
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
the members the reason we do that is not
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
because of some philosophical point or
 
01:46:48.189 --> 01:46:48.199 align:start position:0%
some ideological position on the Second
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment or anything like that it is
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
entirely a practical consider ation the
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
reason that the rule was originally put
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
into place back in the early
 
01:47:02.589 --> 01:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
1970s by Speaker of the House Marshall
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
cobbley was because a member of the
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
House brought a gun into the chamber and
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
threatened to shoot him because he was
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
the member was unhappy about their
 
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.189 align:start position:0%
the member was unhappy about their
seating

01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
seating
 
01:47:19.589 --> 01:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
assignment that's not my opinion or
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation it's the historical
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
record as as a matter of fact in the
 
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
late speaker koby's political Memoir
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
which I happen to have a copy of called
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
we ain't making sausage here he
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
dedicates an entire chapter chapter 37
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
entitled he's going to shoot you he
 
01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
dedicates that entire chapter to
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
describing the incident in detail and
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
the Mad scramble that took place after
 
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
the fact to try and find some Authority
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
in the rules or statute or some
 
01:47:55.709 --> 01:47:55.719 align:start position:0%
something to disarm this member in the
 
01:47:58.189 --> 01:47:58.199 align:start position:0%
house who was armed and threatening
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
violence against the speaker of the
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
house it strikes me as the height of
 
01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
irresponsibility that we would Prelude
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
this from the house rules and remove
 
01:48:10.239 --> 01:48:11.109 align:start position:0%
this from the house rules and remove
that

01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:14.669 --> 01:48:14.679 align:start position:0%
Authority um to respond to a similar
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
situation in kind in the unthinkable
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance that it were to happen
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
again and reminding everyone it's not a
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
philosophical point it has happened once
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
I I hope we don't find ourselves
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
regretting removing this section from
 
01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:35.390 align:start position:0%
regretting removing this section from
the

01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.430 --> 01:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
discussion Representative Steve Smith
 
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
has his hand up and
 
01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
represent uh Representative Steve Smith
 
01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd only point out
 
01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
that I don't know what time period that
 
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
happened but if that were to happen now
 
01:48:58.589 --> 01:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
there are a variety of felonies so that
 
01:49:01.629 --> 01:49:01.639 align:start position:0%
there actually is a statutory method of
 
01:49:04.510 --> 01:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with it if I would to say I'm
 
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
unhappy with my assignment pull out a
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
gun and threaten to shoot you about it
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
there's criminal menacing criminal
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
threatening I mean there are a variety
 
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
of things that can be used to deal with
 
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
it so um perhaps back in that time
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
period the only way to deal with it was
 
01:49:19.709 --> 01:49:19.719 align:start position:0%
a house rule but that's just not the
 
01:49:19.719 --> 01:49:21.709 align:start position:0%
a house rule but that's just not the
case

01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
Osborne yeah I just uh wanted to say
 
01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.669 align:start position:0%
Osborne yeah I just uh wanted to say
that

01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh I I wish we could uh come up with a
 
01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
rule that uh we could all agree on that
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
would not keep us in this situation of
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
flip-flopping every time that
 
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
the um you know the majority shifts um I
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's possible um you
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
know this obviously is not the way of
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
doing it um so I I hope someone comes up
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
someday uh further questions or
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Cushing has
 
01:50:07.950 --> 01:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
his hand
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
up okay R cushion just briefly I you
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
know I Echo the words uh
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
of former speaker sherff and Tim Smith
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um on about this
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
issue and I I remember I I knew Marshall
 
01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
Coby I remember he was the first Speaker
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
I ever met um and um the the words that
 
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
he spoke of in his in his book are
 
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
really are relevant to today um and the
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
there were existing back in the 70s
 
01:50:44.109 --> 01:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
those statutory requirements this is
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
about how we operate in the chamber and
 
01:50:49.229 --> 01:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
I think um this is an appropriate rule
 
01:50:58.030 --> 01:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
I wasn't going to say anything on this
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
but I I I I feel compelled I have to um
 
01:51:05.069 --> 01:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that
 
01:51:09.069 --> 01:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
um um former speaker shli probably had
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
the same things happen to him just in
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
the past week alone since the loss of
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
our uh colleague representative hinch
 
01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:19.910 align:start position:0%
our uh colleague representative hinch
speaker

01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
hinch I have had
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
two threatening emails sent to me over
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
different issues and I've only been here
 
01:51:32.069 --> 01:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
my acting speaker for what a week and a
 
01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
half now but I've had two violent active
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
emails sent to
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
me I
 
01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:43.910 align:start position:0%
me I
wish

01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
wish
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
that both
 
01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
sides our parties could
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
contain the absolute
 
01:51:55.229 --> 01:51:55.239 align:start position:0%
fanatics on both sides of our
 
01:51:55.239 --> 01:51:57.069 align:start position:0%
fanatics on both sides of our
parties

01:51:57.069 --> 01:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
parties
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh if anything it would make me want to
 
01:52:02.589 --> 01:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
start carrying a weapon at this point
 
01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
because I don't know who is going to
 
01:52:06.069 --> 01:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
come after me and how they're going to
 
01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
come after me so I
 
01:52:13.149 --> 01:52:13.159 align:start position:0%
I I I I I'm I'm concerned
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
about in many cases how we're moving
 
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
forward and I I for one will never ever
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
agree to deny a member the right to
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
protect himself or a person or a citizen
 
01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
of this state for that reason I I'm
 
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
might par you know Mr Speaker I I I
 
01:52:44.189 --> 01:52:44.199 align:start position:0%
stand with you and I condemn the kind of
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know threats and attacks that any of
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
us have to experience because of our
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
public service and I just want to I say
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
that and sometimes it's not about
 
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
members of our of either one of our
 
01:52:57.149 --> 01:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
parties that there were just forces out
 
01:52:59.550 --> 01:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
there who would not fit into any
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
particular party who do uh you know
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
promote violence um and are opposed to
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
civil discourse but I I I I I condemn
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
what happened to you I I I I I believe
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
you're right representative kushen um
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
they probably don't belong to any one of
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
the parties and uh uh but the fact that
 
01:53:25.629 --> 01:53:25.639 align:start position:0%
the matter is uh we're in a strange time
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
right now and
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
um I really um am concerned about you
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
know the safety of not only our house
 
01:53:39.790 --> 01:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
citizens there be no further discussion
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
if there no further
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
discussion clerk will call a role which
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
I believe is to not accept it if I'm
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%

01:53:54.589 --> 01:53:54.599 align:start position:0%

and I now present to
 
01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
you um an amendment to add rule
 
01:55:36.189 --> 01:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
67 um which acknowledges the reality of
 
01:55:39.149 --> 01:55:39.159 align:start position:0%
the world in which we live and
 
01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:43.639 align:start position:0%
acknowledges I hope that we would like
 
01:55:47.229 --> 01:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
to make life better for legislators
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
legislative officers and staff and
 
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
therefore this just proposed
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
sexual harassment training as determined
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:56:04.189 --> 01:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
speaker aimed at preventing sexual
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
harassment it's very simple there's
 
01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
nothing else in there but its importance
 
01:56:16.910 --> 01:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
is profound we have again and again um
 
01:56:22.589 --> 01:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
examples of uh sexual harassment perhaps
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
deliberate perhaps not
 
01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:28.149 align:start position:0%
deliberate perhaps not
deliberate

01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
deliberate
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
um and I would ask you to support adding
 
01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:44.430 align:start position:0%
um and I would ask you to support adding
this

01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.069 --> 01:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
motion M representative Cushing has his
 
01:56:55.390 --> 01:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
hand up question I move out to
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
pass to accept
 
01:57:00.990 --> 01:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
I represent
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
Weber is that correct
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
yes and if I might um I might speak yes
 
01:57:13.629 --> 01:57:13.639 align:start position:0%
we're open for discussion you know you
 
01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
know as we know unfortunately there is a
 
01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
history of uh sexual harassment that has
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
taken place
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
within the legislature itself I know
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
that you know several years ago perhaps
 
01:57:31.629 --> 01:57:31.639 align:start position:0%
a decade or more ago was an instance
 
01:57:35.790 --> 01:57:35.800 align:start position:0%
where a member of the staff was
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
subjected to unwanted sexual advances by
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
a legislator um that continued um there
 
01:57:48.030 --> 01:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
is just by definition an asymmetrical
 
01:57:50.510 --> 01:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
power relationship between a legislator
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
and a staff person um and sometimes um
 
01:57:58.830 --> 01:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
we need to we actually need to all work
 
01:58:02.069 --> 01:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
and to confront um this kind of sexual
 
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
harassment that is all too pervasive um
 
01:58:07.069 --> 01:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
in our society but as legislators we
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
should be setting the example we need to
 
01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
set the example on how we relate to each
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
other and how we relate to our staff and
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
how we relate to members of the public I
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
I will note that the case I ear referred
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
to resulted in a lawsuit that cost the
 
01:58:27.149 --> 01:58:27.159 align:start position:0%
legislature um in the state of New
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire substantial amount of money um
 
01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
and this is again the the requirement
 
01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
that there be sexual harassment
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
prevention training was in the rules uh
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
prior during the prior session I think
 
01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's a a good policy we all benefit from
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
amendment further discussion
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative Tim Smith has his hand up
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you um so I
 
01:59:03.629 --> 01:59:03.639 align:start position:0%
would just point out that when
 
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
the motion was made um last month on
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
organization day um that had the the net
 
01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:14.719 align:start position:0%
effect of removing this from the rules
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues raised uh was that
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
the previous language required inperson
 
01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:22.990 align:start position:0%
the previous language required inperson
attendance

01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
um I I would just remind the members
 
01:59:28.069 --> 01:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
that this new drafted language remedies
 
01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
that um and it just says uh Education
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
and Training as determined by the
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
speaker um that that gives an enormous
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
amount of leeway in terms of the form
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
and delivery
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
um frankly a memo sent out could
 
01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
probably satisfy the requirements of
 
01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
this um but I I think purely you know if
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
for no other reason than as a legal
 
01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:52.669 align:start position:0%
for no other reason than as a legal
measure

01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:52.679 align:start position:0%
measure
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
for the house uh and the the speaker to
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
be able to say that our members have
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
been trained accordingly um is certainly
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
an appropriate thing to have
 
02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
happen then Osborne has his hand up sen
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
wbor yes thank you uh so I'll say the
 
02:00:14.669 --> 02:00:14.679 align:start position:0%
same thing about this as the as the
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
other proposals that we have for
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
training and that is that uh TR training
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
does not belong in House Rules
 
02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:23.910 align:start position:0%
does not belong in House Rules
that

02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
um uh the best way to get people to uh
 
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
uh attend training that you want them to
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
do is to convince them that they should
 
02:00:36.030 --> 02:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
not not to force them to and I think
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
you'll have a much uh much higher level
 
02:00:40.910 --> 02:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
of attendance uh if we are to offer
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
these trainings on a voluntary basis and
 
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh to the representative Smith uh any of
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
these trainings uh that you set up uh I
 
02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
will commit to attend and uh hear what
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
discussion I don't see any hands up Mr
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%

now should be appearing on your
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative marjerie Smith uh
 
02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
presented please thank you very much Mr
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
chair I could in the interests of people
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
getting exhausted ask to remove this um
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
and some subsequent amendments but I
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
will not do that because I believe this
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
and those that have preceded it and will
 
02:02:48.189 --> 02:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
follow are important additions and I
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
would rest my case um that we need to
 
02:02:57.629 --> 02:02:57.639 align:start position:0%
have um training and and
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
education um to prevent the creation of
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
a hostile work environment based on
 
02:03:08.589 --> 02:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
actions that have gone on again and
 
02:03:13.390 --> 02:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
again and again it is important that as
 
02:03:16.990 --> 02:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative Osborne says that we find
 
02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
a way to encourage people to do this but
 
02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:23.390 align:start position:0%
a way to encourage people to do this but
we

02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
found that
 
02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
without specific rules nobody pays
 
02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
attention to elements of the environment
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
that we create that we nurture in the
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and therefore I think it is
 
02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
in keeping with representative Osborne's
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
comments that we include this language
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
to encourage and make clear that members
 
02:03:54.189 --> 02:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
of the legislature
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
staff um officers should have a much
 
02:04:02.109 --> 02:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
better idea of what a hostile work
 
02:04:05.709 --> 02:04:05.719 align:start position:0%
environment is not for any individual
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
but for every individual because actions
 
02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
which for one of us might seem to be
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
perfectly innocent and harmless cause
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
pain for others and all of us can
 
02:04:24.109 --> 02:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
benefit from being exposed to some
 
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
different ways of viewing how we behave
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
ourselves and how we behave with
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
reference to others I ask for you to
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
68

02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
68
 
02:04:44.159 --> 02:04:46.830 align:start position:0%
68
okay

02:04:46.830 --> 02:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh somebody want to make a make a motion
 
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.069 align:start position:0%
uh somebody want to make a make a motion
sentive

02:04:53.069 --> 02:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
sentive
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
Weber I will move that we accept house
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
rule 68 the amendment rule 68 is there a
 
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
second second second sh
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Cushing has his
 
02:05:12.239 --> 02:05:13.510 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Cushing has his
hand

02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
hand
 
02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr Mr Speaker I just will
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
say that I think that the state house
 
02:05:21.470 --> 02:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
that the House of Representatives should
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
be a safe space for all and that by
 
02:05:26.910 --> 02:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
adopting this uh Amendment we'll take a
 
02:05:29.149 --> 02:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
step forward to ensuring that that is
 
02:05:29.159 --> 02:05:31.030 align:start position:0%
step forward to ensuring that that is
the

02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
discussion a quick note it looks like
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
the the speaker um the house Clerk's on
 
02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
the phone but I have my hand up if I can
 
02:05:45.669 --> 02:05:45.679 align:start position:0%
be recognized okay I see sorry
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
representativ go
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
ahead um I'd just say similar to the
 
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
last one um I I think it you know in the
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
unfortunate possible situation where uh
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
an employee of the house were to you
 
02:06:01.870 --> 02:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
know experience a hostile work
 
02:06:03.790 --> 02:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
environment and file a lawsuit against
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
the House of
 
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
Representatives um it it would probably
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
be advantageous for The house's legal
 
02:06:14.350 --> 02:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
council to be able to say um in terms of
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know protecting the liability of the
 
02:06:18.549 --> 02:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
house as an
 
02:06:22.109 --> 02:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
institution um for the house Council to
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
be able to say that legislators did
 
02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
receive this training um rather than
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
just leave it up to Hope and good luck
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
um that the you know that everyone just
 
02:06:36.830 --> 02:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
decided to attend of their own free will
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
and their own just good nature um I I
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
think I mean I I agree with what
 
02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Osborne had said earlier
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
um that you know it is far preferable
 
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
just as a motivational tool in in a
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
general abstract concept
 
02:06:54.549 --> 02:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
um to get people to want to do the right
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
thing um but in a situation like this
 
02:06:59.229 --> 02:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
where there are like potential legal
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
consequences and lawsuit settlements at
 
02:07:05.549 --> 02:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
stake um I I'm sorry we just don't live
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
in that world yet and I wish that we did
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
um I I think this is very important just
 
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
to protect the
 
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
institution further
 
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
discussion Representative Steven Smith
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
has his hand up okay Representative
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
Steven Smith
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair look I I agree that
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
this is training that legislators should
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
get I'm actually a little on the fence
 
02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
about legislative staff if that should
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
come from someplace else or not but the
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
bottom line is when you do this through
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
house rules what happened last time was
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
we began with a great big fight about
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
whether or not this belongs in house
 
02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
rules I don't even know if we ever got
 
02:07:45.790 --> 02:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
to the part of the conversation where we
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
talked about whether the training was a
 
02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
good idea so I'm going to vote against
 
02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
this but I'm also going to give you
 
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
might pledge that if anybody would like
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
me to work on it or I'm in a position to
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
do so I'll put the together the training
 
02:08:01.069 --> 02:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
together and try to persuade people to
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
attend it or just slip it into an
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
orientation training maybe they won't
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
even know what happen so there are a lot
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
of ways to do this without deliberately
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
setting up a fight and I I know
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
representativ Marjorie Smith has really
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
good intentions in doing this but I
 
02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
still think that's what's going to
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
happen we're going to talk about the
 
02:08:21.750 --> 02:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
fight not the topic so that's why can't
 
02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
support it represent Weber has her hand
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
up representative Weber thank you Mr
 
02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
chair and um uh with representative
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
Osborne sentiment on some of the other
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
issues I will just say I wish we could
 
02:08:41.229 --> 02:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
find a way of making it clear that this
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
needs to happen because it's a
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
requirement of every other
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
Workforce in the
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
State uh that they have both all of
 
02:08:54.549 --> 02:08:54.559 align:start position:0%
these kinds of trainings and I have
 
02:08:56.109 --> 02:08:56.119 align:start position:0%
found the ones that we've had for the
 
02:08:59.069 --> 02:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
State House immeasurably useful even
 
02:09:01.069 --> 02:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
though I attend them regularly year
 
02:09:04.350 --> 02:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
after year I always learn something new
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
about ways of relating people and I
 
02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
found that they generated very good
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
conversations uh among among
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
Representatives but I just want to say
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
this I understand that there would be a
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
huge fight about it and with
 
02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Osborne I don't want to
 
02:09:24.430 --> 02:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time on that but it seems
 
02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
bizarre to me that we spend so much
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
energy fighting something which is a
 
02:09:31.549 --> 02:09:31.559 align:start position:0%
requirement for virtually every other
 
02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
workplace in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:09:37.390 --> 02:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
discussion don't see any Mr
 
02:09:49.629 --> 02:09:49.639 align:start position:0%
chair I'm gonna um if there be no
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
further discussion I'll uh I'll uh ask
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the roll the motion is
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
to accept the motion is to accept Okay
 
02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative Packard
 
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
no representative
 
02:10:08.549 --> 02:10:08.559 align:start position:0%
Osborne no representative rice no
 
02:10:11.229 --> 02:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
Representative Steven Smith no
 
02:10:11.239 --> 02:10:12.750 align:start position:0%
Representative Steven Smith no
Representative

02:10:12.750 --> 02:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
sbor no representative Cushing yes
 
02:10:20.669 --> 02:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
representative sherff yes representative
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
Smith oh sorry I thought I was muted um
 
02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
yes okay the motion to accept fails five
 
02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:33.549 align:start position:0%
yes okay the motion to accept fails five
to

02:10:33.549 --> 02:10:33.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:37.709 --> 02:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
four we'll move on to the next point of
 
02:10:41.549 --> 02:10:41.559 align:start position:0%
order if I might yes represent question
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I I know how the vote
 
02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:45.599 align:start position:0%
would come out I I I realized that in
 
02:10:48.549 --> 02:10:48.559 align:start position:0%
the last motion and L Mo this in the
 
02:10:51.629 --> 02:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
last um proposed amendment in this at
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
least they were the Motions to not
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
accept failed um and it's logical that
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
what would be substitute with a motion
 
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
to um you know that a motion not to
 
02:11:08.109 --> 02:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
accept we don't have to do anything to
 
02:11:11.229 --> 02:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
confirm another way we just have it even
 
02:11:12.629 --> 02:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
though a motion to pass fails we don't
 
02:11:16.189 --> 02:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
have to take an affirmative step to um
 
02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
I think we're on to rule 69 if I'm
 
02:11:37.950 --> 02:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh reput Cent ative majie Smith
 
02:12:00.270 --> 02:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
please thank you um Mr chairman
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
um I think Mr chairman that all I have
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
to say about this is I rest my
 
02:12:13.549 --> 02:12:13.559 align:start position:0%
case I believe that what has transpired
 
02:12:14.910 --> 02:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
last hour or two or it seems like 102
 
02:12:22.030 --> 02:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
hours but I know it hasn't been um we
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
have had vote after vote after
 
02:12:30.750 --> 02:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
vote that was based not on the merits of
 
02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:32.149 align:start position:0%
vote that was based not on the merits of
The

02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
The
 
02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
Proposal I believe but on
 
02:12:42.030 --> 02:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
unconscious bias on the part of
 
02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee we look at
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
something we see where it's coming from
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
and we just assume that is something
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
that we really aren't interested in or
 
02:12:57.790 --> 02:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
we aren't willing to support and we
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
don't stop to think about what we are
 
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
doing is affecting the quality of the
 
02:13:09.549 --> 02:13:09.559 align:start position:0%
lives of other people this is one more
 
02:13:13.629 --> 02:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
proposal for training that I believe is
 
02:13:16.990 --> 02:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
essential for legislators and
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
legislative office and legislative staff
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be exposed to what unconscious bias
 
02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
really means and how when we think we're
 
02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:31.599 align:start position:0%
doing something
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
that's right when we're really offending
 
02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
the person who was the recipient of our
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
comments it's not necessarily done
 
02:13:45.629 --> 02:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
deliberately it's not done with any
 
02:13:49.629 --> 02:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
negative um intentions but nonetheless
 
02:13:53.709 --> 02:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
we hurt and we damage other people I
 
02:13:57.629 --> 02:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
believe it is important for legislators
 
02:14:01.310 --> 02:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
to be exposed to Education and Training
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
about a whole
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
category of behaviors that govern our
 
02:14:10.669 --> 02:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
everyday um actions in the house and
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
unconscious bias training is in some
 
02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
ways perhaps more important than the
 
02:14:20.430 --> 02:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
others that have gone before and been
 
02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:21.669 align:start position:0%
others that have gone before and been
defeated

02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
defeated
 
02:14:24.549 --> 02:14:24.559 align:start position:0%
because it is unconscious it's not that
 
02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
we say oh well we believe everybody
 
02:14:29.069 --> 02:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
should have a weapon therefore we'll be
 
02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to anything that governs um how
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
weapons are handled um we understand you
 
02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
need a driver's license to drive but you
 
02:14:40.629 --> 02:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't necessarily need a license to
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
do XY or z um
 
02:14:46.709 --> 02:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
and I know I'm I'm Meandering I'm
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
Meandering I guess because I'm so
 
02:14:52.510 --> 02:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
frustrated but we don't know what we
 
02:14:55.750 --> 02:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
don't know and unconscious biased
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
training is an attempt to address that
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
so that we can say oh I had no idea that
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
I was offending you by doing what I
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
routinely do now one would hope you
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
would think first about whether you're
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrating bias and I urge you to
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
69 to include unconscious biased
 
02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:41.149 --> 02:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
motion representative Cushing has his
 
02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
hand up representative Cushing thank you
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I move I move that we ought
 
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
to accept this amendment and I like to
 
02:15:51.709 --> 02:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
second yeah you know briefly I think the
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
the question about unconscious bi bias
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
is particularly important to people of
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
color who are within our institutions
 
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
who operate it um I think we recognize
 
02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
that the you know the majority of the
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
legislature is of um you know a a a
 
02:16:18.149 --> 02:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
European uh background and perspective
 
02:16:21.870 --> 02:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
or American European and what we don't
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
do very well is deal with kind of the
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
the the everyday acts of of racism that
 
02:16:32.830 --> 02:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
are that do damage to people of color
 
02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
within the legislature and people of
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
color throughout the state of New
 
02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think this is a way that we
 
02:16:40.669 --> 02:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
can take an affirmative steps to make
 
02:16:43.950 --> 02:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
our uh our our legislature our state a
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
more welcoming um and inclusive place I
 
02:16:49.709 --> 02:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
note that just earlier this year the New
 
02:16:51.709 --> 02:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
um recognized the existence of
 
02:16:57.469 --> 02:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
unconscious bias um in a in a kind of a
 
02:16:59.870 --> 02:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
landmark case and really put it upon the
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
state and and in in the institutions to
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
try to take uh affirmative steps to U
 
02:17:09.309 --> 02:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
remediate the unconscious bias and I
 
02:17:11.309 --> 02:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
think that's that's what will take place
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
when we adopt this rule thank
 
02:17:18.549 --> 02:17:18.559 align:start position:0%

02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair um I'll take a
 
02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
breath I I find it ironic that the
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
motivation for the votes that I've cast
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
today were assumed by the sponsor of
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
this uh amendment to house
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
rules I have not lied to you today I
 
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
have not been insincere and my
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
objections to many of the amendments
 
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
were just how they were simply the fact
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to make that that thing
 
02:17:53.669 --> 02:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
sto ringing I apologize there my son
 
02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
took care of it so um I think it's a
 
02:17:59.950 --> 02:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
better house rule that we're never
 
02:18:01.870 --> 02:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to assume motivation or
 
02:18:03.790 --> 02:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
anything but simply the fact that came
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
before us and the Very fact that we're
 
02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
even talking about this to me is a
 
02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
violation of that rule which should be
 
02:18:13.830 --> 02:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
one that's like sacred
 
02:18:16.629 --> 02:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
so this is a box we shouldn't open if
 
02:18:19.790 --> 02:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
people want this training fine but think
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
about how it was presented Ed with an
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
assumption about why each of us voted
 
02:18:28.709 --> 02:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
the way we have today um even if I
 
02:18:30.750 --> 02:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
agreed with the concept based on that I
 
02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't possibly vote for this and I
 
02:18:38.030 --> 02:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
won't representative cushion yeah just
 
02:18:41.150 --> 02:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
um to to representer Smith I I want to
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
speak that I do not presume that you
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
have at any time time today acted in a
 
02:18:49.629 --> 02:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
manner other than out of your sincere
 
02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
beliefs and so just want to set that and
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
the same goes for everybody who's on
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
this committee we may disagree I don't
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
sincerity uh further
 
02:19:08.190 --> 02:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
discussion um I don't see any hands up
 
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I I'm I'm sorry I I
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry representative marjerie
 
02:19:18.589 --> 02:19:18.599 align:start position:0%
Smith but I do take a little bit of
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
offense in that you're in insinuating
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
that we're voting against this because
 
02:19:25.709 --> 02:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
you're of the a different
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
party and uh that is not the case um it
 
02:19:33.030 --> 02:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
has been in
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
previous rules committee
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
meetings when the majority party is in
 
02:19:40.589 --> 02:19:40.599 align:start position:0%
effect they
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
usually accomplish what their goals are
 
02:19:46.349 --> 02:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
uh we have different
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
philosophies and if our philosophies are
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
different than yours I don't think we
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
should be chastised
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
for voting the way we feel is right um
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
You and I have had a long relationship
 
02:20:02.349 --> 02:20:02.359 align:start position:0%
but I I do take some offense to that
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I'm sorry I did not
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
want to say that but I I just can't
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:18.030 --> 02:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
insinuations representative Weber has
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
her hand up Mr represent Weber
 
02:20:26.309 --> 02:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm I'm sorry about
 
02:20:26.319 --> 02:20:28.309 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm I'm sorry about
previous

02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
previous
 
02:20:31.309 --> 02:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
um Expressions concern because I can
 
02:20:33.270 --> 02:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
understand where they're coming from and
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
I I just want to speak personally for
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
myself and sort of redirect the
 
02:20:42.190 --> 02:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
discussion and redirect the dog at the
 
02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
same time uh redirect the discussion
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
about this particular issue
 
02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
because I was
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
startled and horrified to find that on a
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
couple of occasions when I with the best
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
will in the
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
world um I'm I'm thinking of an occasion
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
where um uh I complimented a person of
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
African-American descent on something
 
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
for on something they've written
 
02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
and I compliment people only when I
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
truly and sincerely mean a compliment
 
02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
from the bottom of my heart what I had
 
02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
not realized is that uh for many people
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
of African-American descent when they
 
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
are told by a white person that they
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
wrote something well what they hear in
 
02:21:42.429 --> 02:21:42.439 align:start position:0%
their ears whatever I meant is I don't
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
believe you know how to write the
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
English language and I
 
02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
think that in a time where all of us are
 
02:21:54.590 --> 02:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
working hard at
 
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
reexamining how we relate to each other
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
different races people of different
 
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
backgrounds um and and this is not
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
limited simply to race issues um I think
 
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
that having a vehicle to start those
 
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
discussions and have those
 
02:22:22.750 --> 02:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:25.710 --> 02:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
um without questioning anybody's motives
 
02:22:28.510 --> 02:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
for it is is really truly important and
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's why I support this U legislation
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%

you very much Mr chair could I ask you
 
02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
um a question um understanding the
 
02:24:17.790 --> 02:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
difficulties of this system would it not
 
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
have been appropriate
 
02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:21.950 align:start position:0%
have been appropriate
when

02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
um comments were
 
02:24:28.230 --> 02:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
made uh specifically
 
02:24:31.469 --> 02:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
criticizing uh something that I said to
 
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
give me an opportunity to respond I did
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
not have that opportunity and I just
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise that point um but I will
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.429 --> 02:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
110 and what this does is try again to
 
02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
make clear the importance of the role of
 
02:24:58.439 --> 02:24:59.349 align:start position:0%
make clear the importance of the role of
the

02:24:59.349 --> 02:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
speaker in
 
02:25:05.110 --> 02:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
determining how we are to function
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
within the
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
legislature when there are external
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances that have that are out of
 
02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:16.950 align:start position:0%
circumstances that have that are out of
our

02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
control but where we then have to decide
 
02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
how we can best function this supports
 
02:25:27.269 --> 02:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
the um the language of the recent
 
02:25:30.590 --> 02:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling and helps to make
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
it possible for us to best meet the
 
02:25:36.990 --> 02:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
health and safety requirements of all
 
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
members of the house and the public by
 
02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
permitting a hybrid of both remote and
 
02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:46.349 align:start position:0%

inperson

02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
participation all of this being directed
 
02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:50.910 align:start position:0%
participation all of this being directed
by

02:25:50.910 --> 02:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:25:59.230 --> 02:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:07.150 --> 02:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
this uh representative
 
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
Weber I would move we accept this and I
 
02:26:17.389 --> 02:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
would ask to speak to my motion second Z
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
second second and
 
02:26:24.670 --> 02:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
seconds go ahead ribs water I would move
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
acceptance and um the the one of the
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
things I want to point out is that this
 
02:26:38.030 --> 02:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
um we have adopted rules um unanimously
 
02:26:41.389 --> 02:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh periods of
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
covid in the past we have had rules that
 
02:26:49.389 --> 02:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
allow us to operate in times of enemy
 
02:26:49.399 --> 02:26:51.349 align:start position:0%
allow us to operate in times of enemy
attack

02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
attack
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
um whether covid was an enemy attack or
 
02:26:58.269 --> 02:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
not was an issue um probably not what
 
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
was intended when that constitutional
 
02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
amendment was adopted uh but this
 
02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:06.550 align:start position:0%
amendment was adopted uh but this
amendment

02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
specifically uh would allow us in the
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
event of some
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
other um unforeseen event that I I don't
 
02:27:21.550 --> 02:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
know what it would be but it tracks uh
 
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
some legislation that other legislators
 
02:27:29.309 --> 02:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
legislator have that in the event that
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
something else God
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
forbid horrible
 
02:27:38.269 --> 02:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
happens that we have in our rules the
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
ability to deal with it and it requires
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh the speaker to make a determination
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
and it requires the concurrence of both
 
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
the majority and the minority leader
 
02:27:55.870 --> 02:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
before this would come into effect and
 
02:27:59.269 --> 02:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
um it it it would just
 
02:28:03.150 --> 02:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
allow the legislature to continue in the
 
02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
face of the next
 
02:28:09.269 --> 02:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
unimaginable thing that comes along
 
02:28:13.269 --> 02:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
because last December I had no idea that
 
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
we would be dealing with the issues that
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
we started dealing with in March and
 
02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
continue to deal with now so I I urge
 
02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:22.110 align:start position:0%
continue to deal with now so I I urge
the

02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:28:31.389 --> 02:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:33.550 --> 02:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
discussion uh representative Tim Smith
 
02:28:36.870 --> 02:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
has his hand up representative Tim Smith
 
02:28:39.389 --> 02:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I would point
 
02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
out that you know similar to to some of
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
the previous rule uh changes we've
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
considered I see this as empowering and
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
accommodating you know the the speaker
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
of the house and the house leadership um
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
as representative Weber had said uh you
 
02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
know we don't know what sort of
 
02:29:01.870 --> 02:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
disasters may come up in the future and
 
02:29:03.630 --> 02:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
I I think that adding something like
 
02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
this that creates uh a little bit more
 
02:29:07.990 --> 02:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
of a broad
 
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
Authority um in an emergency situation
 
02:29:12.429 --> 02:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
and you know it's not unchecked
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
Authority uh you know it involves the
 
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
the majority leader and the minority
 
02:29:18.630 --> 02:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
leader in situations you know I mean
 
02:29:20.550 --> 02:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
maybe an asteroid Falls from space who
 
02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
the heck knows um where there's clear
 
02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:26.429 align:start position:0%
the heck knows um where there's clear
and

02:29:26.429 --> 02:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
uncontentious um situa uh circumstances
 
02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
out in the public that you know create
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
the need for us to make some minor
 
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
alterations for how we do business um
 
02:29:41.550 --> 02:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
that the speaker and the institution
 
02:29:44.670 --> 02:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
don't find ourselves kneecapped by our
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
our own rules requirements um and and
 
02:29:49.389 --> 02:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
need to go through you know Byzantine
 
02:29:49.399 --> 02:29:50.670 align:start position:0%
need to go through you know Byzantine
procedure

02:29:50.670 --> 02:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh that and and like find ourselves in a
 
02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
situation where the procedure we need to
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
execute in order to give ourselves the
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility itself becomes an unworkable
 
02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
procedure so that the nature of the
 
02:30:09.710 --> 02:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
emergency precludes us from reacting to
 
02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:10.429 align:start position:0%
emergency precludes us from reacting to
the

02:30:10.429 --> 02:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
emergency um to an extent that's the
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
situation we found ourselves in with a
 
02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
viral pandemic um that I don't think
 
02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
anyone would dispute
 
02:30:23.429 --> 02:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
um you know society as a whole was not
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
really prepared for I mean it hasn't
 
02:30:27.230 --> 02:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
happened in a hundred years like this um
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
and I I think adding this section to our
 
02:30:31.830 --> 02:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
rules gives a little bit more
 
02:30:33.790 --> 02:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility going forward and an extra
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
blanket of protection for you know
 
02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:40.590 align:start position:0%
blanket of protection for you know
unforeseen

02:30:40.590 --> 02:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:48.030 --> 02:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:51.389 --> 02:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
discussion uh I don't see any hands Mr
 
02:30:55.469 --> 02:30:55.479 align:start position:0%
chairman I just um throw in a little bit
 
02:30:55.479 --> 02:30:57.590 align:start position:0%
chairman I just um throw in a little bit
here

02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
um this is something in uh that
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
U speak of short lift and um myself and
 
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
former speaker Hench uh in the
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
facilities committee has been looking
 
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
at for what two or three months now Mr
 
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker that's correct Mr Speaker and um
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
you you know we're still in the process
 
02:31:24.510 --> 02:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
of trying to figure it all
 
02:31:30.269 --> 02:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
out uh and I I think I can categorically
 
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
say along with the former
 
02:31:35.389 --> 02:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
speaker everything that we have done up
 
02:31:38.269 --> 02:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
to this point has to been to try and
 
02:31:42.269 --> 02:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that the building is safe and
 
02:31:44.030 --> 02:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
any member coming into the building is
 
02:31:46.110 --> 02:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
going to be safe as possible it isn't
 
02:31:50.950 --> 02:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
now but uh that is our goal
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if this
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
would curtail any of that or affect that
 
02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
coming into effect but I'm cautious
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
about trying to put rules in place when
 
02:32:10.830 --> 02:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
we have a working product in front of
 
02:32:15.150 --> 02:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
us uh I I I'm just a real cautious about
 
02:32:17.790 --> 02:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
that because there still are a lot of
 
02:32:22.389 --> 02:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
unknowns and um I I just don't feel that
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is necessary at this time it may be
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
at some time that we could put something
 
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
like this together I just I just don't
 
02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
feel it's necessary at this
 
02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
time the only promise that I will make
 
02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:35.070 align:start position:0%
time the only promise that I will make
to

02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
you is if I am the speaker and I'm sure
 
02:32:41.389 --> 02:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
you all know I'm running for it I will
 
02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
make a absolute 100% commitment that I
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
would do nothing as speaker to endanger
 
02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
any person
 
02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.230 align:start position:0%
any person
and

02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:54.630 --> 02:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr Speaker and I
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate that and and
 
02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
understand it and and appreciate it from
 
02:33:06.349 --> 02:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
the bottom of my heart um and I know
 
02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
that you and the former speaker and
 
02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
others uh have put an enormous amount of
 
02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
effort into this um this does not
 
02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
mandate anything and it only allow ows
 
02:33:24.429 --> 02:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
the speaker to address with the majority
 
02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
leader and the minority leader the next
 
02:33:30.349 --> 02:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
problem that comes along that is
 
02:33:33.389 --> 02:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
particularly intractable and it also
 
02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
allows allows you should you choose to
 
02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
do so uh to hold remote meetings it
 
02:33:42.389 --> 02:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
makes it very clear that our rules allow
 
02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:45.640 align:start position:0%
the holding of remote meetings now uh
 
02:33:47.230 --> 02:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
should you determine that you need to do
 
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
so um and I I see that as being
 
02:33:54.510 --> 02:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
completely unthreatening and and part of
 
02:33:57.230 --> 02:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
the process going forward in that it
 
02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
gives you a tool that you may use uh
 
02:34:04.750 --> 02:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
both now with a
 
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
known difficulty and threat and in the
 
02:34:11.550 --> 02:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
future with what may come along very
 
02:34:14.910 --> 02:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
quickly without any uh knowledge on our
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
part of what it's going to be so um it
 
02:34:24.110 --> 02:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
it would not in any way um supplant or
 
02:34:27.269 --> 02:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
prevent the ongoing discussions that I
 
02:34:30.150 --> 02:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
know that you're already engaged in in
 
02:34:32.670 --> 02:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
terms of making arrangements going
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
forward it it doesn't require you to do
 
02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
this it simply allows you one way of
 
02:34:42.190 --> 02:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with an intractable problem if
 
02:34:45.269 --> 02:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
the intractable problem is there so I
 
02:34:47.469 --> 02:34:47.479 align:start position:0%
would I would urge the adoption because
 
02:34:50.670 --> 02:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
it does not get in the way of any of the
 
02:34:53.349 --> 02:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
things that you're already talking about
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
it it simply promotes one possibility
 
02:34:58.590 --> 02:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
for moving forward should it be useful
 
02:35:01.150 --> 02:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
to you thank you representative
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
shirtliff has his hand
 
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
up thank you chairman thank you um I
 
02:35:10.750 --> 02:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
thank my friend from London dery for his
 
02:35:13.349 --> 02:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
earlier comments but I'd also uh
 
02:35:14.750 --> 02:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
publicly thank him for all the
 
02:35:18.269 --> 02:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
cooperation I received uh from him over
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
the past two years um I don't want to
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
compliment you too much because I know
 
02:35:25.309 --> 02:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
you have an election coming up in 48
 
02:35:27.790 --> 02:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
hours so uh so I don't want to say too
 
02:35:30.429 --> 02:35:30.439 align:start position:0%
many good things about you but anyway
 
02:35:34.030 --> 02:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
um as the speaker knows um there was a
 
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
time during the last session when we
 
02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
passed a similar rule to this in order
 
02:35:41.070 --> 02:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
to get our business done in the 11th
 
02:35:44.269 --> 02:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
Hour of the previous bium and there was
 
02:35:47.349 --> 02:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
a time that I made a request and asked
 
02:35:49.510 --> 02:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
the concurrence of the two leaders and
 
02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:50.309 align:start position:0%
the concurrence of the two leaders and
uh

02:35:50.309 --> 02:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
one of the leaders said no and so what I
 
02:35:54.389 --> 02:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to do didn't come about so there
 
02:35:57.269 --> 02:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
is that check and balance but I think
 
02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
whomever our our leader our speaker will
 
02:36:02.349 --> 02:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
be in the uh next pium I think it gives
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
them an opportunity to have one more
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
arrow in their quiver in the event that
 
02:36:09.910 --> 02:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
things should happen things that we may
 
02:36:12.750 --> 02:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
never even think of at this moment to be
 
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
able to act and get the cooperation of
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
the two parties um as you know Mr
 
02:36:21.309 --> 02:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker what we deal with last year was
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
far above partisan politics and I think
 
02:36:25.469 --> 02:36:25.479 align:start position:0%
everybody tried to work in the best
 
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
interest of our staff our members in the
 
02:36:30.750 --> 02:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
general public and I think this uh
 
02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment would give the opportunity to
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
the next speaker to have this ability to
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
call on the leadership of the two
 
02:36:39.070 --> 02:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
caucuses uh to get things done that need
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be done in a in a in
 
02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
a quick manner in order to uh be act in
 
02:36:47.630 --> 02:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
the best interests of the
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
um you and I have a um a good friendship
 
02:37:07.150 --> 02:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
Mrs speaker yeah we have a good
 
02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
friendship um um we disagree
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
philosophically a lot but uh you know I
 
02:37:17.070 --> 02:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
I do consider you a good friend and I
 
02:37:20.510 --> 02:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
would hope that who
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
ever is in the majority in the majority
 
02:37:25.030 --> 02:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:37:27.790 --> 02:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
future would do that
 
02:37:30.550 --> 02:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
automatically without having to have a
 
02:37:36.309 --> 02:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
rule put in place I I I think I have
 
02:37:40.510 --> 02:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
enough faith in us as
 
02:37:46.349 --> 02:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
legislators and us as people to do
 
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
that and that's why I have a problem
 
02:37:53.269 --> 02:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
with this type of an amendment because I
 
02:37:55.110 --> 02:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
just feel
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
that if we can't work together on
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
something like that then there's a real
 
02:38:03.150 --> 02:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
problem systemic problem and has to be
 
02:38:06.030 --> 02:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
has to be fixed and I would hope
 
02:38:07.349 --> 02:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
02:38:10.910 --> 02:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
our um philosophical dealings when it
 
02:38:12.510 --> 02:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
comes to health and
 
02:38:15.550 --> 02:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
safety of whatever might come you know
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the future that we would do that
 
02:38:20.349 --> 02:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
automatically without having a rule
 
02:38:23.070 --> 02:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
saying that you know we could do or have
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
to do it I I that's just me I guess I
 
02:38:30.269 --> 02:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
just really believe that we would we
 
02:38:32.510 --> 02:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
would do that
 
02:38:38.349 --> 02:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.510 --> 02:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
friend representative Cushing has his
 
02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
hand up Mr chairman representative
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
kushin I'm sorry um I I just want to say
 
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
that I I share your sentiment about uh
 
02:38:51.469 --> 02:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
an expectation that whomever is the
 
02:38:53.910 --> 02:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
leader whatever party is in power that
 
02:38:56.389 --> 02:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
in times of emergency we will work
 
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
together um and I you know and I that's
 
02:39:02.910 --> 02:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
why consistent with that I think this is
 
02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
a simple ground authority to whomever
 
02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:06.790 align:start position:0%
a simple ground authority to whomever
the

02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:39:10.510 --> 02:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
speak in times of Crisis not with
 
02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
the you know is as a as is the m is
 
02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative of the minority um one
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
might think that I would be reluctant to
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
give overpower to the speaker at any
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
given moment but I'm perfectly you know
 
02:39:27.750 --> 02:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
I I I will be supporting this because I
 
02:39:29.790 --> 02:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
think that in times of emergency there
 
02:39:32.830 --> 02:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
should be a clear uh delineation of
 
02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
authority to the speaker with
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
consultation of course with a majority
 
02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
but you know to act to take the steps
 
02:39:42.269 --> 02:39:42.279 align:start position:0%
that are necessary to um you know in in
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:53.269 --> 02:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:55.309 --> 02:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
discussion if there be no further
 
02:39:58.510 --> 02:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
discussion um would you
 
02:40:01.710 --> 02:40:01.720 align:start position:0%

please thank you very much um Mr
 
02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:40.110 align:start position:0%
please thank you very much um Mr
chair

02:41:40.110 --> 02:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:41:45.469 --> 02:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
um we propose this amendment to rules in
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
the same way that we have proposed a
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
number of other
 
02:41:54.830 --> 02:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
rules and while it appears that my
 
02:41:58.190 --> 02:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
comments in the past were misunderstood
 
02:42:02.750 --> 02:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
and for that I have great
 
02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
regret um it gives me an opportunity to
 
02:42:11.349 --> 02:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
reinforce here that these proposals were
 
02:42:13.830 --> 02:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
made by the
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
minority knowing that we were in the
 
02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
minority but determined
 
02:42:24.190 --> 02:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the power of the
 
02:42:28.110 --> 02:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
speaker was clear knowing that the
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
speaker would be of another party but
 
02:42:34.269 --> 02:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
believing in the Integrity of the house
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
and the importance of the house being
 
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
able to function under circumstances
 
02:42:43.230 --> 02:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
which we might not have anticipated we
 
02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to give power to the speaker and
 
02:42:50.990 --> 02:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
in fact I would make a minor little
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
change in this um amendment by saying
 
02:42:58.670 --> 02:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
that um the word majority in the third
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
line should be
 
02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
capitalized um so it's the majority and
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
the minority leader um but all this does
 
02:43:12.510 --> 02:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
is to try to strengthen the role and the
 
02:43:15.230 --> 02:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
power and acknowledge the power that the
 
02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
speaker should have when there is an
 
02:43:21.230 --> 02:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
emergency it isn't in fact the same
 
02:43:24.030 --> 02:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
principle that has occurred in several
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
other uh proposals including the one
 
02:43:29.790 --> 02:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
that was just voted down and I would ask
 
02:43:33.269 --> 02:43:33.279 align:start position:0%
for your support for this because it is
 
02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
important that it be clear that the
 
02:43:39.550 --> 02:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
speaker has the authority and that in
 
02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
order to overrule the actions of the
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
speaker it would take 2third of the
 
02:43:49.790 --> 02:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
members of the House voting
 
02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:56.990 align:start position:0%
members of the House voting
thank

02:43:56.990 --> 02:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:59.590 --> 02:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
you sentive Weber has her hand raised Mr
 
02:44:02.950 --> 02:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
chairman all right thank you uh Paul my
 
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
screen just went blank so you're GNA
 
02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
have to in representative Weber I would
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
move that we accept the um
 
02:44:14.670 --> 02:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
motion is there a
 
02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:17.070 align:start position:0%
motion is there a
second

02:44:17.070 --> 02:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:44:20.349 --> 02:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
second uh discussion
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative um Weber and
 
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative Tim Smith have their
 
02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
hands raised uh representative Weber I
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
would just say that un unlike the uh
 
02:44:32.269 --> 02:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
earlier one which
 
02:44:35.349 --> 02:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
contemplated a broad range of
 
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances um this one is very
 
02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
severely limited and and would uh occur
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
only under state of emergency so uh it
 
02:44:49.389 --> 02:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
it is a very limited extension of extra
 
02:44:52.510 --> 02:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
powers to the speaker but um I think
 
02:44:56.590 --> 02:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
it's one that as as we have seen might
 
02:44:59.830 --> 02:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
be very useful so I urge its adoption
 
02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:01.230 align:start position:0%
be very useful so I urge its adoption
thank

02:45:01.230 --> 02:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
you representative Tim Smith Mr chair
 
02:45:04.439 --> 02:45:05.670 align:start position:0%
you representative Tim Smith Mr chair
representative

02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:45:10.190 --> 02:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um you know similar to
 
02:45:12.110 --> 02:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
some of the other amendments that were
 
02:45:16.309 --> 02:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
proposed um I I think that this provides
 
02:45:19.950 --> 02:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
a a very important um sort of an escape
 
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
hatch uh you know for the speaker if we
 
02:45:25.110 --> 02:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in another unfortunate
 
02:45:27.469 --> 02:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
situation uh you know in this case a
 
02:45:29.790 --> 02:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
state of emergency officially declared
 
02:45:31.389 --> 02:45:31.399 align:start position:0%
you know through the executive branch of
 
02:45:33.349 --> 02:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
the the state or the the federal
 
02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
government um you know in that
 
02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunate possible situation um I
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
would rather us have something in rules
 
02:45:46.590 --> 02:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
where the speaker could you know take
 
02:45:48.309 --> 02:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
some measures to move our meeting
 
02:45:50.469 --> 02:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
location or change the time or move a
 
02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
deadline you know or some other abstract
 
02:45:55.110 --> 02:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
consideration we haven't really thought
 
02:45:57.190 --> 02:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
of change the parking Arrangements you
 
02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
know whatever um without having to worry
 
02:46:03.630 --> 02:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
about inventing language to grant that
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
Authority and having it
 
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
inserted uh you know in some emergency
 
02:46:13.309 --> 02:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
basis or or having that uh Authority you
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
know be an ambiguous matter that needs
 
02:46:18.190 --> 02:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
to be submitted to the judicial branch
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
um to see if if the if the speaker even
 
02:46:23.429 --> 02:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
has the authority to you know um move
 
02:46:25.309 --> 02:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
our our parking Arrangements across the
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
street or something uh you know in a in
 
02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
a state of
 
02:46:31.990 --> 02:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
emergency um and as keeping with you
 
02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
know a lot of other house traditions and
 
02:46:35.990 --> 02:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
everything this this power uh of the
 
02:46:37.910 --> 02:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
speaker is not unchecked there is that
 
02:46:39.469 --> 02:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
provision at the end that members of the
 
02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
House can override such an action just
 
02:46:45.150 --> 02:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
to prevent the extremely unlikely
 
02:46:48.510 --> 02:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
scenario of some kind of abuse um and
 
02:46:50.349 --> 02:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
you know representative Cushing alluded
 
02:46:51.630 --> 02:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
you know as a as a member of the
 
02:46:54.230 --> 02:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
minority party this term it might not be
 
02:46:56.110 --> 02:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
politically advantageous for me to
 
02:46:59.070 --> 02:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
support giving more emergency power to a
 
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house who you know we can
 
02:47:03.070 --> 02:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
do math is going to be from the other
 
02:47:06.349 --> 02:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
party um but I I think as a practical
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
consideration it is extremely important
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
for the institution um that the speaker
 
02:47:14.110 --> 02:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh have some Authority like this clearly
 
02:47:16.870 --> 02:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
laid out in the rules without having to
 
02:47:21.469 --> 02:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
just hope and you know rely on uh the
 
02:47:27.670 --> 02:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:30.670 --> 02:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
object is there representative Cushing
 
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
has his representative Cushing um just I
 
02:47:36.070 --> 02:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
want to say as an institutionalist and
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
by that I mean someone who supports the
 
02:47:40.110 --> 02:47:40.120 align:start position:0%
institution of our of the legislature
 
02:47:42.030 --> 02:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
itself I just think that this is an
 
02:47:45.269 --> 02:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
important rule for us to adopt um and
 
02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't really matter who's
 
02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh what part's in charge what really
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
matters is that whoever the speaker is
 
02:47:55.630 --> 02:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
has the authority to act uh to in the
 
02:47:57.630 --> 02:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
best interest of the house itself and
 
02:48:00.389 --> 02:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
explicitly Representative Steve Smith
 
02:48:06.990 --> 02:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:10.670 --> 02:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
SM thank you Mr chair the my concern
 
02:48:13.389 --> 02:48:13.399 align:start position:0%
with this is the there's no limitation
 
02:48:16.990 --> 02:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
on this so in the case of an emergency
 
02:48:18.830 --> 02:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
if we have a big storm sometimes
 
02:48:20.389 --> 02:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
emergency is declared so that we can
 
02:48:22.590 --> 02:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
qualify for FEMA funds does this mean
 
02:48:27.070 --> 02:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
that or not it isn't defined um and then
 
02:48:29.389 --> 02:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
anytime there is an emergency let's
 
02:48:31.309 --> 02:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
assume the speaker the majority leader
 
02:48:33.030 --> 02:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
and the minority leader all get along
 
02:48:35.950 --> 02:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
pretty well they can literally do
 
02:48:37.790 --> 02:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
anything they want because there's no
 
02:48:41.630 --> 02:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
scope here um no limitations and then
 
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
the members of the House well they can
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
always overr it override it by a
 
02:48:46.230 --> 02:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote but what if one of the
 
02:48:47.790 --> 02:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
things a speaker does is not have any
 
02:48:49.630 --> 02:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
sessions for a while
 
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
so I think we already have the ability
 
02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
to move deadlines as necessary but to
 
02:48:59.110 --> 02:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
just let three people in any case have a
 
02:49:01.349 --> 02:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know ultimate Authority instead
 
02:49:03.150 --> 02:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
of a 400 member
 
02:49:05.830 --> 02:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislature I I can't support it without
 
02:49:12.750 --> 02:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:15.269 --> 02:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
definitions is anybody else wish to
 
02:49:17.229 --> 02:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
speak representative Tim Smith has his
 
02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
hand up again okay representative Smith
 
02:49:23.110 --> 02:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um just a quick followup to
 
02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
the the concerns raised by um the other
 
02:49:27.910 --> 02:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um there is some
 
02:49:29.630 --> 02:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
limiting of the scope in there it it
 
02:49:32.229 --> 02:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
does specifically say uh take such
 
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
actions as is necessary to ensure the
 
02:49:37.790 --> 02:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
continued operations of the house um so
 
02:49:40.750 --> 02:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
it it it is at least limited to that
 
02:49:43.349 --> 02:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
particular um you know scope of
 
02:49:43.359 --> 02:49:51.870 align:start position:0%
particular um you know scope of
authority

02:49:51.870 --> 02:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:55.110 --> 02:49:55.120 align:start position:0%

five question of the
 
02:50:52.429 --> 02:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
chair yes ah it's back yes um Mr Speaker
 
02:50:54.030 --> 02:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if it would be possible
 
02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
for us to take a short three minute
 
02:50:57.630 --> 02:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
break so that some of us who've been
 
02:50:59.150 --> 02:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
sitting here for three hours might
 
02:51:02.110 --> 02:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
attend to something quickly uh

leave we will take that F minute recess
 
02:51:23.070 --> 02:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith has presented
 
02:51:24.550 --> 02:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
all of her amendments so I would just
 
02:51:26.990 --> 02:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
like to uh thank her for for being with
 
02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
us this this morning and into the
 
02:51:31.590 --> 02:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon and I also thank
 
02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for her uh absolute
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
diligence and putting all these
 
02:51:40.710 --> 02:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
forward uh even though we disagree and
 
02:51:42.990 --> 02:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
some of them uh I thank her for bringing
 
02:51:45.670 --> 02:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
them forward uh yeah if we uh I think we
 
02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
could all use a five minute break I get
 
02:51:49.429 --> 02:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
up and walk around myself for a few
 
02:51:52.469 --> 02:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
minutes and whatever other functions
 
02:51:53.790 --> 02:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
that need to
 
02:51:59.309 --> 02:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
happen so I see it's 5 1254 by my clock
 
02:52:01.150 --> 02:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh if I think I'm right so let's

02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:11.950 align:start position:0%

02:52:24.269 --> 02:52:24.279 align:start position:0%
reason why that might have happened that

numerically uh numerically works all
 
03:00:28.229 --> 03:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:32.269 --> 03:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
25 thank you hang on just a moment let
 
03:00:50.870 --> 03:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:56.469 --> 03:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
chairman uh go ahead representer
 
03:01:03.389 --> 03:01:03.399 align:start position:0%
Prout thank you uh this amendment does
 
03:01:05.710 --> 03:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
uh three things uh first it adds a
 
03:01:07.750 --> 03:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
clarifying mention that joint rules do
 
03:01:10.389 --> 03:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
not always exist uh this really confused
 
03:01:11.630 --> 03:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
me at first I misook what I was
 
03:01:13.670 --> 03:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
referencing to to the alignment of
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
deadlines in our calendar with the other
 
03:01:17.910 --> 03:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
body uh joint rules haven't been adoped
 
03:01:22.269 --> 03:01:22.279 align:start position:0%
Ed since the 1995 96 session uh I think
 
03:01:24.590 --> 03:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's u a bit awkward to have a reference
 
03:01:25.910 --> 03:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
in our rules to something that doesn't
 
03:01:28.349 --> 03:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
exist and I think this annotation uh on
 
03:01:31.389 --> 03:01:31.399 align:start position:0%
line two there will make it much
 
03:01:33.790 --> 03:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
clearer uh second it clarifies that a
 
03:01:36.070 --> 03:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
notice or reconsideration cannot hold up
 
03:01:37.790 --> 03:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
a bill pass the applicable deadline to
 
03:01:40.590 --> 03:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
act or crossover in our house rules uh
 
03:01:42.110 --> 03:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
previously the reference was only to Jo
 
03:01:44.469 --> 03:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
joint rules uh this has been the way we
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
operate already but I think this tries
 
03:01:49.750 --> 03:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
to just make it a lot clearer
 
03:01:52.630 --> 03:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh third and this is what is directly
 
03:01:54.110 --> 03:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
related to the situation I encountered
 
03:01:56.349 --> 03:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
with the late introduction of House Bill
 
03:01:59.190 --> 03:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
1717 regarding Growlers last year this
 
03:02:01.389 --> 03:02:01.399 align:start position:0%
rule makes reconsiderations out of order
 
03:02:03.550 --> 03:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
after a bill has been read a third time
 
03:02:06.030 --> 03:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
if we were acting on that bill pass the
 
03:02:08.150 --> 03:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
applicable deadline pursu to pursuing to
 
03:02:09.429 --> 03:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
a rule
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
suspension the audity that house bill
 
03:02:15.190 --> 03:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
1717 ran into is once the deadlines are
 
03:02:17.229 --> 03:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
suspended for a bill that suspension
 
03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
stands in made the notice of
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
reconsideration in order consequently my
 
03:02:22.590 --> 03:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
bill was held in the house until the
 
03:02:24.349 --> 03:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
notice of reconsideration expired and
 
03:02:26.790 --> 03:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
missed any practical time period for the
 
03:02:29.750 --> 03:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
Senate to act on it uh please note that
 
03:02:31.910 --> 03:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
this would uh only affect motions to
 
03:02:33.790 --> 03:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
reconsider and notice of
 
03:02:35.630 --> 03:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
reconsideration uh that would affect
 
03:02:37.349 --> 03:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
both uh so a motion for an immediate
 
03:02:38.790 --> 03:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
third reading on Bill would act to
 
03:02:41.429 --> 03:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
similar to a failed motion to reconsider
 
03:02:43.269 --> 03:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
if we are acting on a bill passed its
 
03:02:46.190 --> 03:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
deadline via suspension of the rules for
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
deadlines it's my understanding
 
03:02:49.269 --> 03:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh provided the bill
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
was still in possession of the house a
 
03:02:52.110 --> 03:02:52.120 align:start position:0%
rule suspension to reconsider would
 
03:02:54.309 --> 03:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
still be in order so we could do that to
 
03:02:56.510 --> 03:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
fix any issues such as uh forgetting to
 
03:02:58.110 --> 03:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
adopt a relevant Amendment or other
 
03:03:00.990 --> 03:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
problems not that's ever happened
 
03:03:02.750 --> 03:03:02.760 align:start position:0%

03:03:06.030 --> 03:03:06.040 align:start position:0%

03:05:15.030 --> 03:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:18.190 --> 03:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
43 recognizes you
 
03:05:23.309 --> 03:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
they are uh yes you may speak yes um
 
03:05:24.990 --> 03:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
two point I just point I thought our
 
03:05:30.030 --> 03:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
practice was to only discuss one
 
03:05:32.990 --> 03:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment at a
 
03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:34.710 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment at a
time

03:05:34.710 --> 03:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:05:38.469 --> 03:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
I you're right representative I think I
 
03:05:40.389 --> 03:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
know what this is going to be I will
 
03:05:42.110 --> 03:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
separate them if it's not what I think
 
03:05:44.910 --> 03:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be and point of order may
 
03:05:48.030 --> 03:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
we have them on screen please I'm sorry
 
03:05:50.110 --> 03:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
certainly may we have them on the screen
 
03:05:55.150 --> 03:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
please oh yes y um I I I guess before we
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
go much further is it your intention
 
03:05:59.269 --> 03:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative Prout not to offer these
 
03:06:02.070 --> 03:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
two correct and I just wanted to to just
 
03:06:03.510 --> 03:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
make a brief comment as to why I'm not
 
03:06:06.510 --> 03:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
offering them okay and that's that's why
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
I I thought this was coming that's why I
 
03:06:12.070 --> 03:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh allowed that to happen Okay so if
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
nobody has an objection he can offer a
 
03:06:15.870 --> 03:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
brief comment but neither one of these
 
03:06:17.950 --> 03:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
are going to be offered go ahead
 
03:06:21.389 --> 03:06:21.399 align:start position:0%
representative Prout thank you uh so I I
 
03:06:22.990 --> 03:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
asked the clerk to draft both of these
 
03:06:24.750 --> 03:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
because um as in my speech on
 
03:06:27.469 --> 03:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
organization day I promised to ensure uh
 
03:06:29.349 --> 03:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
to mention to the rules committee all
 
03:06:32.150 --> 03:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
the changes uh from the previous term
 
03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
that were not brought forward by someone
 
03:06:37.229 --> 03:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
else to make sure that you know they are
 
03:06:40.269 --> 03:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
not forgotten and we leave them aside
 
03:06:42.110 --> 03:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
intentionally and so these two were
 
03:06:44.269 --> 03:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
those two uh I I'm not the right person
 
03:06:46.389 --> 03:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
to Champion them however all the other
 
03:06:48.790 --> 03:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
ones someone else picked up the ball to
 
03:06:50.830 --> 03:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
Champion them and uh I'm not going to
 
03:06:52.830 --> 03:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
bring them forward at this time unless
 
03:06:55.469 --> 03:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
someone had a specific request that I do
 
03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative
 
03:07:00.870 --> 03:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
Prout can we go on to the next one Mr
 
03:07:13.950 --> 03:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:20.870 --> 03:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:23.389 --> 03:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
okay were we not just told that this one
 
03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
was not going to be offered I know no
 
03:07:28.469 --> 03:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
representative that was uh 30 and uh 40
 
03:07:31.950 --> 03:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
43 I beg your pardon thank you for the
 
03:07:35.190 --> 03:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
clarification uh represent
 
03:07:38.550 --> 03:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
pro thank you this amendment would allow
 
03:07:40.950 --> 03:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
members to request late Drafting and the
 
03:07:42.910 --> 03:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
house to consider resolutions that evoke
 
03:07:45.070 --> 03:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority without the
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
suspension of rules or prior rules
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
committee approval
 
03:07:50.750 --> 03:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
I've asked OLS research for a list of
 
03:07:52.510 --> 03:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
these and there were three sections of
 
03:07:55.190 --> 03:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
Statute that provided for this two and
 
03:07:58.790 --> 03:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
RSA 445 to declare and to terminate a
 
03:08:01.990 --> 03:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
state of emergency and one in RSA 490
 
03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:02.870 align:start position:0%
state of emergency and one in RSA 490
col

03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
col
 
03:08:05.269 --> 03:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
6-a to terminate an emergency order
 
03:08:06.510 --> 03:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
issued by the Supreme Court during a
 
03:08:07.710 --> 03:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
state of
 
03:08:09.710 --> 03:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
emergency as you can see they all relate
 
03:08:11.349 --> 03:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
to emergency
 
03:08:13.950 --> 03:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
situations emergency situations don't
 
03:08:15.910 --> 03:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
happen when it's convenient they don't
 
03:08:18.229 --> 03:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
follow our legislative deadlines an LSR
 
03:08:20.830 --> 03:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
filing window our current process of
 
03:08:22.070 --> 03:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
putting these types of resolutions
 
03:08:24.110 --> 03:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
through the normal Bill filing system of
 
03:08:27.110 --> 03:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
deadlines really makes the legislature
 
03:08:29.229 --> 03:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
uh impotent during an
 
03:08:32.070 --> 03:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
emergency uh that impedence uh causes
 
03:08:33.190 --> 03:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
creates a culture of ignoring the
 
03:08:35.349 --> 03:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
legislature during an emergency not even
 
03:08:36.830 --> 03:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
Consulting us sometimes not even
 
03:08:39.389 --> 03:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
informing us I think it's critically
 
03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
important to break that culture even if
 
03:08:43.429 --> 03:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
the legislature as a whole is in favor
 
03:08:44.750 --> 03:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
of everything that is being done under
 
03:08:46.710 --> 03:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
the current state of emergency the
 
03:08:48.349 --> 03:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
culture of indicating all power and
 
03:08:50.229 --> 03:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
authority is dangerous and antithetical
 
03:08:52.389 --> 03:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
to our system of constitutional
 
03:08:54.750 --> 03:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
government and this rule is about more
 
03:08:56.150 --> 03:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
than the current state of emergency as
 
03:08:58.349 --> 03:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
well as I said for me it's about setting
 
03:08:59.830 --> 03:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
the culture in tone of how government
 
03:09:01.790 --> 03:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
branches interact for the future I think
 
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is especially true regarding the
 
03:09:05.349 --> 03:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
legislature's ability to declare a state
 
03:09:07.790 --> 03:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
of emergency I can't see how this
 
03:09:09.870 --> 03:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
section would ever be practical to use
 
03:09:11.190 --> 03:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
given the roadblocks in place to
 
03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:12.349 align:start position:0%
given the roadblocks in place to
exercising

03:09:12.349 --> 03:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
exercising
 
03:09:14.590 --> 03:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
it uh thank you for your consideration
 
03:09:17.590 --> 03:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take any questions
 
03:09:19.710 --> 03:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
representative uh Smith has a question
 
03:09:21.910 --> 03:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh why don't we get a motion
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
first uh Mr
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
Clark I'll move not to
 
03:09:27.279 --> 03:09:28.830 align:start position:0%
Clark I'll move not to
accept

03:09:28.830 --> 03:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
accept
 
03:09:33.070 --> 03:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
second okay uh say representative Tim
 
03:09:36.269 --> 03:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
Smith yes sir okay representative
 
03:09:39.070 --> 03:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
Smith uh thank you um this this might be
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
a question either for representative
 
03:09:44.750 --> 03:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
proud or for um our clerk I'm not sure
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
which but if I'm understanding the
 
03:09:51.389 --> 03:09:51.399 align:start position:0%
intent of this correctly um and I I
 
03:09:53.269 --> 03:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
really want to hope that I do uh because
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
if I'm correct on on what you're trying
 
03:09:57.630 --> 03:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
to do here this might be kind of
 
03:09:57.640 --> 03:09:59.150 align:start position:0%
to do here this might be kind of
important

03:09:59.150 --> 03:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
um is it not already possible for
 
03:10:08.750 --> 03:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
someone to ask OSS at any time to draft
 
03:10:11.870 --> 03:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
something it's only the introduction of
 
03:10:14.630 --> 03:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
something after it's drafted um that
 
03:10:16.469 --> 03:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
would require you know suspension of the
 
03:10:18.510 --> 03:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
rules and the deadline lines and I I ask
 
03:10:20.790 --> 03:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
that from a position of ignorance you
 
03:10:22.229 --> 03:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
know I've never tried to introduce
 
03:10:24.030 --> 03:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
anything outside of the regular schedule
 
03:10:26.510 --> 03:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know what the process is if
 
03:10:28.710 --> 03:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
you go to OS and ask them to draft a
 
03:10:30.630 --> 03:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
bill in the middle of
 
03:10:33.710 --> 03:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
February Mr chair I I can address that
 
03:10:36.710 --> 03:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um OS will not accept a
 
03:10:38.469 --> 03:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
request for late drafting unless they
 
03:10:40.269 --> 03:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
have unless you've had approval from the
 
03:10:40.279 --> 03:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
have unless you've had approval from the
rules

03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:10:44.630 --> 03:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee okay sorry may I ask a
 
03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
followup yes go ahead and representative
 
03:10:50.429 --> 03:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
so the the current process would be that
 
03:10:52.750 --> 03:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
um the representative or you know the
 
03:10:54.309 --> 03:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
theoretical representative not
 
03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative Prout the the
 
03:10:58.150 --> 03:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative who wanted to
 
03:11:01.030 --> 03:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
introduce one of these uh concurrent
 
03:11:03.070 --> 03:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
resolutions you know invoking statutory
 
03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
Authority would first need the approval
 
03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
of the rules committee before asking OS
 
03:11:12.229 --> 03:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
to to actually do the the drafting of
 
03:11:14.590 --> 03:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
the language that that is correct
 
03:11:17.309 --> 03:11:17.319 align:start position:0%
currently would this change uh any
 
03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
member could go to OS and and ask for
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
that to be drafted and it would be
 
03:11:25.710 --> 03:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
drafted and its introduction uh even
 
03:11:28.469 --> 03:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
after the deadline um and any subsequent
 
03:11:31.110 --> 03:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
action uh would only require a majority
 
03:11:34.110 --> 03:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
vote that includes um waving public
 
03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:35.670 align:start position:0%
vote that includes um waving public
hearing

03:11:35.670 --> 03:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:11:39.870 --> 03:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:43.790 --> 03:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
you uh for representer Weber thank you
 
03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I uh appreciate the sentiments
 
03:11:50.670 --> 03:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
that uh representative uh Prout
 
03:11:55.349 --> 03:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
suggested um and and I I share his
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
concerns uh I'm also concerned about the
 
03:12:01.269 --> 03:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
language about of any resolution
 
03:12:03.590 --> 03:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
invoking statutory Authority because it
 
03:12:05.469 --> 03:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
does not appear to me that that's as
 
03:12:08.710 --> 03:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
limited as uh the
 
03:12:13.110 --> 03:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative um expressed to us
 
03:12:15.469 --> 03:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
um there's an awful lot of things that
 
03:12:17.910 --> 03:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
invoke statutory Authority and so for
 
03:12:20.510 --> 03:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
that for that reason I think this is too
 
03:12:22.590 --> 03:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
broad and I'm going to vote against it
 
03:12:26.070 --> 03:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh further
 
03:12:29.389 --> 03:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
discussion uh representative kushin yes
 
03:12:33.070 --> 03:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
um that representative Weber um
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
expressed my concern about the broadness
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
of what statutory Authority are I see
 
03:12:38.670 --> 03:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
lots of statutory Authority and I'm
 
03:12:40.429 --> 03:12:40.439 align:start position:0%
concerned that this is just this could
 
03:12:43.349 --> 03:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
be a way to kind of circumvent the
 
03:12:46.309 --> 03:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
regular deadlines that are in place for
 
03:12:49.550 --> 03:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
um request ing Drafting and I just think
 
03:12:51.190 --> 03:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
that we should stick with the existing
 
03:12:54.630 --> 03:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
process I think it works well for
 
03:12:56.590 --> 03:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
us did you have your hand up
 
03:12:59.750 --> 03:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative Tim Smith I did um now
 
03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
that I I got an answer to my question
 
03:13:05.070 --> 03:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to share my my thoughts on this
 
03:13:09.309 --> 03:13:09.319 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have any strong objections
 
03:13:12.349 --> 03:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
or concerns about the introduction I'm
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
sorry about the the
 
03:13:17.150 --> 03:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
drafting um under these circumstances
 
03:13:18.590 --> 03:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know where a member is trying to do
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
like a um an HCR you know to invoke
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority on something um but
 
03:13:27.950 --> 03:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
my my concern is that second part about
 
03:13:30.150 --> 03:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
any subsequent consideration shall
 
03:13:32.550 --> 03:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
require only a minority vote um you know
 
03:13:34.790 --> 03:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's sort of regardless of any other
 
03:13:38.950 --> 03:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
factors um If This Were amended in such
 
03:13:42.150 --> 03:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
a way to remove that last bit about only
 
03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
requiring a minority vote to pass
 
03:13:46.429 --> 03:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
respective the deadlines I I would find
 
03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
myself in support of this um I
 
03:13:51.750 --> 03:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
personally I don't have any issue with a
 
03:13:53.870 --> 03:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
member getting something drafted you
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
know um to invoke statutory Authority as
 
03:13:59.630 --> 03:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
long as it's introduced um through the
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
you know the normal process respective
 
03:14:01.439 --> 03:14:04.790 align:start position:0%
you know the normal process respective
to

03:14:04.790 --> 03:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:07.870 --> 03:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
deadlines um representative Osborne had
 
03:14:11.870 --> 03:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:14.309 --> 03:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
Osborne oh sorry I had taken my hand
 
03:14:17.950 --> 03:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
down but I will say you know I
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I I appreciate uh where this is
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
coming from and uh and what it's trying
 
03:14:25.309 --> 03:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
to do I I I just without being able to
 
03:14:29.710 --> 03:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
think through all of the possible
 
03:14:34.670 --> 03:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
um uh future um ramifications I I I I
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
would be scared to uh suggest that we uh
 
03:14:41.429 --> 03:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:47.550 --> 03:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:51.269 --> 03:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
if if uh I may at this point um
 
03:14:51.279 --> 03:14:53.030 align:start position:0%
if if uh I may at this point um
representative

03:14:53.030 --> 03:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:14:56.269 --> 03:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
Prout from the comments
 
03:14:58.400 --> 03:14:58.410 align:start position:0%
made I think that
 
03:14:58.410 --> 03:14:59.590 align:start position:0%
made I think that
[Music]

03:14:59.590 --> 03:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:15:03.510 --> 03:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
um if you were to um withdraw this at
 
03:15:06.190 --> 03:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
its time and come back further with
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
maybe some more clarity and um you know
 
03:15:12.910 --> 03:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
tighter um you know I think a lot of us
 
03:15:18.110 --> 03:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
would probably go along with it but I
 
03:15:20.590 --> 03:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
agree that I'm hearing
 
03:15:24.030 --> 03:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
you I I think that you're a little bit
 
03:15:26.510 --> 03:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit too broad right now
 
03:15:29.830 --> 03:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think that we've we've
 
03:15:33.550 --> 03:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
considered all the um ramifications this
 
03:15:36.510 --> 03:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
could have at at some point in a future
 
03:15:38.990 --> 03:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
house session and I guess that's why I'm
 
03:15:41.469 --> 03:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
a little concerned about it the way it
 
03:15:45.630 --> 03:15:45.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's written right now um it it could
 
03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
cause regardless of the party and who's
 
03:15:51.790 --> 03:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
in power it could cause some disruption
 
03:15:56.189 --> 03:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
I think in the uh in the uh in the house
 
03:15:58.349 --> 03:15:58.359 align:start position:0%
session thank you Mr Speaker and thank
 
03:16:00.189 --> 03:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
you to all members of the committee for
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
your comments and feedback and I would
 
03:16:03.309 --> 03:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
be be given that I would be happy
 
03:16:04.790 --> 03:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
withdraw it at this
 
03:16:08.389 --> 03:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
time all right and I I I think you know
 
03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
we'd be glad to work with you
 
03:16:11.670 --> 03:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative proud to see if we can
 
03:16:14.590 --> 03:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
come to uh you know some some good
 
03:16:18.670 --> 03:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
language that we can all accept
 
03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Prout uh would you
 
03:16:24.389 --> 03:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
like to move forward with rule 57 yes
 
03:16:27.750 --> 03:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh go ahead represent Prout let me
 
03:16:36.070 --> 03:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:39.070 --> 03:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh this rule is about
 
03:16:41.670 --> 03:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
speeches under unan consent of the house
 
03:16:43.150 --> 03:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
usually near the end of our day after
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
the third reading
 
03:16:48.110 --> 03:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
motion uh the current process is that if
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent is withdrawn it
 
03:16:51.429 --> 03:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
triggers a vote on if the members should
 
03:16:52.910 --> 03:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
be allowed to continue with the consent
 
03:16:55.510 --> 03:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the house this currently requires a
 
03:16:58.030 --> 03:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
simple majority of those present this
 
03:16:59.950 --> 03:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
rule would require a two-thirds majority
 
03:17:01.510 --> 03:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
of those present for the member to
 
03:17:01.520 --> 03:17:02.990 align:start position:0%
of those present for the member to
continue

03:17:02.990 --> 03:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
continue
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
speaking we had several instances of
 
03:17:07.150 --> 03:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
issues with this last term where it came
 
03:17:09.670 --> 03:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
down to a Partyline vote I don't think
 
03:17:11.830 --> 03:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
it serves anyone well nor the house as
 
03:17:14.070 --> 03:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
an institution to have party line votes
 
03:17:16.630 --> 03:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
on this topic even though the majority
 
03:17:18.429 --> 03:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
has switch parties this year this is an
 
03:17:19.750 --> 03:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
area where I think it makes sense to
 
03:17:21.790 --> 03:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
have the rights of minority respected
 
03:17:23.309 --> 03:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
and that speeches like this should only
 
03:17:27.030 --> 03:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
be made with uh unanimous or near
 
03:17:29.229 --> 03:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
unanimous agreement of the
 
03:17:31.469 --> 03:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
members and this rule would Implement
 
03:17:32.830 --> 03:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
that by saying the bar
 
03:17:34.990 --> 03:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
two-thirds uh I would also like to note
 
03:17:37.150 --> 03:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
that um representative Jess Edwards
 
03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
worked with me and I think it was
 
03:17:40.269 --> 03:17:40.279 align:start position:0%
intention his intention to co-sponsor it
 
03:17:43.030 --> 03:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
I see the clerk doesn't have that and uh
 
03:17:44.590 --> 03:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
he's not present here so I can't get him
 
03:17:45.950 --> 03:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
to put his name on it automatically I
 
03:17:47.790 --> 03:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
don't think unless you feel that that
 
03:17:50.309 --> 03:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
was the content of his last email to you
 
03:17:52.110 --> 03:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
but uh thank you for your consideration
 
03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
and be happy to take any
 
03:17:59.590 --> 03:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:02.710 --> 03:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh is there a
 
03:18:04.870 --> 03:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
motion representer wbor you have your
 
03:18:04.880 --> 03:18:05.910 align:start position:0%
motion representer wbor you have your
hand

03:18:05.910 --> 03:18:05.920 align:start position:0%

accept is there a
 
03:18:11.640 --> 03:18:13.389 align:start position:0%
accept is there a
second

03:18:13.389 --> 03:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:18:21.349 --> 03:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:24.030 --> 03:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
representative shff has his hand up okay
 
03:18:25.429 --> 03:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
I can't see him but go ahead
 
03:18:25.439 --> 03:18:26.790 align:start position:0%
I can't see him but go ahead
representative

03:18:26.790 --> 03:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:18:29.990 --> 03:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
sherff thank you Mr chair uh Mr chair
 
03:18:33.269 --> 03:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against this um there are
 
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
times in the past I think when all of us
 
03:18:38.389 --> 03:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
have seen people speak on the floor that
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
we wish weren't up there and saying what
 
03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
they were
 
03:18:46.830 --> 03:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
saying maybe 50% of the vote or 50% Plus
 
03:18:49.910 --> 03:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
one is uh too low a bar maybe it should
 
03:18:49.920 --> 03:18:50.950 align:start position:0%
one is uh too low a bar maybe it should
be

03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:18:55.110 --> 03:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
60% but I think to to to request a 23s
 
03:18:58.710 --> 03:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
vote to deny a member of the House to
 
03:19:02.189 --> 03:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
speak under unanimous
 
03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
consent gives an awful strong position
 
03:19:09.550 --> 03:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
to the majority party um representative
 
03:19:11.309 --> 03:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
Prout mentioned about the rights of the
 
03:19:13.349 --> 03:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
minority I think the rights of the
 
03:19:15.750 --> 03:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
minority are infringed when the majority
 
03:19:17.269 --> 03:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
can simply say
 
03:19:20.990 --> 03:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
no you can't vote with a 2third vote uh
 
03:19:24.710 --> 03:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to uh to be able to
 
03:19:26.990 --> 03:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
speak that's just too big a hurdle to
 
03:19:29.469 --> 03:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
try to get over and I think what we're
 
03:19:34.429 --> 03:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
doing now with a 50% majority of vote
 
03:19:36.830 --> 03:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
works and I just don't think there's any
 
03:19:38.750 --> 03:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
need and I think this is infringes on
 
03:19:43.229 --> 03:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:48.229 --> 03:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
body thank you further discussion
 
03:19:49.830 --> 03:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative Tim Smith
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve Smith and
 
03:19:53.189 --> 03:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative Cushing is your hand up
 
03:19:56.030 --> 03:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
or not no sorry I'm just
 
03:19:59.550 --> 03:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
listening um so representative Tim Smith
 
03:20:00.990 --> 03:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
and then Representative Steve Smith
 
03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:02.710 align:start position:0%
and then Representative Steve Smith
thank

03:20:02.710 --> 03:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:20:06.429 --> 03:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
you um yeah I I kind of share the set
 
03:20:09.070 --> 03:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
sentiment of Representative shirtliff um
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
but I I also look at this from the
 
03:20:14.389 --> 03:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
opposite point of view that um you know
 
03:20:16.710 --> 03:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
it may not be politically advantageous
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
for me to oppose this but um this
 
03:20:22.790 --> 03:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
presents enormous opportunity for for
 
03:20:25.150 --> 03:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
abuse by both the majority and the
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
minority um to just shut down anyone who
 
03:20:31.150 --> 03:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
we don't like what they're saying um you
 
03:20:32.910 --> 03:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
know as far as I can recall in my time
 
03:20:37.349 --> 03:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
in the house I have never voted um to
 
03:20:39.550 --> 03:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
deny somebody unanimous consent the few
 
03:20:41.070 --> 03:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
times where there's actually been a vote
 
03:20:43.309 --> 03:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
on it regardless of what I thought about
 
03:20:46.469 --> 03:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
what they're saying um and I I worry
 
03:20:48.630 --> 03:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
that that this brings us down a slippery
 
03:20:51.469 --> 03:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
slope and sets a dangerous precedent
 
03:20:54.030 --> 03:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
where you know the the ability of
 
03:20:57.030 --> 03:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
members to to speak their mind and and
 
03:21:00.030 --> 03:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
execute you know per Personal Privilege
 
03:21:02.550 --> 03:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
like unanimous consent um is this going
 
03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
to bounce back and forth uh between
 
03:21:07.070 --> 03:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
parties you know not necessarily this
 
03:21:11.910 --> 03:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
term but maybe eight terms from now um I
 
03:21:14.309 --> 03:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
I don't like where this is going at all
 
03:21:16.070 --> 03:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
um and I'm definitely going to be voting
 
03:21:18.229 --> 03:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
against this I I think it just it just
 
03:21:21.630 --> 03:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.710 --> 03:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
abuse Representative Steve
 
03:21:27.990 --> 03:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair the the members
 
03:21:29.950 --> 03:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
that have talked to me that that were
 
03:21:31.870 --> 03:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
frustrated about this asked a really
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
good question is it unanimous consent or
 
03:21:39.070 --> 03:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
not it's really not intuitive to a lot
 
03:21:41.309 --> 03:21:41.319 align:start position:0%
of them and causes outrage when they
 
03:21:43.990 --> 03:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
find out that unanimous consent is just
 
03:21:45.790 --> 03:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
two words that don't mean a thing and
 
03:21:48.070 --> 03:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
then we can go vote and say yeah you
 
03:21:50.389 --> 03:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
know your unanimous consent didn't
 
03:21:52.550 --> 03:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
matter there are very few times where
 
03:21:55.790 --> 03:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
one representative in this giant C that
 
03:21:58.630 --> 03:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
we have in the legislature has any power
 
03:22:00.750 --> 03:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
one is the consent calendar that's
 
03:22:03.510 --> 03:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent any one of us can say
 
03:22:07.110 --> 03:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
no um in this case I've seen members of
 
03:22:09.550 --> 03:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
both parties object to unanimous consent
 
03:22:11.309 --> 03:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
over the time I've been in the
 
03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
house and if we have a thing called
 
03:22:17.870 --> 03:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent uh it it should be and
 
03:22:19.070 --> 03:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
it should
 
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
be it just should be harder I'm I will
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
vote for this um and look forward to
 
03:22:27.750 --> 03:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
people from maybe both parties working
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
with me to find a more intuitive way to
 
03:22:32.590 --> 03:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
define what you can do and what you
 
03:22:32.600 --> 03:22:33.830 align:start position:0%
define what you can do and what you
can't

03:22:33.830 --> 03:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
can't
 
03:22:36.950 --> 03:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
um but we have to start the conversation
 
03:22:39.910 --> 03:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
and this is a good way to do
 
03:22:42.229 --> 03:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
it representative Tim Smith has raised
 
03:22:44.510 --> 03:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
his hand Mr chairman Tim
 
03:22:48.550 --> 03:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
Smith so I I would um find myself in a
 
03:22:50.110 --> 03:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
bit of agreement with uh what
 
03:22:52.030 --> 03:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve Smith mentioned and
 
03:22:54.910 --> 03:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
i' I think a question to the clerk to to
 
03:22:57.670 --> 03:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
clarify might be in order but my current
 
03:23:00.150 --> 03:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
understanding is that if unanimous
 
03:23:01.710 --> 03:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
consent is
 
03:23:04.990 --> 03:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawn then the motion where we vote
 
03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
to let the person continue talking it no
 
03:23:11.309 --> 03:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
longer is unanimous consent they are
 
03:23:14.710 --> 03:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
simply speaking by consent of the house
 
03:23:17.309 --> 03:23:17.319 align:start position:0%
not by unanimous consent consent of the
 
03:23:20.550 --> 03:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
house um so it it already is as my
 
03:23:23.070 --> 03:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
understanding holds it um it already is
 
03:23:24.670 --> 03:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
something different and it's not
 
03:23:26.590 --> 03:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent if it comes down to
 
03:23:29.429 --> 03:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
that vote is uh Mr clerk is is my
 
03:23:30.990 --> 03:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of the procedure on that
 
03:23:33.229 --> 03:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
correct uh Mr chair may I answer the
 
03:23:36.070 --> 03:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
question yes you may uh you are correct
 
03:23:38.070 --> 03:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative Smith if if unanimous
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
consent is withdrawn uh and a vote is
 
03:23:43.590 --> 03:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
put to the body uh a member is is
 
03:23:46.150 --> 03:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to continue their they speaking
 
03:23:48.389 --> 03:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
with the consent of the house not
 
03:23:51.030 --> 03:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
unanimous but with consent of the
 
03:23:54.229 --> 03:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
house followup Mr chairman for the
 
03:23:57.910 --> 03:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
question so I I I would I would say that
 
03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know given that what we just
 
03:24:03.189 --> 03:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
clarified rather than introducing this
 
03:24:05.269 --> 03:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
rule change it might behoove us a little
 
03:24:07.469 --> 03:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
better to just simply educate our
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
incoming members um a little bit more uh
 
03:24:13.469 --> 03:24:13.479 align:start position:0%
precisely about the Nuance of that
 
03:24:15.790 --> 03:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
situation rather than you know go
 
03:24:18.070 --> 03:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
through the the heavy step of a rules
 
03:24:23.070 --> 03:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:34.030 --> 03:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:38.110 --> 03:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
chairman okay I'm I'm I'll abstain from
 
03:24:41.429 --> 03:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
speaking on this um if there be no
 
03:24:43.670 --> 03:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
um uh no further discussion Clerk call a
 
03:24:50.189 --> 03:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
roll the uh motion is to accept the
 
03:24:53.590 --> 03:24:53.600 align:start position:0%

representative Weber no representative
 
03:25:23.990 --> 03:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
Timothy Smith
 
03:25:33.269 --> 03:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:40.189 --> 03:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
then amendment to 65 as we've adopted it
 
03:25:55.389 --> 03:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:14.910 --> 03:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
screen uh represent proud go
 
03:26:17.150 --> 03:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr
 
03:26:20.309 --> 03:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker uh so this amendment would uh
 
03:26:22.630 --> 03:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
add an additional item to the calendar
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
of deadlines uh that this committee
 
03:26:27.389 --> 03:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
approved earlier in this meeting uh for
 
03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
a last day to concur with Senate
 
03:26:33.389 --> 03:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
amendments to house bills uh I think uh
 
03:26:36.110 --> 03:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
it was interesting to to learn last year
 
03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh in the process that we found oursel
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
in that that didn't already exist and uh
 
03:26:43.349 --> 03:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
I noticed that it was in the proposed
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
calendar last year that failed to reach
 
03:26:47.950 --> 03:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
the two-thirds majority to be uh adopted
 
03:26:51.269 --> 03:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
on our uh I believe June 11th meeting um
 
03:26:54.110 --> 03:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
and say uh as a member I was a little
 
03:26:55.309 --> 03:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
bit surprised that we didn't have a
 
03:26:57.269 --> 03:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
deadline for this already and that
 
03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
essentially uh amendments to house bills
 
03:27:01.670 --> 03:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
could be accepted all the way through
 
03:27:03.469 --> 03:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
the end of the session you know even if
 
03:27:07.229 --> 03:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
that you know is on veto day um and uh
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's something I would like to see in
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
our calendar uh proposed uh the date the
 
03:27:13.710 --> 03:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
same day as the last day to for form
 
03:27:15.469 --> 03:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
Committees of conferences but I do think
 
03:27:17.630 --> 03:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
it needs as a as an option but I do
 
03:27:19.590 --> 03:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be in C or somewhere
 
03:27:21.550 --> 03:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
so it's just not
 
03:27:23.630 --> 03:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
open-ended and uh thank you for
 
03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:30.870 --> 03:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
questions reprentative Tim
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%

Smith sorry no not a motion I had a
 
03:27:44.750 --> 03:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
question yeah can I get a motion first
 
03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
and then we can go on to the questions
 
03:27:46.319 --> 03:27:54.469 align:start position:0%
and then we can go on to the questions
and

03:27:54.469 --> 03:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:59.830 --> 03:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:03.189 --> 03:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
motion represent I I I guess I'll make
 
03:28:05.269 --> 03:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
the motion to accept but I I don't know
 
03:28:09.389 --> 03:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
whether uh I I I should vote for it or
 
03:28:12.830 --> 03:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
not okay well we can have the discussion
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:20.710 --> 03:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
repres Smith Steph Smith oh Steph Smith
 
03:28:23.670 --> 03:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative ten Smith now
 
03:28:26.790 --> 03:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
that we have a formal Motion in a second
 
03:28:28.790 --> 03:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I I apologize for for jumping
 
03:28:31.150 --> 03:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
the gun Mr chairman I'm I'm I'm more
 
03:28:32.590 --> 03:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
accustomed to regular committee
 
03:28:36.389 --> 03:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
procedure where we go back and forth um
 
03:28:38.110 --> 03:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
so my my question for representative
 
03:28:40.510 --> 03:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
prow would the would the net eff of this
 
03:28:44.030 --> 03:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
be to prevent a situation like we had
 
03:28:47.150 --> 03:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
last term um where the Senate kind of
 
03:28:49.910 --> 03:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
Amalgamated you know 50 to 60 house
 
03:28:52.830 --> 03:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
bills together as one big Amendment onto
 
03:28:56.110 --> 03:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
a house bill um because of the you know
 
03:28:58.189 --> 03:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
the situation they ran into where they
 
03:29:01.550 --> 03:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
didn't um why I shouldn't say anything
 
03:29:04.030 --> 03:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
about that but um the the situation that
 
03:29:05.630 --> 03:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
they ran into where some of their bills
 
03:29:08.309 --> 03:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
weren't necessarily being acted on uh
 
03:29:10.150 --> 03:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
because of the the emergency we found
 
03:29:13.150 --> 03:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
ourselves then so I don't think it would
 
03:29:15.070 --> 03:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
directly uh thank you for the question
 
03:29:16.229 --> 03:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
by the way I don't think it would
 
03:29:19.550 --> 03:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
directly speak to that issue as you
 
03:29:21.510 --> 03:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
stated it and the reason I say that is
 
03:29:25.750 --> 03:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
is I believe um the Senate always has
 
03:29:27.070 --> 03:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes especially in the second year
 
03:29:30.030 --> 03:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
of the BM merged multiple Bill bills
 
03:29:31.349 --> 03:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
together and sent them back to us I
 
03:29:32.590 --> 03:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
don't think and I don't think this
 
03:29:35.950 --> 03:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
amendment would do anything for uh that
 
03:29:37.870 --> 03:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
situation I I won't go so far as to call
 
03:29:40.030 --> 03:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
it a problem um I don't think this
 
03:29:41.189 --> 03:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
amendment would speak at all to that
 
03:29:43.830 --> 03:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
situation really only the calendar onto
 
03:29:46.349 --> 03:29:46.359 align:start position:0%
when that could happen um that they
 
03:29:49.189 --> 03:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
would you know that there that there is
 
03:29:51.389 --> 03:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
a I always looked at the calendar and
 
03:29:52.630 --> 03:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
thought that there was a you know a
 
03:29:55.469 --> 03:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
deadline for us to either accept Senate
 
03:29:56.590 --> 03:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
amendments or form a committee
 
03:29:58.950 --> 03:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
conference and I guess at first I never
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
realized that there really is no
 
03:30:03.349 --> 03:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
deadline for us to accept sen amendments
 
03:30:05.189 --> 03:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
you know that can be all the way through
 
03:30:07.269 --> 03:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
the end of uh the normal session year at
 
03:30:10.189 --> 03:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
the end of June or it there's no appears
 
03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
to be no prohibition against us doing it
 
03:30:13.550 --> 03:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
through the summer all the way into you
 
03:30:15.990 --> 03:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
know the fall and veto day to just vote
 
03:30:17.710 --> 03:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
to accept uh any bill that's been
 
03:30:20.070 --> 03:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
hanging out and we haven't acted on it
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
already and that's what this would
 
03:30:24.429 --> 03:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
really address is that there's any bill
 
03:30:26.229 --> 03:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
with a senate Amendment pending that
 
03:30:28.349 --> 03:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
falls way late into the
 
03:30:30.550 --> 03:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
calendar it would require a rule
 
03:30:32.269 --> 03:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
suspension to take action on
 
03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
it but not necessarily speak to how much
 
03:30:38.110 --> 03:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
or how meaty the amendment that came
 
03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
from the Senate
 
03:30:43.269 --> 03:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
is hopefully that answered your
 
03:30:46.670 --> 03:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
question Mr M Mr clerk could you
 
03:30:48.389 --> 03:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
probably maybe give us some
 
03:30:50.670 --> 03:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
clarification I I would be happy to and
 
03:30:52.429 --> 03:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
and and I note that Representatives
 
03:30:54.710 --> 03:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
Cushing Tim Smith and Weber had hands up
 
03:30:58.349 --> 03:30:58.359 align:start position:0%
um so so just to just to go back for a
 
03:31:01.309 --> 03:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
moment addressed uh last year's
 
03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
situation um if you recall uh last year
 
03:31:07.309 --> 03:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
was a a very different circumstance than
 
03:31:09.469 --> 03:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
than what we were under and that that
 
03:31:12.670 --> 03:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
will have been the only time in in in
 
03:31:15.309 --> 03:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
recent recent memory and and by my
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
recent memory I can say the last 35
 
03:31:20.309 --> 03:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
years um where you will have seen a last
 
03:31:22.110 --> 03:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
data concur with Senate amendments to
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
house bills uh being put forward that
 
03:31:28.750 --> 03:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
was done um explicitly at the time
 
03:31:31.710 --> 03:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
because of the uh truncated um time
 
03:31:34.830 --> 03:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
frame in which we were trying to deal um
 
03:31:36.790 --> 03:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
with the ability to have hearings
 
03:31:39.710 --> 03:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
remotely and to get things done on the
 
03:31:43.950 --> 03:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
floor um in an expedited manner um so
 
03:31:46.110 --> 03:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
that that the appearance of this
 
03:31:50.670 --> 03:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
language last June was uh sort of a an
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
aberration of of what um the normal
 
03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
practice is this is this would not be um
 
03:32:00.590 --> 03:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
something that that is is custom for the
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
body um and one of those one of the many
 
03:32:06.349 --> 03:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
reasons for that is that it does sort of
 
03:32:10.630 --> 03:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh handicap um the individual uh bodies
 
03:32:12.590 --> 03:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
in and by that I mean the the house or
 
03:32:15.429 --> 03:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
the senate in being able to deal with
 
03:32:18.750 --> 03:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
you know last minute emergencies or um
 
03:32:21.269 --> 03:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
things of that nature um if you were
 
03:32:23.750 --> 03:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to introduce this and put this in
 
03:32:26.189 --> 03:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
it it it might be better placed at the
 
03:32:28.870 --> 03:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
to put it in is the last day uh to put
 
03:32:30.590 --> 03:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
it in so that it concurs with the last
 
03:32:32.630 --> 03:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
day to act on Committees of conference
 
03:32:35.229 --> 03:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps um or something along those
 
03:32:38.309 --> 03:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
lines but I I I think at this point um
 
03:32:40.469 --> 03:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
you know this this this is definitely
 
03:32:42.469 --> 03:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
sort of speaking outside of the the
 
03:32:44.630 --> 03:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
realm of
 
03:32:48.309 --> 03:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
custom all Rob sen cushion yeah my
 
03:32:51.389 --> 03:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
concern has to do with the the the
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
dynamic between the house and the Senate
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned that where we don't
 
03:32:58.750 --> 03:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
have joint rules and we don't even
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily have and the Senate sets its
 
03:33:03.790 --> 03:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
own deadlines I don't want us to get in
 
03:33:07.670 --> 03:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
a position where we end up um having
 
03:33:11.670 --> 03:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
good house bills die because the Senate
 
03:33:14.269 --> 03:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't the Senate schedule doesn't fit
 
03:33:16.389 --> 03:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
our schedule um and there are sometimes
 
03:33:18.309 --> 03:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
that a you know a house bill you know it
 
03:33:19.990 --> 03:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
could be changed in effective date
 
03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
there's minor changes or friendly
 
03:33:24.309 --> 03:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
amendments that we would want to have uh
 
03:33:26.429 --> 03:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
readily adopt and I just don't want us
 
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
to be in a situation where our own
 
03:33:32.189 --> 03:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
deadline precludes us from concurring
 
03:33:35.590 --> 03:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
with good house with house bills that
 
03:33:38.630 --> 03:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
have been um acted on by the senate i it
 
03:33:40.349 --> 03:33:40.359 align:start position:0%
seems like we we're it's a setup to kill
 
03:33:41.670 --> 03:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
our own
 
03:33:44.309 --> 03:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
bills R Tim
 
03:33:47.469 --> 03:33:47.479 align:start position:0%
Smith so my
 
03:33:50.469 --> 03:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
um I I understand where uh where
 
03:33:51.990 --> 03:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative proud is coming from on
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
this and um my my questions were were
 
03:33:57.030 --> 03:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
addressed uh very satisfactorily thank
 
03:33:59.150 --> 03:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
you um my only
 
03:34:02.790 --> 03:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
hesitation is because of what happened a
 
03:34:04.389 --> 03:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
couple of terms ago where the house
 
03:34:07.630 --> 03:34:07.640 align:start position:0%
failed to pass a budget um and the other
 
03:34:09.510 --> 03:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
chamber was
 
03:34:12.670 --> 03:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
forced to craft a state budget and graft
 
03:34:14.429 --> 03:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
it as an amendment you know onto a
 
03:34:16.950 --> 03:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
non-gain house bill relatively late in
 
03:34:20.269 --> 03:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
the cycle and I I worry that you know if
 
03:34:22.110 --> 03:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves not even necessarily
 
03:34:24.429 --> 03:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
this term but in a in a future term if
 
03:34:26.229 --> 03:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves in a situation where
 
03:34:28.590 --> 03:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
we don't pass a house budget and the
 
03:34:30.189 --> 03:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
other chamber has to
 
03:34:30.199 --> 03:34:31.790 align:start position:0%
other chamber has to
scramble

03:34:31.790 --> 03:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
scramble
 
03:34:35.389 --> 03:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
um you know June 10th might not you know
 
03:34:37.750 --> 03:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
or the the other deadlines that line up
 
03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
on June 10th that that might not be uh
 
03:34:43.150 --> 03:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
really conductive to to them actually
 
03:34:45.790 --> 03:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
being able to get it done and we might
 
03:34:47.990 --> 03:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in the unenviable
 
03:34:50.870 --> 03:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
position where we need a two-thirds vote
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
to suspend our rules to allow the
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
introduction of the state budget because
 
03:34:59.309 --> 03:34:59.319 align:start position:0%
it's being presented as an amendment to
 
03:35:02.030 --> 03:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
a house bill coming out of the Senate
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
rather than as um you know the the
 
03:35:07.150 --> 03:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
original House bill that was filed you
 
03:35:10.030 --> 03:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
know in December as the placeholder um
 
03:35:12.269 --> 03:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
that's that's my my real concern with
 
03:35:15.030 --> 03:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
this and because of that I'm I'm afraid
 
03:35:18.349 --> 03:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
I can't it but I I will say that I could
 
03:35:20.429 --> 03:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
probably be convinced to support some
 
03:35:23.670 --> 03:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
similar language if that was
 
03:35:28.349 --> 03:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
addressed for the discussion oh Mr clerk
 
03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
no representative Weber Mr chair oh I'm
 
03:35:35.070 --> 03:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
sorry represent Weber thank you um I I
 
03:35:37.710 --> 03:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
just um following on the comments of the
 
03:35:39.990 --> 03:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
house Clerk and also the comments of
 
03:35:42.469 --> 03:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
Representative Cushing I think that this
 
03:35:44.830 --> 03:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
is an area in which it would be very
 
03:35:48.229 --> 03:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
unwise for for us uh to depart from our
 
03:35:51.950 --> 03:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
our usual customary practices of of
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
decades uh particularly in terms of
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
surrendering the power of the house to
 
03:35:59.110 --> 03:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate we get caught up in that a
 
03:36:02.429 --> 03:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
lot and i' I'd rather not have us
 
03:36:05.429 --> 03:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
further hamstrung thank
 
03:36:13.150 --> 03:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:16.630 --> 03:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
discussion I guess this has ridden uh R
 
03:36:19.269 --> 03:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
risen a lot of concerns and and
 
03:36:22.630 --> 03:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions on this uh and I
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
think I know where representative Pro
 
03:36:27.070 --> 03:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
wants to go but I'm I'm not sure
 
03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative Pro if you're there yet
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
um considering the concerns that uh have
 
03:36:32.160 --> 03:36:32.910 align:start position:0%
um considering the concerns that uh have
been

03:36:32.910 --> 03:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:35.229 align:start position:0%
been
risen

03:36:35.229 --> 03:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
risen
 
03:36:38.710 --> 03:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
um what I would strongly suggest and
 
03:36:42.389 --> 03:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
this is completely up to you is is of
 
03:36:42.399 --> 03:36:44.510 align:start position:0%
this is completely up to you is is of
maybe

03:36:44.510 --> 03:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:36:46.950 --> 03:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
um you know at a future rules committee
 
03:36:49.030 --> 03:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
meeting you could um you could come back
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
and and present something
 
03:36:54.429 --> 03:36:54.439 align:start position:0%
else certainly Mr Speaker I would be
 
03:36:55.950 --> 03:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
happy to withdraw at this time and and
 
03:36:57.710 --> 03:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
come back later um if I may take a
 
03:37:01.389 --> 03:37:01.399 align:start position:0%
moment just to add one extra comment yes
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
um so really also what I was trying to
 
03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
address with this was the idea that
 
03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
through the calendar the Senate could
 
03:37:11.670 --> 03:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
put us in a take it or leave it position
 
03:37:14.229 --> 03:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
because once the deadline to form
 
03:37:16.910 --> 03:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
committees a conference has passed
 
03:37:18.870 --> 03:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
that's the position we're in it's a take
 
03:37:21.910 --> 03:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
it or leave it um it's not a let's form
 
03:37:23.349 --> 03:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
a committee conference and work out the
 
03:37:25.590 --> 03:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
differences and so that's that is part
 
03:37:27.150 --> 03:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
of the reason why I chose that same
 
03:37:29.510 --> 03:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
deadline um but I'm happy to at this
 
03:37:32.389 --> 03:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
time withdraw it and uh bring it back in
 
03:37:35.670 --> 03:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
the future and uh have more discussion
 
03:37:38.950 --> 03:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
offline sounds like a plan thank you
 
03:37:38.960 --> 03:37:41.870 align:start position:0%
offline sounds like a plan thank you
representative

03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:48.550 --> 03:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:48.560 --> 03:37:49.469 align:start position:0%
 
I

03:37:49.469 --> 03:37:49.479 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
think I think that does it for
 
03:37:51.479 --> 03:37:53.389 align:start position:0%
think I think that does it for
representative

03:37:53.389 --> 03:37:53.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:37:58.189 --> 03:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
representa next we have representative
 
03:38:05.550 --> 03:38:05.560 align:start position:0%

rep um I don't believe representative

representative Abramson I did see him a
 
03:39:08.279 --> 03:39:09.389 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson I did see him a
moment

03:39:09.389 --> 03:39:09.399 align:start position:0%
moment
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
ago uh Max Abramson there we
 
03:39:16.429 --> 03:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
go representative Abramson is joined you
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:28.189 --> 03:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
up how are you folks doing this
 
03:39:31.189 --> 03:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
afternoon fine representative abon
 
03:39:32.990 --> 03:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're good to
 
03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
is um this is a the amendment or this
 
03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
proposed rule change is similar to uh
 
03:39:47.550 --> 03:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
what representative Prout brought up um
 
03:39:49.950 --> 03:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
it is uh of course very different
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
wording I understand that uh you've just
 
03:39:55.710 --> 03:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
ruled on uh um the other uh
 
03:39:59.469 --> 03:39:59.479 align:start position:0%
representative prout's Amendment but uh
 
03:40:00.870 --> 03:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
it deals with the issue that we have
 
03:40:02.550 --> 03:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
house resolution sometimes they deal
 
03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
with current events issues for example
 
03:40:08.590 --> 03:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
the passing of U uh representative hinch
 
03:40:13.030 --> 03:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
um but also the uh um the uh emergency
 
03:40:17.710 --> 03:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh rules by the governor um sometimes
 
03:40:20.590 --> 03:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
things happen in the middle of session
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
and someone wants to propose a house rle
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
or a house resolution to uh memorialize
 
03:40:30.389 --> 03:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
someone or something or an attack or
 
03:40:32.189 --> 03:40:32.199 align:start position:0%
something that's happened like the
 
03:40:34.710 --> 03:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
September 11th attack uh can happen at
 
03:40:37.830 --> 03:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
any time during the year um the other
 
03:40:39.950 --> 03:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
reason for proposing this allowing house
 
03:40:41.790 --> 03:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
resolutions and concurrent resolutions
 
03:40:44.349 --> 03:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
to be brought in later in the term is to
 
03:40:46.269 --> 03:40:46.279 align:start position:0%
try to encourage members who have the
 
03:40:49.389 --> 03:40:49.399 align:start position:0%
idea for a house resolution I have uh I
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
have a couple up myself uh that are in
 
03:40:58.550 --> 03:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
drafting and um rather than uh for
 
03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
something in particular that isn't a
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
policy bill or that isn't Bound for the
 
03:41:04.870 --> 03:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate is just to delay that until
 
03:41:07.150 --> 03:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
later in the session maybe even until
 
03:41:10.349 --> 03:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
April or May when uh things are slowing
 
03:41:11.870 --> 03:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
down and we have only a handful of
 
03:41:14.910 --> 03:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
Senate bills to deal with um I don't
 
03:41:19.309 --> 03:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
believe that we should try to um adapt
 
03:41:21.630 --> 03:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
to the current rules and deadlines that
 
03:41:23.670 --> 03:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
the state senate has because the state
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
senate changes
 
03:41:28.950 --> 03:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
their uh changes their deadlines and
 
03:41:30.550 --> 03:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
changes their rules in the same way we
 
03:41:33.429 --> 03:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
change our rules oh here comes my
 
03:41:33.439 --> 03:41:35.830 align:start position:0%
change our rules oh here comes my
cat

03:41:35.830 --> 03:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
cat
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
um and um we can't we can't uh depend on
 
03:41:43.510 --> 03:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
on what they're going to do over time so
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
understand that prout's uh amend M does
 
03:41:49.590 --> 03:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
almost the same thing and uh if uh you
 
03:41:52.389 --> 03:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
want me to get back with him uh maybe we
 
03:41:55.870 --> 03:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
can uh uh work out what what type of
 
03:41:57.670 --> 03:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
wording members of the committee want to
 
03:42:01.710 --> 03:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:05.790 --> 03:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
forward oops so is is it your intention
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative Aon to withdraw this at
 
03:42:11.030 --> 03:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
this time um I want I wanted to get
 
03:42:13.790 --> 03:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
input from the rules committee before um
 
03:42:17.670 --> 03:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:17.680 --> 03:42:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:42:20.750 --> 03:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:25.309 --> 03:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
um if you might consider taking it off
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
um let me um tell you what um I think my
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
concern is and and maybe some of the
 
03:42:35.630 --> 03:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
other members concern is is the last
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
sentence uh any house resolution or C
 
03:42:42.429 --> 03:42:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:46.670 --> 03:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
time what few of us discussed was that
 
03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:42:51.149 --> 03:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
language the minority
 
03:42:54.790 --> 03:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
party towards the end of a session day
 
03:42:58.269 --> 03:42:58.279 align:start position:0%
could flood the body with innumerable
 
03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
amount of uh of uh resolutions or
 
03:43:00.960 --> 03:43:02.469 align:start position:0%
amount of uh of uh resolutions or
concurrent

03:43:02.469 --> 03:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
concurrent
 
03:43:06.229 --> 03:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
resolutions um just to cause um chaos in
 
03:43:07.349 --> 03:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
a manner of
 
03:43:10.469 --> 03:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
speaking and I have a real concern that
 
03:43:12.990 --> 03:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
um I would hope that would never happen
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
but to me this opens that up for for it
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
to allow it to happen uh that
 
03:43:21.990 --> 03:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
um if one party or the other was a
 
03:43:23.630 --> 03:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
little bit upset about something what
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
the other party did and they came in
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
with 20 to 30 resolutions or house
 
03:43:31.950 --> 03:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
resolutions uh it would would um not
 
03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
only throw a wrench into the spikes as I
 
03:43:36.990 --> 03:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
call it but throw take the whole wheel
 
03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
off so to me that's a serious concern
 
03:43:42.790 --> 03:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
that I think needs to be addressed
 
03:43:45.790 --> 03:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
before I could uh you know approve some
 
03:43:47.309 --> 03:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
I mean why I could vote for something
 
03:43:47.319 --> 03:43:48.750 align:start position:0%
I mean why I could vote for something
like

03:43:48.750 --> 03:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:43:51.950 --> 03:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
this let uh move it to the I've got my
 
03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
house rules book open move it to the
 
03:43:57.189 --> 03:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
deadline of
 
03:44:00.550 --> 03:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
um the same as the last oh sorry my cat
 
03:44:03.389 --> 03:44:03.399 align:start position:0%
just jumped in my lap last day to act on
 
03:44:05.070 --> 03:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference reports which is
 
03:44:10.429 --> 03:44:10.439 align:start position:0%
June we could set that as U cat we could
 
03:44:16.010 --> 03:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
move the the the come on sorry out
 
03:44:16.020 --> 03:44:17.910 align:start position:0%
move the the the come on sorry out
[Music]

03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:44:19.830 --> 03:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
buy just jumped in right in the middle
 
03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
of hearing what's that representative
 
03:44:25.229 --> 03:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
Weber has her hand up MREs Weber has go
 
03:44:28.110 --> 03:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
ahead wees Weber I just want to add the
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
comment to to yours Mr chairman that uh
 
03:44:33.870 --> 03:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
it would not necessarily take the entire
 
03:44:36.670 --> 03:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
minority party it could be just several
 
03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
members of the house or even a single
 
03:44:41.309 --> 03:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
member of the House who would able to
 
03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
grind matters to a complete Halt and uh
 
03:44:47.469 --> 03:44:47.479 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what we set for a
 
03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
deadline that would be irrelevant so I I
 
03:44:53.429 --> 03:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
think that this is a matter that really
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
requires a great deal more thought and
 
03:44:57.950 --> 03:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
discussion before it's as we say ready
 
03:45:00.910 --> 03:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
for Prime Time thank you and if I just
 
03:45:03.349 --> 03:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
may jump in at this point uh I think it
 
03:45:05.070 --> 03:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
was before your time representative
 
03:45:08.590 --> 03:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
Benson but a past member threatened to
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
pull I think it was like 100 100
 
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
um bills off the ENT calendar because
 
03:45:18.349 --> 03:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
they were upset at something I don't
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
even remember what it was so you know
 
03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
this to me has the
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
same connotation of being U something
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
that could really cause some
 
03:45:31.510 --> 03:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
problems I think that was during my time
 
03:45:35.790 --> 03:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
as a matter wasn't that um yes 2015 or
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
2016 M from man I want to get into the
 
03:45:40.510 --> 03:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
member's name or anything like that but
 
03:45:45.030 --> 03:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
the situation did happen uh and and I if
 
03:45:46.830 --> 03:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
I remember we were able to squash some
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
of it but that's not saying it couldn't
 
03:45:52.189 --> 03:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
happen in the future or this could be uh
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
just absolutely 20 or 30 or 40
 
03:45:57.550 --> 03:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
resolutions introduced by you know as as
 
03:45:59.229 --> 03:45:59.239 align:start position:0%
representative Weber said one or two
 
03:46:02.750 --> 03:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
members uh that could really really U
 
03:46:04.110 --> 03:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
file things
 
03:46:06.189 --> 03:46:06.199 align:start position:0%
up uh represent question do you have
 
03:46:08.309 --> 03:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
your hand up I just I I I want to agree
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
with what you had to say and also with
 
03:46:11.389 --> 03:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
what representative Weber had to say and
 
03:46:13.950 --> 03:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
also say that you know there if there's
 
03:46:17.710 --> 03:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
a matter of urgency that needs um a
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
resolution then it's we can just move to
 
03:46:22.590 --> 03:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
suspend all the rules that usually the
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
majority minority leader together will
 
03:46:26.030 --> 03:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
move to suspend the rules to take it up
 
03:46:28.990 --> 03:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
right then or there's always the the
 
03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
possibility you can come back before the
 
03:46:31.710 --> 03:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
rules committee and asked to have the
 
03:46:34.110 --> 03:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
rules suspended for late introduction
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I I I think there are some men
 
03:46:39.030 --> 03:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
other methods of uh doing this
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative abenson other than taking
 
03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
the possibility of opening it up to uh
 
03:46:45.359 --> 03:46:47.229 align:start position:0%
the possibility of opening it up to uh
uh

03:46:47.229 --> 03:46:47.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
misuse well someone can do that right
 
03:46:53.309 --> 03:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
now anyone who's got a the manual the
 
03:46:55.189 --> 03:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
general court can pop that open and and
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
look for ways to uh to filibuster we've
 
03:47:00.349 --> 03:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
seen that not every session but we've
 
03:47:03.389 --> 03:47:03.399 align:start position:0%
seen attempts to filibuster and keep us
 
03:47:05.550 --> 03:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
uh in session for a very long period of
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
time um and we have seen uh there's
 
03:47:10.670 --> 03:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
still some duplicate bills I pulled uh
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
three of my bills because they were four
 
03:47:13.950 --> 03:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
of my bills because they were similar to
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
other people's bills but you can have
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
you can have members uh abuse the system
 
03:47:24.750 --> 03:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
right now pretty badly um I I don't
 
03:47:27.550 --> 03:47:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:29.830 --> 03:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's I don't think that that's reason
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
enough I think that that the that
 
03:47:34.189 --> 03:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
members who have house resolutions
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
should delay them until uh the
 
03:47:39.550 --> 03:47:39.560 align:start position:0%
springtime but my other concern is
 
03:47:41.550 --> 03:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
obviously the September 11th attack
 
03:47:44.990 --> 03:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
happened in September um and any
 
03:47:48.510 --> 03:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
memorializing or any house resolution or
 
03:47:52.950 --> 03:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh house condemnation of an act or or or
 
03:47:56.030 --> 03:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
a policy position for example an
 
03:47:56.040 --> 03:47:57.590 align:start position:0%
a policy position for example an
HCR

03:47:57.590 --> 03:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
HCR
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
um responding to uh the the governor's
 
03:48:02.590 --> 03:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
emergency orders we didn't have the
 
03:48:04.590 --> 03:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
ability as the
 
03:48:07.630 --> 03:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
house um coming to session to challenge
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
that uh either the minority party or the
 
03:48:11.990 --> 03:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
majority party could effectively
 
03:48:15.870 --> 03:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
prevent um that question from beinging
 
03:48:17.630 --> 03:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
being brought forward even though there
 
03:48:19.349 --> 03:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
was a tremendous amount of public
 
03:48:21.110 --> 03:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
interest and concern for that issue and
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of our business Community hurt by
 
03:48:25.790 --> 03:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
that um but the main thrust of this of
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
course is to try to take a pretty good
 
03:48:34.510 --> 03:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
sized number of HRS and hcrs and uh um
 
03:48:36.510 --> 03:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
that come up and and kind of bog us down
 
03:48:38.110 --> 03:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
in January and February and try to push
 
03:48:40.030 --> 03:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
it till after budget day crossover day
 
03:48:44.830 --> 03:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:47.070 --> 03:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
well we never formally took a motion and
 
03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh if you uh wish to have us move
 
03:48:52.469 --> 03:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
forward with a vote we'll do that um so
 
03:48:55.630 --> 03:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll well I'll with I I'll
 
03:49:00.429 --> 03:49:00.439 align:start position:0%
I'll take your um uh concerns to heart
 
03:49:03.309 --> 03:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
and I'll withdraw this motion um and
 
03:49:06.830 --> 03:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to uh representative Prout and
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh see if we can work something
 
03:49:12.389 --> 03:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
out that's a that's a that's a good plan
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative avenson very good plan
 
03:49:19.510 --> 03:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:21.510 --> 03:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
forward okay let me see if
 
03:49:29.910 --> 03:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:33.070 --> 03:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
us I do not believe that he
 
03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
has so uh representative Timothy
 
03:49:39.389 --> 03:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
Smith is now
 
03:49:58.910 --> 03:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:00.510 --> 03:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
should be on your
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
screen thanks I'll um I'll step around
 
03:50:05.389 --> 03:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
to the the other side of the the table
 
03:50:07.229 --> 03:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
for a minute or
 
03:50:12.070 --> 03:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
two so decades ago um the New Hampshire
 
03:50:14.990 --> 03:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
house made history by being I believe
 
03:50:18.030 --> 03:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
the first but if not one of the first
 
03:50:22.870 --> 03:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislative Chambers in the country to
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
Institute that every Bill introduced
 
03:50:27.550 --> 03:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
gets an up or down vote on the floor of
 
03:50:30.750 --> 03:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
the house we removed the ability of
 
03:50:32.349 --> 03:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
individual committee chairs to be
 
03:50:33.950 --> 03:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
Gatekeepers on
 
03:50:33.960 --> 03:50:35.630 align:start position:0%
Gatekeepers on
legislation

03:50:35.630 --> 03:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:50:40.630 --> 03:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
um we now take that for granted and I I
 
03:50:42.910 --> 03:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
think the vast majority of members of
 
03:50:45.670 --> 03:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
the house would recognize that as a
 
03:50:45.680 --> 03:50:47.189 align:start position:0%
the house would recognize that as a
positive

03:50:47.189 --> 03:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
positive
 
03:50:50.349 --> 03:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
development however at the time it was
 
03:50:52.870 --> 03:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
seen as highly controversial um because
 
03:50:54.910 --> 03:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
it was you know a somewhat dramatic
 
03:50:57.429 --> 03:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
shift uh away from the the Norms that
 
03:50:57.439 --> 03:50:58.790 align:start position:0%
shift uh away from the the Norms that
existed

03:50:58.790 --> 03:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
existed
 
03:51:02.189 --> 03:51:02.199 align:start position:0%
then and you know it's only now decades
 
03:51:04.510 --> 03:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
later that that we recognize how Forward
 
03:51:08.429 --> 03:51:08.439 align:start position:0%
Thinking and historic that is um and and
 
03:51:11.070 --> 03:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of us probably wish that
 
03:51:13.550 --> 03:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
other states in the federal Congress
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh operated in a similar
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
manner last term the New Hampshire house
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
made history Again by being the first
 
03:51:25.590 --> 03:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
legislative chamber in the country to
 
03:51:28.990 --> 03:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
recognize the rights of the people we
 
03:51:32.670 --> 03:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
represent to be heard with preference
 
03:51:36.030 --> 03:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
over the paid special interest lobbyists
 
03:51:38.590 --> 03:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
you know who bring a sponsored point of
 
03:51:41.149 --> 03:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
view um to the
 
03:51:43.790 --> 03:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
legislature and uh one of the side
 
03:51:47.030 --> 03:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
effects of the the way that the rules
 
03:51:49.870 --> 03:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
were changed on organization day um is
 
03:51:51.790 --> 03:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
that you know this was uh one of the
 
03:51:53.710 --> 03:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
things that was removed kind of as
 
03:51:57.389 --> 03:51:57.399 align:start position:0%
collateral damage um and so my my
 
03:51:59.149 --> 03:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
introduction is just restoring The
 
03:52:02.110 --> 03:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
Identical language to house rule 100
 
03:52:04.149 --> 03:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
that committee chairs will ensure on a
 
03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
best effort basis that members of the
 
03:52:08.790 --> 03:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
public are recognized to testify at
 
03:52:11.790 --> 03:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
public hearings before individuals
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
properly identified as lobbyists um um
 
03:52:16.950 --> 03:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
all of the the commentary when I
 
03:52:19.149 --> 03:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
presented this two years ago uh still
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
applies I believe all of us were were in
 
03:52:24.590 --> 03:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
the house then um so I I won't drone on
 
03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
you know with a lot of the same
 
03:52:29.910 --> 03:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
arguments um other than to say that
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
after this was adopted by the house um
 
03:52:34.550 --> 03:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
and you know got out there and was
 
03:52:38.149 --> 03:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
noticed by the Press um this proved to
 
03:52:38.159 --> 03:52:39.550 align:start position:0%
noticed by the Press um this proved to
be

03:52:39.550 --> 03:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
enormously popular with the general
 
03:52:47.309 --> 03:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
public regardless of party regardless of
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
ideology regardless of you know advocacy
 
03:52:54.070 --> 03:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
groups or anything else everybody out
 
03:52:57.389 --> 03:52:57.399 align:start position:0%
there loved this I I even got some
 
03:52:59.790 --> 03:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
positive feedback from some registered
 
03:53:02.229 --> 03:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
lobbyists um saying that introducing a
 
03:53:06.070 --> 03:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
measure like this um you know it helped
 
03:53:08.429 --> 03:53:08.439 align:start position:0%
them defend the Integrity of their
 
03:53:10.349 --> 03:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
profession by saying look we're not
 
03:53:13.110 --> 03:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
getting special treatment and and I I
 
03:53:16.070 --> 03:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
think they they had some Merit to that
 
03:53:19.110 --> 03:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
argument I would challenge
 
03:53:22.030 --> 03:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
anyone to find even one member of the
 
03:53:24.269 --> 03:53:24.279 align:start position:0%
general public who is not you know a
 
03:53:27.309 --> 03:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
retired state legislator who opposes
 
03:53:31.110 --> 03:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
this um I think that this change does a
 
03:53:34.630 --> 03:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
very good job of actually representing
 
03:53:38.149 --> 03:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
the people who elected us of empowering
 
03:53:40.510 --> 03:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
the people who elected us and I I
 
03:53:42.910 --> 03:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
realize it's easy to to take something
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
like this and just casually miss it as
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
no we should just you know leave the
 
03:53:50.710 --> 03:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
committee chairs Alone um but decades
 
03:53:53.710 --> 03:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
ago you know we were brave enough to
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
take the take the stance that the
 
03:53:58.189 --> 03:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
committee chairs are not going to get to
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
serve as Gatekeepers on
 
03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
legislation and I would very humbly ask
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
the members of the rules committee to
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
once again allow the house to be brave
 
03:54:12.269 --> 03:54:12.279 align:start position:0%
enough again and make history again to
 
03:54:15.389 --> 03:54:15.399 align:start position:0%
retain the rule change that we're not
 
03:54:16.990 --> 03:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
going to have committee chairs be
 
03:54:19.229 --> 03:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
Gatekeepers against members of the
 
03:54:22.269 --> 03:54:22.279 align:start position:0%
public um and with that I will take
 
03:54:24.910 --> 03:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
questions um and I'll step back around
 
03:54:28.990 --> 03:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
needed uh I see
 
03:54:36.389 --> 03:54:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and uh
 
03:54:39.670 --> 03:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair you and myself and several
 
03:54:41.110 --> 03:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
people on this committee have been
 
03:54:44.149 --> 03:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
committee chairs so I asked a question
 
03:54:46.349 --> 03:54:46.359 align:start position:0%
uh of the member from Manchester under
 
03:54:50.750 --> 03:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
the the word the verbage best effort
 
03:54:52.630 --> 03:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
when a committee chair determines that
 
03:54:54.510 --> 03:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's in the best interest of the
 
03:54:57.550 --> 03:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
committee and to expedite a hearing to
 
03:55:01.229 --> 03:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
hear from a lobbyist U before hearing
 
03:55:03.750 --> 03:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
from the general public would that be
 
03:55:06.870 --> 03:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
permissible under this rule
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
change it wouldn't be covered by this
 
03:55:13.229 --> 03:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
rule change if someone regardless of who
 
03:55:15.990 --> 03:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
they are um and again I I mentioned this
 
03:55:17.349 --> 03:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago but I'm happy to
 
03:55:20.149 --> 03:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
mention it to clarify um if somebody is
 
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
invited by the committee to testify um
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know that's not the same thing as
 
03:55:26.269 --> 03:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
someone showing up and just randomly
 
03:55:28.110 --> 03:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
signing the pink sheet which is the
 
03:55:31.309 --> 03:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
scenario this is addressing um and the
 
03:55:34.349 --> 03:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
language on a best effort basis um you
 
03:55:36.149 --> 03:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
know that's that's there to assume some
 
03:55:38.110 --> 03:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
good faith on the part of the the
 
03:55:39.790 --> 03:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
committee chair it's entirely possible
 
03:55:41.790 --> 03:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
and we've all seen it happen that
 
03:55:43.630 --> 03:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
someone will show up and sign in to
 
03:55:43.640 --> 03:55:45.269 align:start position:0%
someone will show up and sign in to
testify

03:55:45.269 --> 03:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:55:47.870 --> 03:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
and you know they're a lobbyist and they
 
03:55:49.790 --> 03:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
don't mention that they're a lobbyist on
 
03:55:51.510 --> 03:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
the pink sheet not out of any malicious
 
03:55:53.590 --> 03:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
intent just you know the way they signed
 
03:55:54.830 --> 03:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
it or the group they signed is
 
03:55:56.429 --> 03:55:56.439 align:start position:0%
representing or maybe they forgot or
 
03:55:58.710 --> 03:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
they're new or whatever um and and
 
03:56:01.030 --> 03:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
nobody's at fault in those situations so
 
03:56:03.510 --> 03:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of the phraseology
 
03:56:05.269 --> 03:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
best effort basis is to make it clear
 
03:56:07.389 --> 03:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
that no one's at fault um in that sort
 
03:56:09.189 --> 03:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
of a situation but to answer your
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
question very specifically this would
 
03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
not curtail in any way the authority of
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
a committee chair to invite in someone
 
03:56:21.149 --> 03:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
um you know as a special guest of the
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
committee in advance um to testify on
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
the bill and to place them wherever they
 
03:56:27.750 --> 03:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
wanted in the speaking
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
order I don't want to Bel the point but
 
03:56:34.110 --> 03:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
just to be clear um for example as I
 
03:56:35.830 --> 03:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
think I've mentioned to you I introduced
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
a bill one time on behalf of the
 
03:56:40.510 --> 03:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
domestic violence Co Coalition uh
 
03:56:43.710 --> 03:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
non-fatal strangulation I knew a bit
 
03:56:46.110 --> 03:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
about the bill but the lady s sitting
 
03:56:49.070 --> 03:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
behind me knew far more she was actually
 
03:56:50.830 --> 03:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist coming from the domestic
 
03:56:53.149 --> 03:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
violence Coalition she wasn't invited by
 
03:56:54.630 --> 03:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
the committee wasn't invited by the
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
chair but I asked her to be there to
 
03:57:01.469 --> 03:57:01.479 align:start position:0%
speak so if the chair recognized CH next
 
03:57:05.110 --> 03:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
to explain the intricacies of that bill
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
would that be permissible under this
 
03:57:09.110 --> 03:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
house rule
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
change no if the committee chair did not
 
03:57:14.469 --> 03:57:14.479 align:start position:0%
um you know make some arrangements to
 
03:57:17.070 --> 03:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
invite that person to speak if it was
 
03:57:19.389 --> 03:57:19.399 align:start position:0%
the the person introducing the bill um
 
03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
that would be in contravention of this
 
03:57:23.550 --> 03:57:23.560 align:start position:0%
rule okay thank
 
03:57:26.189 --> 03:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
you all right uh before we go any
 
03:57:29.630 --> 03:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
further uh we never never got a u a
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this a motion to
 
03:57:36.990 --> 03:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:40.269 --> 03:57:40.279 align:start position:0%
um uh you're the you're presenting it I
 
03:57:41.670 --> 03:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
I can't accept a motion from you
 
03:57:49.429 --> 03:57:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:51.750 --> 03:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
represent question then I I'll move to
 
03:57:51.760 --> 03:57:52.790 align:start position:0%
represent question then I I'll move to
accept

03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
accept
 
03:57:55.389 --> 03:57:55.399 align:start position:0%
it I will
 
03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
second okay um seeing that you presented
 
03:58:02.070 --> 03:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh Smith I if you're
 
03:58:04.030 --> 03:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
asked the question obviously answer it
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
but uh I would ask that you not
 
03:58:07.950 --> 03:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
participate in the discussion at this
 
03:58:10.710 --> 03:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
point um is there any further discussion
 
03:58:16.750 --> 03:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:16.760 --> 03:58:18.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:58:18.630 --> 03:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:58:20.750 --> 03:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Osborne are you
 
03:58:22.389 --> 03:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
talking yes I
 
03:58:24.590 --> 03:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
see if that's
 
03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
okay yeah representative Osborne yeah uh
 
03:58:31.710 --> 03:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
so I I guess um a couple
 
03:58:34.349 --> 03:58:34.359 align:start position:0%
things just this just doesn't seem to me
 
03:58:37.030 --> 03:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
something that belongs in house rules
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is the job of the committee chairs
 
03:58:43.389 --> 03:58:43.399 align:start position:0%
to uh to manage uh the process and and
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
their respons responsibility is to do so
 
03:58:48.990 --> 03:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
with the uh you know the best interests
 
03:58:52.990 --> 03:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
of of our constituents in mind uh it it
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
is not clear to me that it is
 
03:58:58.149 --> 03:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the um our constituents
 
03:59:00.510 --> 03:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
Advantage for lobbyists to get the last
 
03:59:04.510 --> 03:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
word in uh in in committee hearings uh
 
03:59:06.750 --> 03:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
there I'm sure there's lots of different
 
03:59:08.349 --> 03:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
reasons why you might want to get them
 
03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
out of the way first and then let the
 
03:59:14.149 --> 03:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
people have the last word so I I don't I
 
03:59:16.710 --> 03:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
don't think this is a good
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
idea thank you
 
03:59:23.910 --> 03:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
um I also obviously have been a uh
 
03:59:27.710 --> 03:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
chairman for 12 years at different
 
03:59:31.070 --> 03:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
points and I would hope that any
 
03:59:33.990 --> 03:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
chairman respects the public that are
 
03:59:35.630 --> 03:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
coming in to
 
03:59:37.990 --> 03:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
testify but in many
 
03:59:38.000 --> 03:59:39.670 align:start position:0%
testify but in many
cases

03:59:39.670 --> 03:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
cases
 
03:59:44.550 --> 03:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
a department head or in some cases
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyists have much more in
 
03:59:50.710 --> 03:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
information to present on a subject
 
03:59:53.590 --> 03:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
matter than somebody from the public
 
03:59:56.229 --> 03:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
might it's absolutely imperative that
 
04:00:00.070 --> 04:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
the public uh be brought up as soon as
 
04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
possible but sometimes the public
 
04:00:05.550 --> 04:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have all the information that
 
04:00:07.630 --> 04:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
maybe a lobbyist or a department head
 
04:00:11.389 --> 04:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
might have that could help uh Identify
 
04:00:14.550 --> 04:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
some of the subject matter I I just
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
I just truly believe that if we whoever
 
04:00:22.309 --> 04:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
the majority is trains their chairman
 
04:00:25.269 --> 04:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
properly that we don't need this
 
04:00:26.750 --> 04:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
particular piece of
 
04:00:29.149 --> 04:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
legislation that's just my feeling I
 
04:00:32.750 --> 04:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
think it it not that it's maybe going to
 
04:00:35.110 --> 04:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
totally uh prevent the chairman from
 
04:00:37.630 --> 04:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
doing their job but I certainly think it
 
04:00:43.229 --> 04:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
does put a handicap on them um when I I
 
04:00:49.349 --> 04:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:51.750 --> 04:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
necessary is there any other further
 
04:00:56.590 --> 04:00:56.600 align:start position:0%
discussion I'm open if not yep Mr
 
04:01:01.030 --> 04:01:01.040 align:start position:0%

04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%

04:02:23.510 --> 04:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
um instead of having to worry about them
 
04:02:25.229 --> 04:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
at a future meeting we've been here this
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
long and we've only got what two or
 
04:02:29.670 --> 04:02:29.680 align:start position:0%

will that this represent Weber I'm just
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
going to bring up the fact that I have
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
um a commitment at 230 that I cannot
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
change and uh all of us have made the
 
04:02:57.469 --> 04:02:57.479 align:start position:0%
effort to be here and
 
04:03:02.990 --> 04:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
I am loath to say that I'm happy about a
 
04:03:06.309 --> 04:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
member who is not here uh when everybody
 
04:03:09.790 --> 04:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
else has made arrangements to be here um
 
04:03:16.269 --> 04:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:20.149 --> 04:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
and I might ask a question M of Mr
 
04:03:24.429 --> 04:03:24.439 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr chair yes in just in light of
 
04:03:26.910 --> 04:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
what representative Weber said uh when
 
04:03:29.389 --> 04:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
should she should she have to when she
 
04:03:32.950 --> 04:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
has to leave can representative Smith
 
04:03:36.189 --> 04:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
step in as an alternate for
 
04:03:39.429 --> 04:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
her representative Dem Smith no no
 
04:03:44.070 --> 04:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
marjerie sorry oh no no no no
 
04:03:45.950 --> 04:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying that in order we would
 
04:03:47.630 --> 04:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
like to be able to substitute to have a
 
04:03:51.670 --> 04:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
full to have a full a full contingent no
 
04:03:55.269 --> 04:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
I I understand um I I I would have to
 
04:03:59.469 --> 04:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
say at this point no because we haven't
 
04:04:01.030 --> 04:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
I mean that's been our standing rule
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much that you know um we have to
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh be notified beforehand if somebody's
 
04:04:09.910 --> 04:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
going to be there
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
um having said that if there's if if
 
04:04:15.149 --> 04:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be unanimous on on
 
04:04:17.229 --> 04:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
having that changed then we'll have to
 
04:04:20.590 --> 04:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
uh deal with this uh at a later basis I
 
04:04:22.469 --> 04:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
I do plan on having another rules
 
04:04:24.510 --> 04:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee meeting not too far in the
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
future okay so we will deal with this at
 
04:04:30.149 --> 04:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
another basis but yeah I um I think that
 
04:04:30.159 --> 04:04:31.550 align:start position:0%
another basis but yeah I um I think that
would

04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:04:34.630 --> 04:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
be thank you and I pretty much
 
04:04:37.550 --> 04:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
against can can I can I do this if we
 
04:04:39.550 --> 04:04:39.560 align:start position:0%
can get through the other two and get to
 
04:04:41.790 --> 04:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
this in time is that acceptable before
 
04:04:44.229 --> 04:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
you have to leave
 
04:04:46.349 --> 04:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to put roadblocks in
 
04:04:49.750 --> 04:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
people's way I I um simply want to
 
04:04:52.070 --> 04:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
apologize it never occurred to me that
 
04:04:54.750 --> 04:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
this was going to go until 2:30 um I
 
04:04:56.670 --> 04:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
assumed we were going to be out of here
 
04:04:59.870 --> 04:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
considerably earlier um I I would urge
 
04:05:02.510 --> 04:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I know that we use
 
04:05:05.149 --> 04:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
alternates in various of the other
 
04:05:08.830 --> 04:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
senior committees I I would urge that
 
04:05:12.910 --> 04:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
the uh chair consider using alternates
 
04:05:15.269 --> 04:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
in this committee as well to deal with
 
04:05:17.429 --> 04:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
these kinds of issues uh which will
 
04:05:19.429 --> 04:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
arise not only for me but for members of
 
04:05:22.149 --> 04:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
the majority as well so thank you I
 
04:05:24.149 --> 04:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
think that's a is that's an issue we can
 
04:05:26.229 --> 04:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
discuss representative thank you I
 
04:05:28.670 --> 04:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate the consideration uh why
 
04:05:31.070 --> 04:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't we move on to um representative
 
04:05:33.950 --> 04:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
yella Oella and see if we can't get
 
04:05:36.269 --> 04:05:36.279 align:start position:0%

this

04:06:47.389 --> 04:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%

meet how how often it will meet um if we
 
04:07:15.750 --> 04:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:18.830 --> 04:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
more fewer sessions longer days kind of
 
04:07:21.309 --> 04:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
a thing for more opportunities or fewer
 
04:07:26.590 --> 04:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities to um to meet because of
 
04:07:29.229 --> 04:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
the current
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
situation and there's also a lot of work
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done
 
04:07:38.590 --> 04:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
in um executive departments and

04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
regarding um
 
04:07:48.229 --> 04:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
the potential
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
for gathering
 
04:07:54.030 --> 04:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
information uh
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
regarding how covid money was spent um
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
and policies created around uh covid
 
04:08:06.750 --> 04:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
especially dur with these
 
04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
um me many bills having to do with you
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
know possibly refunding the money uh
 
04:08:18.590 --> 04:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
that was charged to people for for
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
disobeying the the guidances or how it
 
04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
might be affecting
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh different like the Personnel within
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
Administration um and so there may be
 
04:08:34.590 --> 04:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
things that
 
04:08:38.710 --> 04:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
these committees are trying to
 
04:08:42.910 --> 04:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
address and they may need to request it
 
04:08:42.920 --> 04:08:44.830 align:start position:0%
address and they may need to request it
in

04:08:44.830 --> 04:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:08:48.349 --> 04:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh such a way as to be kept private such
 
04:08:52.670 --> 04:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
a like a sealed um
 
04:08:56.109 --> 04:08:56.119 align:start position:0%
or trying to gather information which is
 
04:08:59.070 --> 04:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
part of an um ongoing investigation or
 
04:09:02.109 --> 04:09:02.119 align:start position:0%
something along those lines or um you
 
04:09:04.109 --> 04:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
know the cour a court
 
04:09:06.990 --> 04:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
action and trying to gather that
 
04:09:10.830 --> 04:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
information um via uh
 
04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
subpoena however
 
04:09:18.149 --> 04:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
with with the current rule uh vote of
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
the entire house would need to vote on
 
04:09:25.030 --> 04:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
that subpoena action and
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
so if it's if the um session days for
 
04:09:34.510 --> 04:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
the Full House are infrequent that may
 
04:09:38.429 --> 04:09:38.439 align:start position:0%
stifle the potential for these bills to
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
move forward and make it essentially
 
04:09:44.309 --> 04:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
impossible for these committees to have
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
the information needed to make up or
 
04:09:50.510 --> 04:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
down votes on these bills which may have
 
04:09:52.990 --> 04:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
the ramification of tur turning a lot of
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
these bills into study committees where
 
04:09:59.070 --> 04:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
there's more time to address the issues
 
04:10:03.189 --> 04:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
and that may leave people
 
04:10:03.199 --> 04:10:04.910 align:start position:0%
and that may leave people
with

04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:10:10.109 --> 04:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
their issues un addressed during this
 
04:10:15.030 --> 04:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
session this um year and
 
04:10:18.189 --> 04:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
and may be
 
04:10:22.790 --> 04:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily delayed and so my proposal
 
04:10:28.590 --> 04:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
is to allow these committees to um to
 
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
with a a vote of the committee request
 
04:10:35.389 --> 04:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
the information that is relevant to
 
04:10:38.469 --> 04:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
their uh the bills that they are working
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
on their their authorities within that
 
04:10:44.109 --> 04:10:44.119 align:start position:0%
committee so that they can do this work
 
04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
even in the case where uh the full house
 
04:10:51.070 --> 04:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
is not able to meet or to issue those
 
04:10:51.080 --> 04:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
is not able to meet or to issue those
those

04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:10:56.790 --> 04:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
um subpoenas in a timely fashion so that
 
04:10:59.109 --> 04:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
they can uh get the work that needs to
 
04:11:01.710 --> 04:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
be done in the committee's
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
completed thank you and I'm happy to
 
04:11:04.080 --> 04:11:06.030 align:start position:0%
completed thank you and I'm happy to
take

04:11:06.030 --> 04:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
questions stand up Mr chair uh
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
yeah can we get a um for discussion
 
04:11:16.349 --> 04:11:16.359 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to move that we not
 
04:11:20.349 --> 04:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
accept this okay second second second
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh am I speak to my motion yes
 
04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think that uh there's
 
04:11:28.910 --> 04:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
nothing that precludes any committee
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
right now from requesting information to
 
04:11:33.710 --> 04:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
be provided to it and in almost all
 
04:11:36.269 --> 04:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
instances I think it's forthcoming um
 
04:11:38.429 --> 04:11:38.439 align:start position:0%
that having been said the power to
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
subpoena is an awesome power that ought
 
04:11:44.349 --> 04:11:44.359 align:start position:0%
to be exercised with I think great
 
04:11:46.189 --> 04:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
restraint I think the current situation
 
04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
where a majority of the vote of the
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
house and the signature of the speaker
 
04:11:52.870 --> 04:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
are the appropriate means by which we
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
should have a subpoena issued in the
 
04:11:57.870 --> 04:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
name of the legislature to give it to a
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee I don't care if it's a
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote of any committee I wanted
 
04:12:04.870 --> 04:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
to the P subo to come back before here
 
04:12:07.710 --> 04:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
and also I think that um it's important
 
04:12:09.870 --> 04:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
that the rules committee help determine
 
04:12:12.109 --> 04:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
the form of the subpoena and and and
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
specify what condition if any are you
 
04:12:17.950 --> 04:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
know would be uh would condition the
 
04:12:21.030 --> 04:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
issuance um in use of subpoenas I think
 
04:12:25.269 --> 04:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:33.750 --> 04:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:38.149 --> 04:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
discussion um if I may representative
 
04:12:41.950 --> 04:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
Osborne thank you so um so a couple
 
04:12:45.910 --> 04:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
things as I think it's uh probably not
 
04:12:48.030 --> 04:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate to uh Grant this kind of
 
04:12:51.309 --> 04:12:51.319 align:start position:0%
power just to select uh committees uh if
 
04:12:54.750 --> 04:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
we were really uh going to consider it
 
04:12:57.229 --> 04:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
it seems like we would you know apply it
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
equally to to all committees um so I
 
04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
can't uh you know I haven't been around
 
04:13:04.870 --> 04:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
as long as you know many of us in in in
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
my time uh in the house I've only been
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
involved with a small you know
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
percentage of of of the work that's been
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
taken up in that time but I've never
 
04:13:15.309 --> 04:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
heard of you know any departments or
 
04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
agencies being not willing to share the
 
04:13:21.269 --> 04:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
information that they've been requested
 
04:13:26.349 --> 04:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
of them um and and I believe that uh um
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know setting up an oppositional
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
posture uh with with a rule change like
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
this uh is not going to do us any favors
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
in in being able to to work
 
04:13:40.510 --> 04:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
cooperatively with them and I think
 
04:13:42.030 --> 04:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
a a weapon you only pull out at the
 
04:13:46.910 --> 04:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
least Resort and I I've never seen it
 
04:13:48.910 --> 04:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
pulled out and uh I hope we don't ever
 
04:13:51.109 --> 04:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:13:54.149 --> 04:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me a dangerous thing to
 
04:13:54.159 --> 04:13:56.030 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me a dangerous thing to
be

04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:13:59.309 --> 04:13:59.319 align:start position:0%
considering that's all share just a a
 
04:14:01.630 --> 04:14:01.640 align:start position:0%
quick point of reference yes yes Mr
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
Clark uh the last time that the house
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
issued a subpoena was during the
 
04:14:10.429 --> 04:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
impeachment hearings uh back 2000 so the
 
04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
the the uh um it is representative
 
04:14:16.550 --> 04:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
Cushing said an awesome um
 
04:14:18.990 --> 04:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
tool when was that Paul the last time
 
04:14:21.870 --> 04:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
that was uh the the impeachment of the J
 
04:14:25.870 --> 04:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
oh just Brock yes I sat on that
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee you uh represent Tim Smith has
 
04:14:32.349 --> 04:14:32.359 align:start position:0%
his hand up Sir okay representative
 
04:14:36.389 --> 04:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
Smith Tim Smith I believe or Steve no
 
04:14:39.229 --> 04:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
it's me thank you Mr chairman okay um I
 
04:14:42.429 --> 04:14:42.439 align:start position:0%
I'd like to um agree emphatically with
 
04:14:44.990 --> 04:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
what represent resentative Osborne said
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
um you know my my primary issue with
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:14:55.229 --> 04:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
not the the topic of reexamining you
 
04:14:57.910 --> 04:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
know the subpoena power of the house um
 
04:15:00.389 --> 04:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
you know that's that that's a a separate
 
04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
discussion that could be had my my
 
04:15:04.510 --> 04:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
primary issue with this is that it's
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
reexamining the subpoena power of the
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
house only for a couple of specific
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
committees um and that that bothers me
 
04:15:16.189 --> 04:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
quite a bit I
 
04:15:18.630 --> 04:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
don't I don't like anything that we put
 
04:15:20.389 --> 04:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
in rules that makes one committee
 
04:15:22.109 --> 04:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
special and another committee not
 
04:15:24.550 --> 04:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
special and and something like this that
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
would Grant special powers to only a
 
04:15:30.349 --> 04:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
couple of committees while leaving the
 
04:15:33.510 --> 04:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
rest to follow a more normal procedure
 
04:15:36.030 --> 04:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
um it just doesn't make me feel right at
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
the end of the day so I I can't support
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
this and I I would very strongly Echo
 
04:15:42.269 --> 04:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
the concerns that representative Osborne
 
04:15:42.279 --> 04:15:44.149 align:start position:0%
the concerns that representative Osborne
raised

04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
raised
 
04:15:49.309 --> 04:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion or okay uh the
 
04:15:51.510 --> 04:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
motion is to not accept
 
04:15:53.910 --> 04:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
the Mr clerk would you call the role
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%

04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%

the chair recogniz you please oh that
 
04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:46.710 --> 04:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman by your leave uh go
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
ahead representative Oregon okay the uh
 
04:17:52.630 --> 04:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
there the first thing is um this is a
 
04:17:54.910 --> 04:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
rule 67 and you already passed the rule
 
04:17:57.630 --> 04:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
67 so in the event that you choose to
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
move forward this you either have to re
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
it probably rule 68 or rule 67f whatever
 
04:18:08.950 --> 04:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
but um basically uh and also a while ago
 
04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion about guns in the
 
04:18:12.030 --> 04:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
chamber and people said they needed to
 
04:18:15.429 --> 04:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
be protected from from violence and
 
04:18:18.109 --> 04:18:18.119 align:start position:0%
certainly violence is problem in our
 
04:18:20.590 --> 04:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
society especially gun violence but it
 
04:18:22.750 --> 04:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
guns are not having a gun is not a
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
perfect uh is not a perfect precaution
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
and I admit that masss are not a perfect
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
precaution but they're way more they're
 
04:18:32.750 --> 04:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
almost they're extremely but they are
 
04:18:35.349 --> 04:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
extremely effective so it's it's about I
 
04:18:37.870 --> 04:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
think it's about 99% or so and certainly
 
04:18:40.950 --> 04:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
much more effective than a gun is and
 
04:18:44.790 --> 04:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
against violence and also um you know we
 
04:18:46.590 --> 04:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
we have the more people are dying every
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
day than have than died on 9/11 so and
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
um this depping has killed more people
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
than any event United States except the
 
04:18:56.950 --> 04:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
Civil War and the Civil War went on for
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
four years and the pandemic's only gone
 
04:19:02.429 --> 04:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
for nine months this is an extremely uh
 
04:19:04.389 --> 04:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
it's an extremely serious uh threat to
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
all of us as we know all too well with
 
04:19:09.630 --> 04:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
the tragic death of Speaker hinch and I
 
04:19:11.149 --> 04:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
so i' like to thank speaker hinch and
 
04:19:14.429 --> 04:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
Speaker shirle for the and um and and
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
yourself Mr chair acting speaker Packer
 
04:19:17.910 --> 04:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
for the leadership you've shown since
 
04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
March but I think um one place where we
 
04:19:23.389 --> 04:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
things fell down a bit was on the issue
 
04:19:26.590 --> 04:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
of mass I think um and you have good
 
04:19:28.030 --> 04:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
reasons for doing this but I think you
 
04:19:30.149 --> 04:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
know we as a house we kind of enabled
 
04:19:32.309 --> 04:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
the mass refusers more than we needed to
 
04:19:35.229 --> 04:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
um you know so the majority of us who
 
04:19:36.990 --> 04:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
take the pandemic seriously and believe
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
in silence were forced to Comedy those
 
04:19:41.950 --> 04:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
who uh didn't understand that masss are
 
04:19:45.990 --> 04:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
necessary for caution um and uh remember
 
04:19:47.950 --> 04:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
Reverend Step Smith hunt Channel 9 about
 
04:19:50.429 --> 04:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
Walmart say we can go to meeting in we
 
04:19:52.030 --> 04:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
can go shop at Walmart why can't we go
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
to meeting in person now Walmart a
 
04:19:56.149 --> 04:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
typical Walmart store is the size of the
 
04:19:58.870 --> 04:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
entire State House campus and there's a
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
only a few dozen people in there and
 
04:20:02.149 --> 04:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
they have social distancing and they
 
04:20:05.149 --> 04:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
have those shelves of goods so it's it's
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh just because so like we need to take
 
04:20:09.550 --> 04:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
more precaution take a Walmart and
 
04:20:11.389 --> 04:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
course to Walmart pretty much everyone
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
if you go into I don't go that often by
 
04:20:15.790 --> 04:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
go to market Bas and hfer a lot
 
04:20:17.229 --> 04:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
everybody's messed up they're banging
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
the lines on the aisle so they're really
 
04:20:21.149 --> 04:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
most people are not making a big fuss
 
04:20:22.710 --> 04:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
over the mass requirement it's just sort
 
04:20:25.070 --> 04:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
of a minority which is uh unfortunately
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
represented over represented in the in
 
04:20:30.389 --> 04:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
the house so I'm and right now if you
 
04:20:31.630 --> 04:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to be around a bunch of
 
04:20:32.990 --> 04:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
people wearing masks your only other
 
04:20:36.429 --> 04:20:36.439 align:start position:0%
choice is to stay home as 130 of us not
 
04:20:38.950 --> 04:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
including May 130 of us stayed home for
 
04:20:40.990 --> 04:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
organization day because I didn't
 
04:20:43.710 --> 04:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
basically um they didn't want to taste
 
04:20:46.590 --> 04:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
the risk of being infected and a lot of
 
04:20:48.030 --> 04:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
them would have stayed away even if they
 
04:20:49.870 --> 04:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
were confident that we were all wearing
 
04:20:52.910 --> 04:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
masks but um you know probably a large
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
number of them were there probably just
 
04:20:55.630 --> 04:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
because of the just because they knew
 
04:20:56.990 --> 04:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
there was going to be a large mass free
 
04:20:59.309 --> 04:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
section and the whole thing whole thing
 
04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
was I think turned the opposite way
 
04:21:02.950 --> 04:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
around um so those who don't like
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
wearing masks they expected the rest of
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
us to accommodate them and I think uh
 
04:21:10.630 --> 04:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
going forward the house they you know
 
04:21:13.030 --> 04:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
the people who hate masks and I'm not
 
04:21:14.590 --> 04:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
really crazy about it myself with always
 
04:21:17.189 --> 04:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
wearing but the people who think masks
 
04:21:19.030 --> 04:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
are necessary they hate masks um they
 
04:21:20.590 --> 04:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
should accommodate the rest of us so if
 
04:21:23.830 --> 04:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
they want to be pres in person for house
 
04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
session committee meeting they should
 
04:21:26.349 --> 04:21:26.359 align:start position:0%
they should wear the mask for the few
 
04:21:29.429 --> 04:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
hours needed needed for the meeting you
 
04:21:31.149 --> 04:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
know they can um they can do what they
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
want once they're back in their cars
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
once they're driving home but I think uh
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
I think that's not an unreasonable ask
 
04:21:39.109 --> 04:21:39.119 align:start position:0%
the they're fairly the only Health um
 
04:21:41.229 --> 04:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
complications that I've I've seen people
 
04:21:44.910 --> 04:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
really claim at all you know usually or
 
04:21:47.590 --> 04:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
hypoxia um you know with CO2 building up
 
04:21:49.550 --> 04:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
behind the mass or anxiety attacks and I
 
04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
want to minimize anxiety attacks I
 
04:21:53.950 --> 04:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
actually had one at the last last house
 
04:21:55.429 --> 04:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
session because my other the reasons I
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
was very nervous being downwind from
 
04:22:00.269 --> 04:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
between 16 80 people who are not messed
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
up would even more anxious if I known
 
04:22:06.070 --> 04:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
that um you know our speaker our new
 
04:22:07.750 --> 04:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
elected speaker going to die in a week
 
04:22:09.790 --> 04:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
you know that what a horrible that's
 
04:22:11.269 --> 04:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
like most horrible thing that's happened
 
04:22:13.630 --> 04:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
to me since I been in the house you know
 
04:22:15.990 --> 04:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
even regardless of your party we we miss
 
04:22:18.349 --> 04:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
him terribly and he he did die week
 
04:22:20.109 --> 04:22:20.119 align:start position:0%
after the meeting I will admit he was
 
04:22:22.389 --> 04:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask at the meeting so they
 
04:22:24.510 --> 04:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
don't which proves they're not a perfect
 
04:22:27.309 --> 04:22:27.319 align:start position:0%
precaution but you know I think I think
 
04:22:29.269 --> 04:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
they they should accomodate they should
 
04:22:30.830 --> 04:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
comate us they don't want to run Mass
 
04:22:32.790 --> 04:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
they can either participate remotely and
 
04:22:36.269 --> 04:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
I hope we'll expand our remote options
 
04:22:38.429 --> 04:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
um or they can just stay home because we
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
we you know we we we is a house we're an
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
inclusive house we try to accommodate as
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
many as people's medical conditions as
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
much as we can but um we can't
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
accommodate everyone you know certainly
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't let somebody in the house
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
who had Ebola you know we wouldn't let
 
04:22:56.790 --> 04:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
somebody in the house who had you know
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
Tourette Syndrome um or variety of other
 
04:23:02.109 --> 04:23:02.119 align:start position:0%
consequen I think it's perfectly
 
04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable to require everyone to wear a
 
04:23:04.910 --> 04:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
mask while they're in the hall you know
 
04:23:07.710 --> 04:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't you can't really force him to
 
04:23:10.149 --> 04:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
do it outside the hall but um I think
 
04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's a reasonable reasonable ass also
 
04:23:14.510 --> 04:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
a good example some people call that
 
04:23:16.189 --> 04:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
virtu signaling but I think setting a
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
good example is Right term to you
 
04:23:19.710 --> 04:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
example I don't think it's good for
 
04:23:21.510 --> 04:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
those pictures we saw dozens of us you
 
04:23:23.590 --> 04:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
know sitting on the field hockey field
 
04:23:25.389 --> 04:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
without mass on I think that was just
 
04:23:27.149 --> 04:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
really appalling and ridiculous and they
 
04:23:28.950 --> 04:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
look much worse than they thought they
 
04:23:31.389 --> 04:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
did so not that I haven't looked bad
 
04:23:33.750 --> 04:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
myself in the past but so that's uh
 
04:23:35.750 --> 04:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
basically is a mass bill which frankly
 
04:23:39.389 --> 04:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
has no exemptions um so you you it's
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
impossible you don't want to take the
 
04:23:43.710 --> 04:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
risk you know I I think it's probably
 
04:23:45.070 --> 04:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
just about anyone can at least wear a
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
plastic face shield you know so
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
regardless of what
 
04:23:50.510 --> 04:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
respiratory conditions you have so
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's my uh that's my bill so
 
04:23:55.710 --> 04:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
that's basically my uh that's basically
 
04:23:57.550 --> 04:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
my proposal so it would uh it would
 
04:24:00.630 --> 04:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
apply not just to U in person session
 
04:24:02.309 --> 04:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
days but also to committee hearings or
 
04:24:05.429 --> 04:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
really um any other any other proceeding
 
04:24:07.910 --> 04:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
which includes as I've heard we had
 
04:24:09.550 --> 04:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
problems with people going un masked you
 
04:24:11.670 --> 04:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
know up on the third floor of the state
 
04:24:14.750 --> 04:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
house um that's a probably probably
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
should have just read the read the I
 
04:24:17.349 --> 04:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
probably could explain it quicker just
 
04:24:18.590 --> 04:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
by reading the whole thing but you all
 
04:24:20.269 --> 04:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
have it here so that's that's that's my
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh that's my proposal basically mask up
 
04:24:25.990 --> 04:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
or or stay home which I hate to tell any
 
04:24:29.229 --> 04:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
M to stay home but um sometime may be
 
04:24:31.070 --> 04:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
necessary and certainly it's better than
 
04:24:32.910 --> 04:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
really the terrible situation we had at
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
the Ford meeting we had a UNH which I
 
04:24:38.070 --> 04:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
know um PE my constituents are extremely
 
04:24:40.030 --> 04:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
unhappy that so many unass people were
 
04:24:41.710 --> 04:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
there and I know UNH isn't happy about
 
04:24:43.309 --> 04:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
it when you come
 
04:24:44.990 --> 04:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
we came up with the ingenious slightly
 
04:24:46.670 --> 04:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
strange proposal to holding on the field
 
04:24:48.269 --> 04:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
hockey field which luckily we had a nice
 
04:24:50.429 --> 04:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
day and then there's rumors about we're
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
gonna try to have a drive-in meeting and
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
I like I have no no idea how that would
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
work but I think a simpler simpler thing
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
if we have have an imp person meeting is
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
just tell everyone The Mask up and of
 
04:25:03.309 --> 04:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
course if we can get remote options in
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
place we should provide those too either
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
for those who don't feel safe going in
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
at all those who would be happy to go
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
but only if we don't make them wear a
 
04:25:12.349 --> 04:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
mask so they can stay home and be on
 
04:25:13.750 --> 04:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
mess just as those who worried about
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
being infected can could participate
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
remotely and not have to worry about
 
04:25:19.349 --> 04:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
being infected so that's uh thank you
 
04:25:22.109 --> 04:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
very much for listening um and uh I know
 
04:25:23.710 --> 04:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
You' had a long day and a lot to absorb
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
but um glad you're glad you took the
 
04:25:27.830 --> 04:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
time to listen to me too and I would be
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if anybody
 
04:25:29.439 --> 04:25:32.790 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if anybody
has

04:25:32.790 --> 04:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:32.800 --> 04:25:37.590 align:start position:0%
 
them

04:25:37.590 --> 04:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.349 --> 04:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
I'll move to not accept this okay I'll
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
second representative Smith moves not to
 
04:25:51.269 --> 04:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
accept and it's seconded discussion may
 
04:25:55.149 --> 04:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
I speak to that you may Mr SM repr Smith
 
04:25:57.750 --> 04:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so
 
04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
um I get where he's coming from and I'm
 
04:26:02.750 --> 04:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
sorry he didn't understand some of the
 
04:26:04.750 --> 04:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
things I said in that interview because
 
04:26:06.590 --> 04:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
that was a total mischaracterization of
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
where I'm coming from but we're here to
 
04:26:10.189 --> 04:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
look at the rules and the technical
 
04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
parts of it the first vaccine are
 
04:26:14.349 --> 04:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
already rolling out and it is likely
 
04:26:16.510 --> 04:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
that while we are still in session we'll
 
04:26:19.070 --> 04:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
get to a point where the CDC
 
04:26:20.309 --> 04:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that we don't have to
 
04:26:23.149 --> 04:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
do the masks anymore but this says the
 
04:26:25.790 --> 04:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
rule won't repeal until such time as the
 
04:26:29.070 --> 04:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
state of emergency is lifted or
 
04:26:31.870 --> 04:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
expires we are likely to maintain the
 
04:26:34.830 --> 04:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
state of emergency long after the the
 
04:26:37.389 --> 04:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
need for extensive public protections
 
04:26:39.990 --> 04:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
are needed just to stay eligible for
 
04:26:42.389 --> 04:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
federal funding for businesses that have
 
04:26:44.309 --> 04:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
suffering to extend unemployment
 
04:26:46.670 --> 04:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
benefits if that's what's required this
 
04:26:49.550 --> 04:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any distinction there so um
 
04:26:52.710 --> 04:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's just not ready uh
 
04:26:55.149 --> 04:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
poorly thought out needs more work can't
 
04:26:57.389 --> 04:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
vote for it in its current
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
form Z Tim
 
04:27:02.910 --> 04:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chairman um I have a
 
04:27:05.149 --> 04:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
a question of procedure um for yourself
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
or possibly for the clerk um and to to
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
put context where I'm coming from I I
 
04:27:14.030 --> 04:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
share Representative Steve Smith's
 
04:27:17.469 --> 04:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
concern um over some of the language my
 
04:27:22.510 --> 04:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
question is is if the the motion not to
 
04:27:24.950 --> 04:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
sign off on this were to
 
04:27:27.790 --> 04:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
fail um would a motion to change the
 
04:27:30.670 --> 04:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
language then be in order um and
 
04:27:32.349 --> 04:27:32.359 align:start position:0%
regardless of how that turns out I
 
04:27:34.030 --> 04:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
believe Mr chairman you mentioned that
 
04:27:36.070 --> 04:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to be meeting at least once
 
04:27:38.710 --> 04:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
more um before the next regular house
 
04:27:42.269 --> 04:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
session so you know if
 
04:27:44.189 --> 04:27:44.199 align:start position:0%
if the committee finds itself in in in
 
04:27:46.189 --> 04:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
agreement with the intent of this but
 
04:27:48.750 --> 04:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
not the language um there'd be another
 
04:27:51.550 --> 04:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
attempt for us as the rules committee to
 
04:27:54.389 --> 04:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
discuss this in the meantime and you
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
know consider alternative language in
 
04:27:57.040 --> 04:27:58.070 align:start position:0%
know consider alternative language in
the

04:27:58.070 --> 04:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:00.630 --> 04:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
future well I I would hope that we'd
 
04:28:04.189 --> 04:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
always have the chance to uh um you know
 
04:28:06.269 --> 04:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
discuss you know any issue that's
 
04:28:08.750 --> 04:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
brought before us I'm sorry my my
 
04:28:10.550 --> 04:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
apologies to clarify I meant before the
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
next house session oh before the next
 
04:28:14.670 --> 04:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
house session
 
04:28:17.429 --> 04:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
um I I believe we could do that Mr CL
 
04:28:17.439 --> 04:28:19.870 align:start position:0%
um I I believe we could do that Mr CL
couldn't

04:28:19.870 --> 04:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:22.269 --> 04:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
we if if you wanna if you want to have
 
04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%

however we do have one that goes
 
04:28:35.309 --> 04:28:35.319 align:start position:0%

04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
schedule another one um that it really
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
would have to be either before Thursday
 
04:28:42.750 --> 04:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
of next week or
 
04:28:45.870 --> 04:28:45.880 align:start position:0%

04:28:48.070 --> 04:28:48.080 align:start position:0%

notice today uh for or tomorrow at the
 
04:28:54.429 --> 04:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
latest for for said meeting um I just do
 
04:28:58.149 --> 04:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
want to clarify one one quick Point um
 
04:29:00.149 --> 04:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
Mr uh chairman and members of the
 
04:29:03.870 --> 04:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative Horgan um at my
 
04:29:06.870 --> 04:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion put in that last sentence and
 
04:29:09.229 --> 04:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
the reason for that was because I I
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
specifically asked the question along
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
lines of of what Representative Steve
 
04:29:16.030 --> 04:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
Smith asked about what happens at such a
 
04:29:19.550 --> 04:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
time where this rule um you know we we
 
04:29:22.870 --> 04:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
do pass a point where the CDC changes
 
04:29:26.750 --> 04:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
its guidelines and um you know this rule
 
04:29:29.189 --> 04:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
is still on the books requiring members
 
04:29:34.590 --> 04:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
to uh wear masks and so uh it it at my
 
04:29:37.469 --> 04:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
sort of uh discussion with him is why he
 
04:29:39.990 --> 04:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
put that that sentence in there so I
 
04:29:43.349 --> 04:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
apologize if there's uh any confusion
 
04:29:46.309 --> 04:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
about that the the uh it seemed at that
 
04:29:48.630 --> 04:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
time that that sort of seemed like the
 
04:29:48.640 --> 04:29:50.229 align:start position:0%
time that that sort of seemed like the
logical

04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
logical
 
04:29:53.950 --> 04:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
thing okay representative Horgan would
 
04:29:56.790 --> 04:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
like that Mr chair just see yeah the
 
04:29:59.550 --> 04:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
clerk's the clerk uh summary of how the
 
04:30:02.429 --> 04:30:02.439 align:start position:0%
Scott Wordsmith is correct that was a
 
04:30:04.030 --> 04:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
that was a flaw that he saw in the bill
 
04:30:06.429 --> 04:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
my original thinking was just that we
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
were probably be eager to repeal this
 
04:30:10.070 --> 04:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
Mass requirement as soon as we could so
 
04:30:12.429 --> 04:30:12.439 align:start position:0%
there be no probably be a little
 
04:30:14.630 --> 04:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
difficulty once everyone's satisfied we
 
04:30:16.750 --> 04:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
have the all the all clear that wouldn't
 
04:30:18.189 --> 04:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
be hard to get a two-thirds vote to
 
04:30:20.550 --> 04:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
suspend the rule and eliminate it but
 
04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
this is a cleaner way to do it that like
 
04:30:25.109 --> 04:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
so like it'll automatically Sunset um
 
04:30:27.189 --> 04:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
when the state of emergency goes
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
away I'm sure some members will still be
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
wearing masks like long after the
 
04:30:33.389 --> 04:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
emergency goes away because I'm sure the
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
fear habits once acquired die hard and I
 
04:30:37.550 --> 04:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
think the fear is going to take a long
 
04:30:39.469 --> 04:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
time to go
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
away Cushing has his hand up Mr chairman
 
04:30:46.590 --> 04:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:50.189 --> 04:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.950 --> 04:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
sir represent cushion you're
 
04:30:56.710 --> 04:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
muted sorry and while while you know
 
04:30:58.710 --> 04:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
there is a deadline for uh a house
 
04:31:00.670 --> 04:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
calendar that goes out tomorrow it
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
certainly happens all the time not all
 
04:31:03.990 --> 04:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
the time but there there could be a
 
04:31:06.149 --> 04:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
supplemental calendar that could be sent
 
04:31:09.429 --> 04:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
out electronically as as it is if if the
 
04:31:12.189 --> 04:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
speaker or the chair thought it it would
 
04:31:15.149 --> 04:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
be important to schedule another rules
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh meeting soon where um assuming if
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns about how this
 
04:31:24.149 --> 04:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
language is Wordsmith and the the
 
04:31:26.229 --> 04:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor wanted to withdraw it and bring
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
it back at the next time and maybe
 
04:31:30.269 --> 04:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
working with other people that could
 
04:31:32.269 --> 04:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
that could happen and we could still
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
address the masks in a timely
 
04:31:38.189 --> 04:31:38.199 align:start position:0%
fashion it's up to the sponsor we can
 
04:31:40.030 --> 04:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
either vote on it or we can he can
 
04:31:42.870 --> 04:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
withdraw it like uh uh representative
 
04:31:44.910 --> 04:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
Prout did for a couple of his to to work
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
on them and bring them back to us so
 
04:31:49.030 --> 04:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's up to to
 
04:31:52.269 --> 04:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Smith has is
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
Henry's uh which one I'm sorry uh
 
04:31:58.309 --> 04:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
Timothy oh represent Smith Tim Smith go
 
04:32:02.469 --> 04:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
ahead thanks um I uh I just want to to
 
04:32:06.070 --> 04:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
clarify um so that I I know how to vote
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
on the pending question the pending
 
04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
question is to not concur with the
 
04:32:14.349 --> 04:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
language in the amendment um if I my my
 
04:32:15.710 --> 04:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is that in order to
 
04:32:18.670 --> 04:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
introduce an amendment to the amendment
 
04:32:21.389 --> 04:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
um we would need to be on a question to
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
correct yes yeah if we're gonna kill it
 
04:32:30.510 --> 04:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
it's you know we can't amend something
 
04:32:32.429 --> 04:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
we're GNA kill right okay I just wanted
 
04:32:34.950 --> 04:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure um because I I do have some
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
text changes i' I'd like to propose as
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the amendment um but I I
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to go out of procedure to
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
attempt that thank you very much if if
 
04:32:45.710 --> 04:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan does wish to
 
04:32:49.229 --> 04:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
withdraw for the time being um he he can
 
04:32:51.750 --> 04:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
certainly do that and you all can
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
address that offline I mean I'm I'm
 
04:32:57.070 --> 04:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
amenable to a different mass restriction
 
04:32:59.070 --> 04:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't know whether procedurally it
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
makes any difference
 
04:33:03.670 --> 04:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
if if I withdraw this motion or whe
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
whether it it dies and then um a
 
04:33:08.869 --> 04:33:08.879 align:start position:0%
subsequent similar proposal can be
 
04:33:11.510 --> 04:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
introduced at a later meeting so I would
 
04:33:13.629 --> 04:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
also just just State Mr chairman and
 
04:33:15.070 --> 04:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that even if
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
the committee does not meet again before
 
04:33:20.310 --> 04:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
our session of January 6 we do have um
 
04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
the ability for floor amendments to
 
04:33:24.510 --> 04:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
house rules um which uh representative
 
04:33:26.349 --> 04:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
Tim Smith knows about because that's how
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
he's gotten that rule passed in the past
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
on a one rule 100 so um you know that is
 
04:33:34.269 --> 04:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
that is an option uh that if the
 
04:33:35.750 --> 04:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
committee does not meet the floor
 
04:33:38.029 --> 04:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
amendments can be
 
04:33:41.109 --> 04:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
brought uh represent question just a a
 
04:33:43.629 --> 04:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
question of the chair um do you have in
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
mind an approximate date when we might
 
04:33:50.551 --> 04:33:50.561 align:start position:0%
uh reconvene um as a rules committee as
 
04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
of as of right now no I I'm going to be
 
04:33:57.070 --> 04:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
conferring with the clerk and um and to
 
04:33:59.070 --> 04:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
see what um you know what we have ahead
 
04:34:01.390 --> 04:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
of us and where we're at and that's why
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
I say we might have one and and again it
 
04:34:06.910 --> 04:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
might it might be afterwards but uh you
 
04:34:08.551 --> 04:34:08.561 align:start position:0%
know we'll have to assess where we're at
 
04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:15.390 --> 04:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
so I I I don't want to give you a
 
04:34:17.510 --> 04:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
definitive date right
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
now I do think too Mr Mr chairman since
 
04:34:23.070 --> 04:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh since you had agreement earlier on to
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
to extend the date to adopt uh rules uh
 
04:34:30.429 --> 04:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
beyond the January 5 15th deadline um to
 
04:34:32.349 --> 04:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
the second session day you know there is
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
ample time as well for for further
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:47.189 --> 04:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
um did did representative hargan are you
 
04:34:51.869 --> 04:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
going to withdraw this or you want us to
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
take a vote on it um I would I would be
 
04:34:57.390 --> 04:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
just as happy to take a take a vote on
 
04:35:00.029 --> 04:35:00.039 align:start position:0%
it um if there's something
 
04:35:03.510 --> 04:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay we continue a stronger proposal in
 
04:35:05.029 --> 04:35:05.039 align:start position:0%
the future and of course
 
04:35:07.990 --> 04:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
also if we if this goes to the floor and
 
04:35:10.109 --> 04:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
gets voted on that obviously doesn't
 
04:35:12.390 --> 04:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
affect the next session which is tally
 
04:35:14.429 --> 04:35:14.439 align:start position:0%
schedule for the anal Recreation Center
 
04:35:18.429 --> 04:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
un so doesn't either way we either way
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
um either way that's not going to affect
 
04:35:22.150 --> 04:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
what the rules are for that session it's
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
also course it's also do something
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
probably could be handled you know
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
culturally within the caucuses you
 
04:35:28.639 --> 04:35:30.269 align:start position:0%
